What makes German manufacturing plants move locations?,"AbstractIn this paper, the relocation decisions of manufacturing plants across the NUTS-3 regions of the German economy are investigated. A relocation decision concerns whether a plant (an incumbent) moves its location from one region to another over a given time period or whether it remains in the same region. This decision is distinct from a location decision (of a start-up). To analyze the relocations of plants, the rich information of the official German regional statistics as well as the official German firm statistics that are maintained by the German Federal Statistical Office and the Statistical Offices of the Federal States is exploited for the first time. Both pull and push factors that influence relocation decisions are investigated. The results reveal that, in particular, regional road infrastructure and accessibility of regions as well as the quality of the available labor force positively affect the decision to relocate a plant in the German economy. A reduction of 10% in travel time by road to reach the three nearest agglomeration centers leads to an increase in relocation probability of about 9.5% on average. Policy implications involve the need for improvement of accessibility and infrastructure as well as incentives to support human capital in order to attract businesses to move to a region.",step2,True
"Indigenous residential segregation in towns and cities, 1976–2016","Indigenous people tend to live in different parts of Australian towns and cities than the non-Indigenous population. This is due to a combination of historic and contemporary government policies, the agency of Indigenous people, and the constraints placed on residential location by the interaction of the housing and labour markets. This study traces the trajectory of Indigenous residential segregation in 60 Australian towns and cities, using census data from 1976 to 2016. Segregation is measured using the index of dissimilarity and the threshold method. Indigenous residential segregation has been declining steadily since 1976 nationally. However, there has been a great deal of variation in segregation trajectories among towns and cities.  In Sydney and Melbourne, segregation remained relatively high over the study period. The level of segregation in 1976 appears to be related to the geographical remoteness of the town, with remote towns generally having lower levels of segregation in 1976. Segregation has been decreasing most rapidly in regional towns in New South Wales and Queensland. Finally, this study has found a long-run increase in the proportion of Indigenous residents living in highly Indigenous neighbourhoods, consistent with the increasingly close settlement of Indigenous people in Australian towns and cities. This trend is at odds with the apparent decrease in segregation found when segregation is measured using the index of dissimilarity. Detailed case studies may be required that examine how concrete historical geographies and policy legacies combine with contemporary housing markets to produce the configuration of segregation that we see today.",step2,True
The Economic Impact of Manufacturing Extension Centers," A recent U.S. Census survey indicates that two Illinois manufacturing extension centers affiliated with the national Manufacturing Extension Partnership have improved the performance of small Illinois firms and the Illinois state economy. During a 2-year period, the centers directly helped client firms create $22.5 million in sales and create or retain 483 jobs. These benefits, through their direct and indirect effects on the state economy, generated an estimated $119 million in new state output and 450 new state jobs during a 4-year period. State and local tax revenues increased by $9.5 million during the same period, comparing favorably with the $6 million 2-year funding for the two centers. These client-firm impacts occurred in industries important to state economic growth, high-wage employment, and competitiveness relative to the rest of the nation. ",step2,True

American Children in Multiracial Households," This study provides a demographic portrait of multiracial households, using children as the units of analysis. The authors conceptualize three dimensions for understanding multiracialness: (1) the racial composition of a household overall, (2) where in the household a racial difference exists relative to the household head, and (3) where in the household a racial difference exists relative to each child. Using microdata from the 1980 U.S. census, the authors explore the first two of these dimensions and test two propositions about the links between racial diversity and other nonracial attributes of children's household environments. The finding is made, among other things, that the largest proportion of children live in Asian-white households, and that about 60% live in households headed by mixed-race couples. Support for the notion that attributes of multiracial households fall between those of their same-race counterparts was mixed. Nonetheless, there appears to be a link between location of diversity and some nonracial characteristics of the household. ",step2,True
PD25 Principal Component Approximation: Medical Expenditure Panel Survey,"Introduction:Principal component analysis (PCA) is important to summarize data or reduce dimensionality. However, one disadvantage of using PCA is the interpretability of the principal components (PCs), especially in a high-dimensional database. This study aims to analyze the patterns of variance accumulation according to PCA loadings and to approximate PCs with input variables from sample data sets.Methods:There were three data sets of various sizes used to understand the performance of PC approximation: Hitters; SF-12v2 subset of the 2004 to 2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS); and, the full set of 1996 to 2011 MEPS data. The variables in three data sets were first centered and scaled before PCA. PCs approximation was studied with two approaches. First, the PC loadings were squared to estimate the variance contribution by variables to PCs. The other method was to use forward-stepwise regression to approximate PCs with all input variables.Results:The first few PCs represented large portions of total variances in each data set. Approximating PCs using stepwise regression could more efficiently identify the input variables that explain large portions of PC variances than approximating according to PCA loadings in three data sets. It required few numbers of variables to explain more than eighty percent of the PC variances.Conclusions:Approximating and interpreting PCs with stepwise regression is highly feasible. Approximating PCs can help i) interpret PCs with input variables, ii) understand the major sources of variances in data sets, iii) select unique sources of information and iv) search and rank input variables according to the proportions of PC variance explained. This is an approach to systematically understand databases and search for variables that are highly representative of databases.",step2,True
Location in Home Office,"In this project we investigate the well-being of full-time workers during the COVID-19 pandemic with special focus on the aspect of working from home. Within this domain, we look deeper into the meaning of the home and possible changes made to one’s home, especially the location from where the work is done. The COVID-19 pandemic forced many people into working from home to suppress the spreading of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus, even though many workers didn't have prior experience with teleworking. In order to mitigate possible negative effects of this sudden change, we strive to give empirically grounded recommendations on how to best organize one’s workplace. The topic of the home deserves special attention, since one’s dwelling is predominantly a space of restoration and separation from work, albeit having its own demands and stressors. The unforeseen and maybe even undesired intrusion of the work environment into the private environment poses a challenge onto individuals and their families/co-inhabitants. One such challenge is the separation of work and leisure, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, when outside leisure activities were also restricted. To help separate work from leisure, government agencies and private consulting firms recommended creating a separate space to work out of. This endeavor might entail the consumption of many resources since enacting active change in one’s surroundings requires effort and time. To find out, whether this change in one’s home leads to a better working experience and better restoration, we try to observe such changes in one’s work environment at home and to link them to subsequent changes in the work experience.

Specifically, we focus on the outcome of home-office self-efficacy. We hypothesize that having more physical separation between work and nonwork domains through a separate workspace or study, will lead to a greater feeling of self-efficacy as an indicator of resource level and a predictor of many other workplace outcomes. As underlying mechanisms for this association, we bring forward two processes: one of resource drain and one of resource restoration. We apply the lens of the social ecology of stress and restoration (Hartig et al., 2003) to measure the manifestation of these processes. This perspective suggests the existence of stress-restoration cycles, where resources need to be allocated towards coping with incoming demands and need to be replenished through restoration afterwards. These cycles happen regularly in so-called activity cycles, which take place in specific settings at specific times. Given the particular physical, psychological and social characteristics of a space and of the individual residing in it, the surrounding can have either a meaning of stressfulness or of capacity for restoration for the individual. In an empirical evaluation of this theory, Hartig et al. (2007) found preliminary support pointing towards a higher perception of the home as a place of stressfulness for teleworkers compared to non-teleworkers. We strife to understand this effect more closely by incorporating it as a mediator between the physical characteristic of the home (i.e. physical separation between work and nonwork domains at home) and home-office self-efficacy.

As the resource draining path, we expect the lack of a designated, separated workplace to act as a difficult working condition exacerbating domain conflicts and interrole transitioning efforts. Literature on role segregation and integration (e.g., Ashforth et al., 2000) suggests the existence of more or less integrated roles within one person – most prominently the work and nonwork/family roles. Based on the contrast between these roles regarding different locations, time of enactment, behavioral scripts and more, the transitioning between these roles happens more or less easily. Helping with these transitions are certain rites that people developed, facilitating role exit, movement, and role entry. We argue, that on the one hand, the contrast between the roles concerning behavioral scripts did not change in a systematic way due to the forced nature of working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning that task requirements and other role-defining work characteristics stayed essentially the same, as opposed to for example a situation where one decides voluntarily to move into the home-office since their task-characteristics changed and became more compatible with nonwork demands. On the other hand, the rites that facilitated role transitioning before, mainly those that were based on spatial separation, weren’t applicable anymore. Meanwhile, role transitions possibly became more frequent because the domains moved closer together. In summary, we argue, that role transitions remained as effortful, with more transitions needed during the day, while the rites helping with role transitioning were reduced. This leads to more resources being needed to transition between roles, maintain boundaries, and with resources being allocated in different domains to respond to the tasks at hand there. This resource draining process should manifest in the perception of the home-office as a place of hindering demands and obstacles.

The other mechanism, resource replenishment, occurs after resources have been spent and need to be restored. The home is being regarded as the primary location for restoration, besides the natural environment. Empirical evidence suggests that the home has a symbolic value to its residents, as being a safe haven, a place of refuge, security, and control, or as a private space, where intrusion from the outside is forbidden. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the forced arrangement of working from home, the work domain intruded into the home space involuntarily. With the risen (boundary) work demands, the evaluation of the home runs the risk of losing the positive evaluation of being a place with high restorative capacity. This could be detrimental to the resource replenishment of individuals since other restorative activities were restricted as well. This could lead to a generally diminished level of resources, which then cannot be used to overcome new demands, thereby reducing the personal feeling of accomplishment and therefore self-efficacy. We argue that separating work and leisure spatially at home could mitigate this negative effect, by creating distinct spaces which are predominantly used for one domain or the other. Thereby a transition between a place of work and a place of leisure is possible and restoration can happen more easily. This should manifest in the perception of the home-office as a place of restoration.

When doing research on telecommuting, one important moderator quickly emerges: the extent of telecommuting or time spent working from home. There are two possible directions of how this moderator could influence the effects hypothesized above: On the one hand, extensive telework could make the presence of a workspace more important, since more time is being spent working at home and there are more possibilities for role transitioning and domain conflict, while low extent telework could make home adjustment obsolete. On the other hand, people who work extensively at home could develop behavioral scripts and other coping mechanisms directed at keeping detrimental effects at bay, therefore buffering the indirect effect of a physical space, while people working from home rather sporadically could lack this behavioral adaptation due to less experience, making a separate workspace more important. Furthermore, a quadratic relationship is conceivable, where working a moderate amount of time at home makes physical adjustment relevant, while high and low telecommuting intensity doesn’t require a separate workspace as urgently because of the reasons outlined above. We explore the effect, teleworking extent has on the mediated relationship between workspace at home and home-office self-efficacy.

We test these associations in a large, longitudinal sample of full-time workers, first as a multilevel mediation across all time points. To better understand the causality of these effects, we then take a subsample of people, who have experienced a change in their work location at home and investigate the subsequent changes in the variables outlined above, using discontinuous growth modeling.",step2,True

From Service to Census: Using the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Longitudinal Study to examine the health and occupational outcomes of UK veterans.,"Study Information
Background
The UK Census, administered by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), is a critical resource helping to guide the apportionment of resources and long-term planning in areas such as healthcare, housing, economic development, and education. The Census has been conducted every ten years since 1801, except for a pause in 1941. While the underlying fundamentals remain consistent, questions have been updated to reflect the needs of an evolving nation. 

Before the 2021 Census, data on prior service in the UK Armed Forces (AF) was not collected. Estimates of the UK veteran population were derived from previous service counts and extrapolation from surveys(1,2). This lack of systematic data collection resulted in limited knowledge of the veteran population as a whole and hindered the evaluation of key social, health, and economic outcomes. In response to the critical need for systematic data collection concerning the veteran population, a question concerning ‘veteran status’ was finally included in the 2021 Census. From the 2021 Census, 1,853,112 individuals aged 16 and older identified as veterans (regular or reserve), representing 3.8% of the population in England and Wales(3).

Enumeration of the veteran population supports the UK Government in abiding by its commitments under the UK Armed Forces Covenant(4) by providing accurate, systematic data on the veteran population.  In the Covenant, the Government acknowledges the profound sacrifices of service members. It asserts its obligation to ensure service members, and their families are not disadvantaged by their service(4). This data helps the government identify and address any disadvantages veterans might face due to their service, ensuring they receive appropriate support in areas like healthcare, housing, and employment. This enhanced data collection allows for better-informed policies and resource allocation, particularly for subgroups of veterans who may be at greater risk of adverse outcomes.

With the 2021 Census, it is now possible to directly compare the health and economic status of veterans and non-veterans. The census data show that many labour force indicators, such as economic activity and unemployment, are generally similar between veterans and non-veterans when matched by age, sex, and region (5). However, some notable differences have emerged, particularly in employment sectors, work patterns, and self-employment rates. Veterans are more likely to work in the public administration and defence sectors, more likely to work over 49 hours per week, and less likely to be self-employed compared to non-veterans (5). In terms of health and disability, veterans reported slightly higher rates of disability and poorer general health (classified as bad or very bad) than non-veterans (5). However, after adjusting for age, sex, region, and ethnicity, these differences were primarily observed among veterans who identified as white or of mixed ethnicity, while other groups showed more comparable health outcomes to non-veterans(5).

It is important to recognize that veterans are not a homogeneous group. Older veterans are predominantly white, while younger veterans are more ethnically diverse, with a higher representation of women.

The availability of nationally representative data on the veteran population allows us to build a robust evidence base to identify subgroups of veterans who may benefit from targeted resources and services. This data also supports strategic planning to meet the short- and long-term needs of the UK veteran population. By examining changes in economic activity, general health, and disability over time, we can better understand the varying experiences of veterans, accounting for differences in pre-service, in-service, and post-service factors that may influence these outcomes

Our project will be the first step in providing an in-depth picture of veterans' health and economic status within England and Wales using a longitudinal linked data from the UK census. For this analysis, we will have priority access to an early release of the ONS Longitudinal Study (LS), which links successive waves of census data for a 1% sample of the Census and is generalisable to the population of England and Wales. We will explore three major outcomes among veterans and examine how these outcomes compare to nonveterans over time: self-reported general health, limiting disability, and economic activity.",step2,True
Welfare quality and immigration,"The upcoming data collection will assemble information regarding two main hypotheses:
1) The first stimulus (long waiting lists for surgery in Swedish healthcare) is expected to decrease willingness to accept refugees. This finding was made in an earlier explorative analysis and the new survey-experiment replicates that study to confirm the hypothesis. Theoretically the argument is that newly arrived refugees in the short run will not increase health care personnel, but they will need health care and hence increase the pressure on existing health care provision.
2) The second stimulus (information of the number of Ukrainian refugees that will arrive in Sweden over the next three months) is according to the same logic expected to increase the downwards pressure on respondents’ perceptions of health care quality. This experiment is new and while the stimulus is strong (the number expected to arrive in 2022 is bigger than in 2015), we are in a turbulent situation where feelings of sympathy for the refugees are very high.",step2,True
Estimating Capacity Utilization from Survey Data,"In this paper, we review the history and concepts behind the Federal Reserve&amp;amp;amp;#x27;s measures of capacity and capacity utilization, summarize the methods used to construct the measures, and describe the principal source data for these measures--the Census Bureau&amp;amp;amp;#x27;s Survey of Plant Capacity. We show that the aggregate manufacturing utilization rate from the Survey of Plant Capacity does not exhibit the &amp;amp;amp;quot;cyclical bias&amp;amp;amp;quot; possessed by utilization rates from the less statistically rigorous utilization rate surveys previously used to estimate the Federal Reserve&amp;amp;amp;#x27;s measures. At the detailed industry level, utilization rates from the Survey of Plant Capacity for several industries do appear to possess a cyclical bias, but we demonstrate that this bias is removed in the construction of the Federal Reserve capacity measures. We further show that the Federal Reserve measures, by combining the Census survey utilization rates with other indicators of capacity, do not discard significant information contained in the Census rates. In fact, the Federal Reserve procedures add to the predictive content of the Census utilization rates in models of capital spending, capacity expansion, and changes in price inflation.",step2,True
A Study On the Determinants of Race and Ethnicity in Trust in Elections,"This registration presents a pre-analysis plan for a study on the determinants of trust in elections by racial and ethnic minorities using messages produced by non-partisan election officials in the United States.

The study will test the effectiveness of messaging produced by election officials with different factors. First, we aim to understand if consistent messaging delivered by messengers of different races is more or less effective at increasing levels of trust among members of minoritized communities. Second, we aim to understand if different messaging delivered by the same election official is more or less effective at increasing levels of trust among members of minoritized communities. The survey will also include a second experiment on poll watchers to test the level of confidence that respondents have in the election based on a hypothetical polling location. The conjoint survey experiment examines the effect of randomly assigned attributes of polling locations to determine what causes a lack of voter confidence, including the implied race (through names) and partisanship of poll watchers. Furthermore, we plan to conduct a regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) to measure “winner effects”: we will gather half of the sample immediately after the election (when we expect that the presidential contest results will be uncertain) and the second half after the Associated Press projects a winner.",step2,True

ECONOMIC CHANGE AND SPECIALIZATION IN INDIA'S CITIES,"Urban areas contribute to nearly two‐thirds of India's gross domestic product, but only constitute 31% of the country's population. In this paper, I address the following questions: What are the specializations of Indian cities and towns, and how have these changed over time; and what part of the specialization identified is a result of local advantages versus industry or national economic growth? Answers to these questions are basic to sustaining the competitiveness of India's cities. I used standard Census of India data at city level to compute location quotients for India's cities and towns, and examined changes in their economic base over time. Further, I performed shift‐share analyses for selected large cities to disaggregate their employment growth. On average, over 1991–2001, specialization in all sectors, with the exception of trade, decreased. I found evidence of persistence in the sectoral specialization of Indian cities during 1991–2001. Further, in all non‐agricultural economic sectors, cities in states know to be backward and lagging are specialized in most sectors. Based on location quotient analyses, I find that Mumbai is the financial capital of the country, Delhi is the seat of public administration, and Bengaluru specializes in transport, storage, and communications.",step2,True

As DFV is the primary reason women and children leave their homes (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2022), it seems imperative that homelessness services are aware of the level of danger posed to women so they can be prioritised for housing and referred to specialist DFV services. Further, homelessness services may interact with DFV perpetrators. Identification of potential perpetrators can dictate the necessity of safety measures implementation.

"Immigrant residential segregation in U.S. metropolitan areas, 1990–2000","AbstractThis paper examines the extent of spatial assimilation among immigrants of different racial and ethnic origins. We use restricted data from the 1990 and 2000 censuses to calculate the levels of dissimilarity by race and Hispanic origin, nativity, and year of entry, and then run multivariate models to examine these relationships. The findings provide broad support for spatial assimilation theory. Foreign-born Hispanics, Asians, and blacks are more segregated from native-born non-Hispanic whites than are the U.S.-born of these groups. The patterns for Hispanics and Asians can be explained by the average characteristics of the foreign-born that are generally associated with higher levels of segregation, such as lower levels of income, English language ability, and homeownership. We also find that immigrants who have been in the United States for longer periods are generally less segregated than new arrivals, and once again, much of this difference can be attributed to the characteristics of immigrants. However, patterns also vary across groups. Levels of segregation are much higher for black immigrants than for Asian, Hispanic, and white immigrants. In addition, because black immigrants are, on average, of higher socioeconomic status than native-born blacks, such characteristics do not help explain their very high levels of segregation.",step2,True
Improving access to digital historical census boundaries in Canada,"Historical census boundary datasets are invaluable resources for mapping and analyzing demographics over space and time. In Canada, finding and using historical census boundary data can be a little difficult. Statistics Canada makes tabular census data available online for the 2011, 2006, 2001, and 1996 Censuses, with some summary profile tables available back to 1991. For boundary files however, fewer censuses are accessible, with only 2011, 2006, and 2001 available online. Today, access to the older collections is typically mediated by Statistics Canada, or academic libraries who have access through the Data Liberation Initiative (DLI) program. Given that the data from these earlier years are not readily available online publically, it prevents researchers from easily accessing and using them. In addition, for some of the older censuses, the digital spatial data are stored in archaic data formats which present challenges for use in modern Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

In the fall of 2015, Scholars Portal and the University of Toronto Map and Data Library embarked on a project to bring together the dispersed collection of digital census geography datasets and make them available online so they can be easily accessed by researchers, students, and the general public. This project makes data and documentation available openly through the Ontario Council of University Libraries (OCUL) Scholars GeoPortal platform (http://geo.scholarsportal.info). In making the collection available online openly and all in one place, these datasets will be shared and reused more effectively, thus reducing barriers and duplication for researchers everywhere.

This paper outlines the current status of census boundary datasets in Canada and then details our work which includes collecting known datasets from a variety of sources, data conversion, composing a comprehensive set of metadata, and providing online access to the collection. We also compiled an extensive inventory of all known boundaries produced in order to keep track of the collection as well as assess any gaps to help plan future digitization projects.

Coverage and Agreement of Administrative Records and 2010 American Community Survey Demographic Data,"The U.S. Census Bureau is researching possible uses of administrative records in decennial census and survey operations. The 2010 Census Match Study and American Community Survey (ACS) Match Study represent recent efforts by the Census Bureau to evaluate the extent to which administrative records provide data on persons and addresses in the 2010 Census and 2010 ACS. The 2010 Census Match Study also examines demographic response data collected in administrative records. Building on this analysis, we match data from the 2010 ACS to federal administrative records and third party data as well as to previous census data and examine administrative records coverage and agreement of ACS age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin responses. We find high levels of coverage and agreement for sex and age responses and variable coverage and agreement across race and Hispanic origin groups.

Individual market underwriting profitability in health insurance,"We analyze the underwriting performance of insurers operating in the individual health insurance market from 2010-2017. Our sample consists of both life and health insurance companies. First, we offer descriptive sample statistics of key financial performance measures in this market. Then, we study the difference in performance pre- and post-2014, which represents the year that state online marketplace exchanges were implemented as part of significant health care reform, namely the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA). Our analysis allows us to test whether health care reform affected insurers operating in this market and in what ways. Our results suggest that underwriting profitability was worse in the post-ACA period: Generally, loss ratios and losses per enrollee were significantly higher in the post-reform time period. On the other hand, insurer administrative expenses were significantly lower post-2014. Furthermore, we show that these effects are not uniform across all insurers in the market.",step2,True

"Economic Growth, Labor Market Segmentation, and Labor Productivity","This chapter examines economic growth, labor market segmentation, informal employment, and labor productivity in Indonesia from 1990-2015. It shows four important facts. First, Indonesia was ever among countries in Southeast Asia with the highest economic growth before the country was severely hit by the Asian financial crisis in 1997/98. In 1999, the country started to recover, and since then, the economy has performed exceptionally well until these days. Second, total employment increased continuously, although as a percentage of total labor force, it tends to decline. Second, total labor productivity also continued to increase. Third, employment is still dominated by the informal sector. This chapter also discusses labor market policy in Indonesia. This chapter concludes that there are many factors that simultaneously determine directly or indirectly the growth of labor productivity, including good macroeconomic management and effective labor market policies.

Participation in the 1990 Decennial Census," Theoretical perspectives on survey participation suggest that survey participation is a form of community involvement, reflecting a sense of civic obligation that also motivates such behavior as voting, serving on juries, and paying taxes. Using data from the Survey of Census Participation (SCP), we investigate this hypothesis with respect to mail response to the 1990 census. We examine such motivating factors as structural and attitudinal measures of alienation as well as more proximal measures of knowledge of and attitudes toward the census and concerns about privacy and confidentiality. We also examine a variety of constraining factors, including literacy, facility with the English language, and available time to complete the form. Using multivariate analysis, we explore the relative effects of these factors on the likelihood of returning the completed census form by mail and discuss the implications of our findings for participation in the census and political participation more generally.

Evaluating Race and Hispanic Origin Responses of Medicaid Participants Using Census Data,"Health and health care disparities associated with race or Hispanic origin are complex and continue to challenge researchers and policy makers. With the intention of improving the measurement and monitoring of these disparities, provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 require states to collect, report and analyze data on demographic characteristics of applicants and participants in Medicaid and other federally supported programs. By linking Medicaid records to 2010 Census, American Community Survey, and Census 2000, this new large-scale study examines and documents the extent to which pre-ACA Medicaid administrative records match self-reported race and Hispanic origin in Census data. Linked records allow comparisons between individuals with matching and non-matching race and Hispanic origin data across several demographic, socioeconomic and neighborhood characteristics, such as age, gender, language proficiency, education and Census tract variables. Identification of the groups most likely to have non-matching and missing race and Hispanic origin data in Medicaid relative to Census data can inform strategies to improve the quality of demographic data collected from Medicaid populations.",step2,True

               Managing response burden is key to ensuring an ongoing and efficient supply of fit-forpurpose data. While statistical organizations use multi-faceted approaches to achieve this, response burden management has become an essential element of the strategy used by the U.S. Census Bureau, Statistics New Zealand, Statistics Canada, and Statistics Netherlands. Working in collaboration with respondents, with internal resources dedicated to provide customized approaches for large respondents and with other stakeholders (constituency representatives, associations, etc.) response burden management endeavors to minimize burden and educate stakeholders on the benefit of official statistics. The role continues to evolve with important initiatives regarding the compilation of burden metrics, improvements to existing tracking tools, and an expanded communication role.",step2,True

Modality-based differences in Statistical Learning: Categorization and production of signals across modalities,"Statistical learning (SL) is a powerful cognitive tool of extracting statistical regularities from sensory input, which enables learners to detect structure in the vast amounts of sensory information they are constantly confronted with. This sensitivity to statistical regularities has been investigated extensively in the field of linguistics, and is postulated to play an important role in the process of language acquisition (Saffran, 2003; Romberg &amp; Saffran, 2010). 

There are two types of SL: one which helps to identify the rules that determine how sequences are formed from a set of discrete building blocks (sequential SL, often investigated in the context of syntax and word segmentation) and one that identifies the discrete building blocks themselves from the distributional regularities of the continuous signal (distributional SL, often investigated in the context of phonology). While sequential SL has been the subject of hundreds of studies in the past two decades (see Santolin &amp; Saffran, 2018, for review) very few studies have examined distributional learning (e.g. Escudero, Benders &amp; Wanrooij, 2011; Maye, Werker &amp; Gerken, 2002; Thiessen, 2011). The current study therefore focuses on distributional SL, with the goals of investigating how learners move from continuously-varying signals to discrete categories, and of shedding light on the modality-sensitive nature of this type of learning. More specifically, we ask:

1.	Is distributional SL a modality-sensitive ability in an individual? 
2.	Is distributional SL a stimulus-sensitive ability in an individual?

Earlier studies point to modality-based differences in sequential SL abilities (see Milne, Wilson &amp; Christiansen 2018 for review). However, it is hard to draw clear conclusions from them with respect to distributional SL for several reasons. First, only a handful of studies compared sequential SL performance across modalities using a within-individuals design (e.g., Siegelman &amp; Frost, 2015). Second, the results of many studies that examined visual and auditory sequential SL in a between-groups design are not in line with one another, suggesting that performance might be affected by specific task designs, stimuli, and/or prior knowledge (e.g. Raviv &amp; Arnon, 2018; Siegelman, Bogaerts, Elazar, Arciuli &amp; Frost, 2018). Finally, and most crucially for the current work, we are unaware of any studies that looked into such modality-based and stimuli-based differences in distributional SL, although distributional patterns are a major component of language learning and pattern detection in general. Taking into account different SL tasks and their corresponding strategies is therefore an important step in evaluating the true nature of SL, and would provide a more complete picture of potential modality-sensitive differences in SL abilities in general.

Our goal is to conduct a within-subject comparison of distributional SL abilities in four experimental conditions, spanning different modalities and stimuli: Auditory-Linguistic condition, Auditory-Non-Linguistic condition, Visual-Temporal condition, and Visual-Spatial condition. This design will allow us to compare participants’ performance between sensory modalities (i.e. auditory versus visual) and between stimulus types within a modality (i.e. linguistic versus non-linguistic stimuli in the auditory domain, and temporal versus spatial stimuli in the visual domain). The choice to contrast distributional learning in these modalities and these types of stimuli was based on previous studies of sequential SL, which showed that there are important differences between the visual and the auditory modality (e.g. Emberson, Conway &amp; Christiansen, 2011), linguistic and non-linguistic auditory stimuli (e.g. Siegelman et al., 2018), and temporal vs. spatial visual stimuli (e.g. Conway &amp; Christiansen, 2009).

The current study will use a recently developed paradigm to examine differences in learning and generalization across modalities, and is the first to test and compare categorization and production in distributions SL in two sensory domains using a within-subjects design. Our findings have important implications for the debate about the domain-generality of SL abilities, and will contribute to a better understanding of the nature of SL in general and distributional SL in particular.  

In brief, each experimental condition will consist of three parts (see Study Design and Figure 2): (1) an exposure phase, (2) a categorization task, and (3) a production task. In phase (1), participants will be exposed to signals from a bimodal distribution that vary in their duration or their height, with each signal being associated with one of two categories. Specifically, short and long signals would correspond to either “dangerous” or “safe” aliens. In phase (2), participants will be exposed to all signals one by one, and for each signal they would need to indicate which category the signal belongs to. In phase (3), participants will be asked to produce representative signals for each category using the computer interface. 

We will measure participants’ performance using multiple measures, and compare these measures across the four experimental conditions to detect potential modality- and stimuli- differences (see Analysis plan). For the categorization task we will measure categorization accuracy, and for the production task  we will measure the deviation from the category mode (i.e., how accurately participants reproduce a representative signal for a given category). We also plan to examine the relation between categorization and production performance to see whether categorization accuracy predicts production behavior across conditions. In other words, is it the case that learners who performed better at the categorization task also produce the categories more accurately? Finally, we are interested in the relations between the different modalities, i.e. whether performance in one modality predicts performance in other modalities.",step2,True
Financial Protection Afforded by Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance," This article provides the first national estimates of actuarial values and out-of-pocket spending from the era of nonrestrictive managed care that began in the late 1990s. Employer plans paid about 84 percent of total medical expense for those with employer-sponsored coverage in 2004, about 1 percent less than in 2000, and high users faced potential out of pocket spending in the thousands of dollars when they received a portion of their care out of network. Since 2004, more employers have offered plans with higher deductibles coupled with employer-funded personal accounts. These arrangements can result in low out of pocket costs for many employees, but high users will face substantially higher costs. Many employers adopting high-deductible plans are not contributing to personal accounts. Those who are concerned about higher out-of-pockets might consider income-related cost sharing, educational efforts to communicate the savings that can result from using in-network providers, and continued availability of managed care options that limit out-of-pocket spending.

 ESG Firms Dataset  (ESGFiDa),"The Environmental, Social and Governance Information Firms Dataset (ESGFiDa) aggregates academic, industry and regulatory literature on ESG data firms, that is commercial actors that are involved in the emerging field of providing Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) data. By doing so, ESGFiDa contributes to a more systematic understanding of the evolving industry of ESG information firms. In addition, ESGFiDa offers a meta-analysis of existing efforts from academic and grey literature to study ESG information firms. ESGFiDa was constructed in a multi-stage data collection process that combined the aggregation of  data from the literature with additional primary data that augment existing observations. Going from left to right, figure 1 (see wiki or download ESGFiDa1.1.xlsx) shows the staged process of compiling the two different but interrelated datasets contained in ESGFiDa. The first dataset covers a meta-analysis of studies on the ESG information industry, while the second dataset provides an aggregation and augmentation of existing data. In addition, the figure introduces the structure of the dataset by directing the reader to the sheet of the xlsx file that contains ESGFiDa, where the observations referred to in the figure can be found. Starting from the left, the purple box illustrates that the first stage of data collection consisted of compiling 21 articles and reports that offer an overview of the ESG industry. These articles and reports were subsequently screened for information regarding the ""size"" of the ESG industry (e.g. proxied by the number of ESG rating agencies or ESG products). Wherever the mentioned estimates on the size of the ESG industry were attributed to another publication, this publication was tracked down and included in the dataset pertaining to the meta-analysis (orange boxes). After data cleaning, 27 estimates of the ESG industry and their attributes were recorded in sheet 3 of ESGFiDa. To compile a consolidated dataset of ESG data firms the 21 initial articles were also screened for lists of the names of ESG data firms and additional data sources mentioned in these initial articles were added (blue boxes). This process resulted in a total of 15 articles that provide names lists or in-text mentions of ESG data firms. Aggregating the mentioned firms resulted in an initial list of 148 potential ESG information firms that are displayed on sheet 4 of ESGFiDa. After screening out 20 firms that do not qualify as ESG information firms (see sheet 4 Exclusion_justification) 128 ESG information firms remain in sheet 5. Features about these 128 observations were, subsequently, retrieved from the previously reviewed academic, industry and regulatory publications  as well as from specialist news and data providers (e.g. Bloomberg, Responsible Investor, company registry websites) company websites (including web archives / wayback machine for defunct or merged companies) and company online information on LinkedIn and Wikipedia.

America's Churning Races: Race and Ethnic Response Changes between Census 2000 and the 2010 Census,"Race and ethnicity responses can change over time and across contexts – a component of population change not usually taken into account. To what extent do race and/or Hispanic origin responses change? Is change more common to/from some race/ethnic groups than others? Does the propensity to change responses vary by characteristics of the individual? To what extent do these changes affect researchers? We use internal Census Bureau data from the 2000 and 2010 censuses in which individuals’ responses have been linked across years. Approximately 9.8 million people (about 6 percent) in our large, non-representative linked data have a different race and/or Hispanic origin response in 2010 than they did in 2000. Several groups experienced considerable fluidity in racial identification: American Indians and Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, and multiple-race response groups, as well as Hispanics when reporting a race. In contrast, race and ethnic responses for single-race non-Hispanic whites, blacks, and Asians were relatively consistent over the decade, as were ethnicity responses by Hispanics. People who change their race and/or Hispanic origin response(s) are doing so in a wide variety of ways, as anticipated by previous research. For example, people’s responses change from multiple races to a single race, from a single race to multiple races, from one single race to another, and some people add or drop a Hispanic response. The inflow of people to each race/Hispanic group is in many cases similar in size to the outflow from the same group, such that cross-sectional data would show a small net change. We find response changes across ages, sexes, regions, and response modes, with variation across groups. Researchers should consider the implications of changing race and Hispanic origin responses when conducting analyses and interpreting results.",step2,True
Global Value Chain Linkages and Employment: Empirical Assessment for India’s Manufacturing Sector," We explore the connection between global value chain linkages and employment outcomes for 17 manufacturing sectors in India utilizing panel long run estimator and short run dynamics for the period 1995–2017. We model this relationship within the production function framework and disentangle two significant outcomes. In the first place, we find that in four varieties of the advancement model, employment and value chain linkages exhibit a long run relationship; that is, they are cointegrated. Second, we find that over the long haul, while forward linkages (DVX), compensation to labourers and industrial economic growth have contributed decidedly to employment in manufacturing sector, while the backward linkages (FVA) have had an unimportant impact. Another striking result in the short run shows that in an emerging economy like India, a rise in forward value chain linkage is directly associated with an increase in relative employment of skilled labour force. We draw significant arrangement suggestions from these findings. ",step2,True
Racial/Ethnic and Economic Segregation and Survival in the United States,"AbstractLife expectancy differences across racial/ethnic and economic groups persist in the U.S., but little is known about the combined effects of racial and income segregation in explaining old age survival across neighborhoods. We operationalized neighborhoods using census tracts, with 65,655 of them nested within 3,015 counties, nested within 49 states. We linked census track life table data for ages 45-74 (n=196,965) from the National Vital Statistics System with 5-year population estimates (2011-2015) stratified by race/ethnicity and income from the American Community Survey. We measured racial/ethnic and income segregation using the Index of Concentration of the Extremes at the census tract level, and the indexes of dissimilarity and exposure at the county level. Using three-level random intercept models, we assessed the direct and contextual relationship between survival at ages 45-74 with racial/ethnic and income segregation. Regardless of racial/ethnic stratification, a high concentration of neighborhood poverty was associated with a lower probability of survival relative to affluent neighborhoods (−4.83%; 95% CI −4.86, −4.79), although the relationship was larger in neighborhoods with high concentration of Blacks (−5.61%; −5.67, −5.54). Black-white county-level unevenness also had the largest negative association in those neighborhoods (−0.26%; −0.32, −0.20). Furthermore, Black isolation was negatively associated with a lower survival probability (−0.21%; −0.29, −0.13), but Hispanic isolation was positively associated (0.23%; 0.16, 0.30). Opposite relationships resulted from Black-White (0.06; −0.01, 0.14) and Hispanic-White (−0.13; −0.21, −0.05) interactions. Finally, high exposure to neighborhood poverty/affluence was associated with lower/higher probability of neighborhood survival, but the associations were the strongest for Blacks.SignificanceRacial/ethnic and income residential segregation have been associated with negative health outcomes and increased risk of mortality in the U.S. We tested the association between residential segregation at different geographic levels with the survival probability at ages 45-74 across rural/urban neighborhoods. Results indicate that the racial/ethnic and income geographic composition of the population are important factors for explaining this relationship. That is, poverty concentration, minority-white unevenness, and exposure to poverty, had detrimental outcomes for all communities, irrespective of their racial/ethnic composition. However, while minority-isolation/-exposure to whites is detrimental/protective for Black communities, the opposite happened in Hispanic communities. Our research provides important insights in understanding the extent to which residential segregation explains survival disparities across neighborhoods based on their race/ethnicity composition.",step2,True
Learning new concepts,"The testing effect, first demonstrated by Roediger and Karpicke (2006), highlights the enhancement of learning through repeated testing compared to restudying materials. Butler and Roediger (2008) found that the benefits of repeated testing are amplified when accompanied by feedback. The R-to-K shift was demonstrated by Conway et al. (1997). Undergraduates completed multiple-choice-question (MCQ) exams, choosing between four answers. They were also asked to indicate how they made each decision by selecting one of four options: ‘Remember’ if they had a clear memory of acquiring that information; ‘Just know’ if they knew an answer was correct but did not recollect acquiring the information; ‘Familiar’ if an item felt more familiar than the alternatives; or ‘Guess’ if they simply guessed. Conway et al. found that ‘Remember’ was the dominant response, suggesting students could recall the episodes in which they acquired that information. However, when students were invited to retake the exam informally 6 months later, ‘Remember’ responses declined and the dominant response was ‘Just know’. Such readily-available, long-term knowledge is the goal for many learners and educators. 

The R-to-K shift illustrates the transition from episodic memories to long-term knowledge, and the testing effect suggests one mechanism via which this transition might be facilitated. This research will combine these procedures. The aim is to investigate whether the R-to-K shift is facilitated by repeated testing and feedback. We will use the procedure developed by Dewhurst et al. (2009). Participants will study a set of rare words and their definitions (e.g., thenar = the ball of muscle at the base of the thumb). These will be presented three times. Participants will then be assigned to one of two conditions. Participants in the repeated study with feedback condition will be shown the definitions together with four words with the correct word highlighted. Participants in the repeated test with feedback condition will be shown the definitions together with four words, select the correct word, and receive feedback on whether their choice was correct. One week later, all participants will be given a recognition test in which they see the definitions, choose the correct response from a choice of four, and then categorise their decision as a Remember, Familiar, Just Know, or Guess response.",step2,True
Re-Investigating the behavioral benefits of cuing participants to learn a new task instruction,"In the previous experiment, we did not find any cue effect, indicating participants did not use the task type cue to prepare for the incoming task information, which is also supported by the survey result at the end of the experiment. In this experiment, we aim to modify the paradigm so that participants are more likely to find the task type cue helpful and use it to prepare for the task. Firstly, we include the motor rule back in the paradigm, which enlarges the whole task space (sixty-four tasks in total). In addition, we extend the training session by adding one more block for each practiced task. By doing so, participants can become more familiar and skilled when they perform the practiced task. To maximally differentiate the practiced tasks from the rest of the novel tasks, we expect that participants will find the task type cue more helpful than before.",step2,True
"Adaptive coding of reward in schizophrenia, its change over time and relationship to apathy","Abstract
               Adaptive coding of reward is the process by which neurons adapt their response to the context of available compensations. Higher rewards lead to a stronger brain response, but the increase of the response depends on the range of available rewards. A steeper increase is observed in a narrow range and a more gradual slope in a wider range. In schizophrenia, adaptive coding appears to be affected in different domains, especially in the reward domain. Here, we tested adaptive coding of reward in a large group of patients with schizophrenia (n = 86) and control subjects (n = 66). We assessed: (i) the association between adaptive coding deficits and symptoms; (ii) the longitudinal stability of deficits (the same task was performed 3 months apart); and (iii) the stability of results between two experimental sites.
               We used functional MRI and the monetary incentive delay task to assess adaptation of participants to two different reward ranges: a narrow range and a wide range. We used a region-of-interest analysis to evaluate adaptation within striatal and visual regions. Patients and control subjects underwent a full demographic and clinical assessment.
               We found reduced adaptive coding in patients, with a decreased slope in the narrow reward range with respect to that of control participants, in striatal but not visual regions. This pattern was observed at both research sites. Upon retesting, patients increased their narrow-range slopes, showing improved adaptive coding, whereas control subjects slightly reduced them. At retesting, patients with overly steep slopes in the narrow range also showed higher levels of negative symptoms.
               Our data confirm deficits in reward adaptation in schizophrenia and reveal an effect of practice in patients, leading to improvement, with steeper slopes upon retesting. However, in some patients, an excessively steep slope may result in poor discriminability of larger rewards, owing to early saturation of the brain response. Together, the loss of precision of reward representation in new (first exposure, underadaptation) and more familiar (retest, overadaptation) situations might contribute to the multiple motivational symptoms in schizophrenia.",step2,True

Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria promote plant size inequality,"AbstractThe uniformity of crop yield is extremely important for consumers and of as much relevance to the grower as overall yield. However, size inequality within a plant population is rarely measured and has never before been considered in relation to the use of beneficial microbes for yield enhancement. For the first time, we show that addition of soil bacteria to calabrese plants significantly increased size inequality. These effects were usually more apparent in above-ground biomass. This was caused by some (but not all) plants growing very large when inoculated with bacteria, while control plants were mostly small. We suggest that the main reason is the incompatibility of the inoculated bacteria with those already present in the rhizosphere. In some cases the inoculum matched the indigenous community, providing a benefit to plant growth, while often it did not and plants remained relatively small. We conclude that analyses of size inequality should be an integral part of experiments using microbial soil amendments. These analyses can help to inform the production of more effective microbial products and to ensure that the integration of beneficial microbes into sustainable production systems does not impair uniformity in yield.",step2,True

"Egohoods that segregate. Immigrants, social contexts, and income penalties","AbstractThis paper looks at the causal impact of residential segregation on income among migrants in Brescia, a wealthy industrial city of about 200,000 inhabitants in North‐Eastern Italy, where almost one citizen out of five is born abroad. Using a new register‐like dataset including economic and demographic microdata from administrative sources, we geo‐localised each migrant household and created for each individual an “egohood” by imposing buffer circles with the same diameter (250 or 500 m) around his or her residential location. Within this spatial area of reference, we calculated indices of ethnic segregation and exposure to Italian natives, thus measuring the individual network of potential contacts with co‐ethnics and with Italians.Following social networks and social capital theories, we expected ethnic segregation to have a negative impact and exposure to natives to have a positive impact on income and tested our hypotheses with a set of ordinary least squares and two‐stage least squares with instrumental variables regression models. Results showed a robust and negative effect of ethnic segregation on income, whereas a small and positive effect of exposure to natives was not robust to endogeneity checks. We also found substantial heterogeneity among migrant groups defined by macroareas of origin: Exposure to Italians was found to have the expected impact only among migrants coming from Eastern Europe and from the Middle East and North Africa.",step2,True

Difficulties of integrating older workers into the labor market: exploring the Israeli labor market,"Purpose– The purpose of this article is to examine the existence of biased stereotypes about older workers. What are the economic implications of such biased stereotypes? Finally, what policy measures are required in order to achieve efficiency in the labor market?Design/methodology/approach– The authors grouped 25 opinions about older workers into three categories of stereotypes. The first category dealt with the productivity of older staff. The other two categories addressed their reliability and adaptability. The authors then questioned 312 Israeli respondents about the degree to which they agreed or disagreed with the opinions. Finally, the authors examined theoretically the economic effects of biased stereotypes about older workers.Findings– The study demonstrates that individual and organizational characteristics affect employers' attitudes. Age was a significant factor in all three categories. The older the respondent, the fewer prejudices he or she had against older workers. Other characteristics such as gender, interaction with older workers, the nature of the respondent's work in the organization, the age of the employees, and the size of the organization were all significant, but not always, and not in all three categories. The findings imply that there are biased stereotypes about older workers, so the allocation of workers is distorted, which leads to a failure of the market.Originality/value– The results strengthen the economic justification for policy intervention to correct the distorted level of employment of older workers in the labor market.",step2,True
Firm characteristics and balanced scorecard usage in Singaporean manufacturing firms,"Purpose– This study aims to examine the effects of balanced scorecard (BSC) usage on performances in the context of four contingent variables in Singaporean manufacturing firms. The results show that firms are more likely to adopt BSC if they are large in size, have products at an early product lifecycle (PLC) stage, operate in highly uncertain environments or adopt differentiation strategies. However, the adoption of BSC improves performance only in firms that are large or have products at an early PLC stage. The results suggest that contingent factors in which a firm operates can exert significant effects on the results of adopting BSC.Design/methodology/approach– Survey data are collected, then the authors check data correlations, principle components analysis, run regression analysis and ANOVA.Findings– BSC use is positively and significantly correlated with PLC stage, external environment and performance. Size and strategy are positively correlated with BSC usage, but are not statistically significant. Higher BSC use is found in large firms with products at an early PLC stage or operating in a highly uncertain environment. Companies with a cost leadership strategy are significantly associated with BSC use.Research limitations/implications– This study has small sample size and uses survey research method. The measurements to capture all aspects of BSC usage are non-exhausting. Future research can use different methodologies, such as field studies, case studies and lab experiments, to examine other industries than manufacturing.Practical implications– The authors results show the positive association between BSC use and certain firm characteristics. Firms with those characteristics should get insights about the benefit of using BSC and extract the maximum benefit from their investment on the BSC use and those firms which don’t have BSC in implication may think of implementing the BSC use.Social implications– Firms’ contingent factors affect the value of adopting BSC. With the authors research result, firms will be aware of how to extract the most value out of BSC and improve the social wealth of the manufacturing industries.Originality/value– The authors paper is the first paper to use survey method to examine the association between BSC and firms’ contingent factors in the Singaporean manufacturing firms setting.",step2,True

Qualitative meta-analysis of client and therapist experiences of teletherapy,"Background. Teletherapy, which has existed since the 1950s (Saul, 1951), involves delivering mental health care remotely via videoconferencing or phone. Initially considered less effective than in-person therapy (Connolly et al., 2020), early studies demonstrated its feasibility, adaptability, and comparable clinical outcomes (Backhaus et al., 2012; Simpson, 2009). However, skepticism among providers slowed its adoption. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a dramatic shift, with teletherapy usage increasing 26-fold in the U.S. (Pierce et al., 2021) and 96% of therapists offering remote services (APA, 2021). This shift served as a “natural experiment” to evaluate its effectiveness, revealing that therapists were positively surprised by its efficacy (Békés &amp; Aafjes-van Doorn, 2020), and stronger online therapeutic relationships correlated with greater acceptance and future use (Békés, Aafjes-van Doorn, Zilcha-Mano, et al., 2021). Patients, who already viewed teletherapy more favorably than therapists pre-pandemic, also reported reasonably high satisfaction (Békés, Aafjes-van Doorn, 2022, 2023). Research has also shown that teletherapy is as effective as in-person therapy, with comparable treatment outcomes and therapeutic alliance ratings (Norwood et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2021; Seuling et al., 2023). However, qualitative studies also reported on the differences in therapeutic process and the therapeutic relationship between in-person and teletherapy, as described by both clients and therapists. Many of these qualitative studies were conducted in the context of the rapid transition to teletherapy during the pandemic, which allowed for the exploration of first experiences with teletherapy, often in comparison with previous in-person therapy experiences. 
Even though teletherapy became commonplace by today, we still know very little about the subjective experiences of clients and therapists when it comes to teletherapy. The studies in the field mostly explore small samples under specific circumstances, and typically include either client of therapist samples. The present qualitative meta-analysis attempts to synthetize the findings regarding clients’ and therapists’ experiences with teletherapy so far, and specifically, answer the following research questions:
1) How do clients and therapists experience teletherapy?
2) How is this experience different from their experience with in-person therapy?
3) What are seen as advantages and disadvantages of teletherapy by clients and therapists?
4) What are potential differences between client and therapist experiences with teletherapy?

Methods. We will investigate the research questions by using a qualitative meta-analysis as described by Timulak (2009). PRISMA 2020 guidelines (Page et al., 2021) will guide the search process. We will register the review with PROSPERO, ensuring transparency.
To identify primary studies, a systematic search will be conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, using search terms: (a) patient*/ client*/clinician*/therapist*/psychotherapist*/counselor*/counsellor* (b) view*/experience*/attitude*/perspective/report*/accept*/ perception/satisfaction, and (c) telepsychotherapy/teletherapy/online counseling/ remote therapy/virtual therapy/online therapy/e-therapy/web-based counseling/digital therapy/video therapy/cybertherapy/internet therapy, with relevant research design (qualitative/mixed method).
Studies that meet the following criteria will be included: (i) studies that report on clients’ or therapists’ experiences, views, and perceptions of teletherapy (ii) studies that reports on clients who have received, or therapists who provided teletherapy (iii) qualitative studies reporting on quantitative data such as interviews or focus groups. We will exclude studies that only report on a) interventions that did not include a live therapist-client interaction, such as internet-based programs or mental health apps; (b) interventions that were not conducted via video, for example only using phone, text, or email; (c) Non-English studies, reviews, commentaries, or theoretical papers without original data will also be excluded from our review. 
Two authors will independently conduct the systematic search procedures (study screening, study identification, data extraction &amp; quality analyses). Quality assessment of the included studies will be conducted using the CASP Qualitative Studies Checklist (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme, 2018). We will extract data, including key findings, themes, and any relevant information, including quotes from the selected studies, which will be analyzed and synthetized, identifying core themes and patterns across the studies.

Importance. This study will be the first to synthetize clients’ and therapists’ lived experiences with teletherapy, and also the first to compare client and therapist experiences using qualitative meta-analysis. Understanding how both parties perceive teletherapy, and how it differs from in-person therapy, can inform best practices, improve the quality of teletherapy sessions, and guide future training for mental health professionals. It can also highlight potential barriers and factors that contribute to a better experience of teletherapy, allowing for better teletherapy support and tailored interventions.",step2,True
Internal Migration of the Foreign-Born in Canada," This article uses the Public Use Sample file of the 1986 Canadian census to characterize and explain the interprovincial migration patterns of the foreign-born in Canada. Simple overall in- and outmigration rates are calculated for the foreign-born and compared to the interprovincial migration rates for Canadian-born migrants, specifically primary, return and onward migrants. A two-level nested logit model is then applied for foreign-born migrants age 20–64 to study the effects of personal factors and provincial attributes on their interprovincial migration patterns. The foreign-born have higher in- and outmigration rates than primary migrants, with Ontario having a strong ability to attract and retain the foreign-born. Despite these differences, the foreign-born respond to economic variables in a rational way and relatively little of the migration decision process can be explained by place-of-birth effects. Selectivity with respect to personal factors (i.e., education, age, sex, family type) is similar to the Canadian-born. ",step2,True
Population Trends From The North American Breeding Bird Survey,"Abstract
               Most Neotropical migrant birds are difficult to count accurately and are moderately common over large breeding distributions. Consequently, little historical information exists on their large-scale population changes, and most of this information is anecdotal. Surveys begun in this century such as Breeding Bird Censuses and Christmas Bird Counts have the potential to provide this information, but only the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) achieves the extensive continental coverage necessary to document population changes for most Neotropical migrant birds. Conservationists and ecologists have begun to use BBS data to estimate population trends, but there is still widespread confusion over exactly what these data show regarding population changes. In this chapter, we review the current state of knowledge regarding population changes in Neotropical migrant birds and the methods used to analyze these changes. The primary emphasis is on the BBS (Robbins et al. 1986) because this survey provides the best available data for estimating trends of Neotropical migrants on a continental scale. To address questions about methods of analyzing survey data, we review and compare some alternative methods of analyzing BBS data. We also discuss the effective ness of the BBS in sampling Neotropical migrant species, and review possibilities for use of alternative data sets to verify trends from the BBS.",step2,True
Controlling the American Community Survey to intercensal population estimates," The US Census Bureau has proposed the use of demographic projections as population controls for the American Community Survey at a fine level of geographic and demographic stratification. These projections are known to be imperfect. Bias and variance of post-stratification estimators with imperfect population controls at various levels of aggregation are considered. The bias and variance are computed with respect to the ""model"" (including data generation and demographic projection) or with respect to the ""design"" (including coverage, sampling, response and demographic projection). Bias and variance depend in a complex way on the interactions of demographic projection errors with undercoverage error and nonresponse. Numerical examples illustrate that in the presence of imperfect demographic projections, control at higher levels of aggregation may be better in terms of bias than control at a fine level of post-stratification.

Universal Pre-Kindergarten,"Abstract
               At the turn of the twenty-first century, public universal pre-kindergarten (UPK) gained momentum across the United States as a widely popular public policy goal. More recently, however, implementing high-quality UPK has been hampered by federal disengagement from the issue, fiscal constraints, and conflicting state policy approaches. This chapter examines the growth of UPK as an important policy goal on the federal and state levels; the impact of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) and a new presidential administration on federal policy disengagement from the issue; and varying degrees of state fiscal support and state and local policy approaches in thwarting the full realization of UPK’s promise. This examination notes the urgent need for a policy focus on the equitable delivery of high-quality programs if UPK is to improve future educational outcomes and help close opportunity gaps. Universal access will not achieve pre-kindergarten’s benefits without high-quality programming. If universal pre-kindergarten’s promise is to be achieved, the federal and state governments must work in tandem to ensure that all children, starting with those most in need of early education, have access to high-quality, age-appropriate UPK. Because ESSA limits federal policy prescriptions, advocacy must focus on the state level, using evidence-based lessons from research and experience.",step2,True
Head Start Children’s Multiple Care Experiences,"Care multiplicity, defined here as more than one concurrent early childhood education (ECE) experience, is common among children attending Head Start (HS). Yet, we know little about who experiences it nor what effects such experiences have for children’s school performance. Understanding HS children’s utilization of other publicly-funded center-based ECE programs has particular policy relevance given the capacity of such information to inform systematic collaboration and coordination to improve outcomes. 

For over three decades Iowa has invested in coordinated early childhood services, including universal state-funded preschool, a comprehensive two-generation program for low-income families, and an integrated data system (IDS) designed to use administrative data in a systematic approach for social problem solving and continuous quality improvement through data-driven decision-making. Capitalizing on these investments, this study will integrate and/or merge sets of state-level administrative data: (1) 16 to 17 enrollment and attendance datasets from Iowa’s 18 HS grantees (16 dataset received and 1 pending); (2) Vital Statistics birth records from the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH); (3) preschool enrollment, kindergarten and grade 1 school records from the Iowa Department of Education (IDE); (4) Child Care Assistant (CCA) records from the Iowa Department of Health Services (IDHS); (5) Teaching Strategies GOLD preschool assessments from the IDE; and (6) Head Start Program Collaboration Survey data from the Iowa HS State Collaboration Office.

Using integrated data, this study will provide the following information about Iowa’s children who attended HS: (1) patterns of care multiplicity; (2) child and family characteristics relating to care multiplicity experiences; (3) effects of care multiplicity on children’s school performance (risk vs. on-target status) at kindergarten and first grade; and (4) the role of program partnership between HS and co-serving ECE programs on school performance.
Our analytical sample differ for each research question (RQ). Our study sample for RQ 1 will represent children who attended HS a year prior to kindergarten in 2016-17 or 2017-18 (SY 2017 and 2018; N expected = 5,408 or more). RQ 2 will include children who were born in Iowa and attended HS a year prior to be kindergarten eligible SY 2017 and 2018 (N expected = 4,204 or more). RQs 3 and 4 will represent children who were born in Iowa, attended HS the year prior to kindergarten and attended kindergarten in Iowa in SY 2017 and 2018 (N expected =  3,750 or more). Analytic approaches include basic descriptive statistics as well as logistic regression and propensity score analysis to address selection bias in ECE programs.",step2,True

Political Architecture: Do Style and Neighborhood Fit Impact Housing Politics?,"Urban America is facing a housing affordability crisis. Residents of nearly all the nation’s largest cities spend an increasing share of their incomes on housing costs. Housing unaffordability is associated with a number of deleterious consequences, such as eviction, homelessness, and a lack of access to some of the nation’s most productive and highest opportunity cities (O’Flaherty, 2004; Lee, Tyler, and Wright, 2010; Chetty, Hendren, and Katz, 2016; Colburn and Aldern, 2022).

Economists have shown that the root cause of the housing affordability crisis is not enough housing (Glaeser, Gyourko and Ward 2009; Gyourko, Hartley, and Krimmel, 2021; Been, Ellen, and O’Regan, 2019). To address the problem, more multi-family housing is essential (Been, Ellen, and O’Regan, 2023). One of main culprits of slow housing production is local opposition by residents opposed to development, who often effectively veto construction of multifamily housing (Einstein, Glick, and Palmer, 2018; Einstein, Glick, and Palmer, 2019). 

In this study, we focus on explaining public opinion about multi-family housing. This is the type of housing most effective at increasing the supply of affordable housing and potentially reducing inequality, yet it elicits significant public opposition. The literature on opposition to housing development has examined many potential explanations: threats to property values, increased congestion of public goods, or racial exclusion. However, little attention has been devoted to a factor familiar to urban planners: the fit between the style and size of new housing and the existing neighborhood (Fischel, 2005; Banzhaf, 2013; Shertzer, Twinam, and Walsh, 2016; Krimmel, 2021; Marble and Nall, 2021; Trounstine, 2023). Concerns about fit and aesthetics come up frequently in comments at public meetings and in online reader comments about news articles (Einstein, Glick, and Palmer, 2018). Yet these concerns have not received much attention in the political science literature. 

Our original survey aims to uncover whether style and neighborhood fit meaningfully affect development preferences and actions that express them: intention to attend meetings or vote in local elections. Opposition to multifamily housing is often exercised at local zoning meetings and through local elections (Einstein. Glick, and Palmer 2018). We examine people’s views and how motivated they are to act on them. 

We define a building as a fit if it matches the surrounding neighborhood style and the height of adjacent buildings (See Appendix; our pre-selected neighborhoods were chosen to have relatively uniform heights and styles of nearby buildings). Our sample includes respondents (renters and homeowners) from the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the US (excluding low-density exurbs), as these represent the cities most affected by the affordability crisis (for similar strategies, see Marble and Nall, 2021; Nall, Elmendorf, and Oklobdzija, 2024). We show respondents images of proposed developments, which vary in style and fit with pre-specified neighborhood contexts. We randomize the style and fit while keeping other factors found to matter in the literature fixed, such as parking, tenure (if units are rentals for renters or condos for homeowners), and developer contributions. Each respondent will receive all these combinations of buildings and neighborhoods in randomized order. We contrast opposition to the proposed development in each of these neighborhood contexts against an experimental control group asked to rate the identical buildings devoid of neighborhood context. (See Appendix Figure 2). This contrast isolates the effect of fit with the neighborhood.  

Using images has several advantages. First, it is externally valid, because such renderings are often shown at local meetings. Second, this visual approach improves the measurement of development preferences (Jansen et al., 2009). Prior studies are typically text only, leaving it to respondents to imagine what these buildings look like or where they may be sited, which may introduce noise into the measures. We test this against an experimental pure control group receiving text-only descriptions. (See Appendix Figure 2).

We also aim to improve the measurement of alternative explanations such as affordability, whose measurement difficulties may have limited prior studies, by more precisely and comprehensively defining rent levels and income levels tied to each respondent’s area median income. This paper contributes to the literature on housing by centering principles of urban planning and design. We hypothesize that the fit of proposed buildings into the existing neighborhoods and building styles matter, with buildings that do not fit and those with more modern styles eliciting more opposition. Neighborhood fit and style may help explain why land-use regulations are often “sticky” even when projects satisfy major concerns such as parking or affordability to middle incomes, and why any given new housing project is often met with resistance – even as many Americans support housing development in the abstract.",step2,True
Spillovers,"Economists since Demsetz have viewed property rights as a way to
internalize the external costs and benefits one party's action confers on
another. They have thought this internalization desirable, reasoning that
if a party didn't capture the full social value of her actions she wouldn't
have optimal incentives to engage in those actions. Measured by this
standard, IP rights are inefficiently weak. There is abundant evidence that
the social value of innovations far exceeds the private value. But there is
also good evidence that, contrary to what economists might assume, these
spillovers actually encourage greater innovation. The result is a puzzle
for Demsetzians.

In this article, we offer three insights that help to explain the positive
role of innovation spillovers. First, we note that in IP, unlike real
property, a wide range of externalities matter, because IP rights are much
less certain than property rights, and because the decision to create a
legal entitlement will determine whether or not a transaction must occur.
Second, we make the point that while society needs some ex ante incentive
to innovate, it doesn't need (and doesn't particularly want) full
internalization of the benefits of an invention. Third, we observe that
even where internalizing externalities is desirable, property rights do not
in fact do so perfectly, and they create problematic distortions in
circumstances in which the buyer in a transaction makes productive reuse of
the work. The result of combining these insights is that at least where
innovation is concerned, we cannot rely on the easy equation of property
rights with efficient internalization of externalities.",step2,True
Mandatory Disclosure Rules – Selected Problems,"The article deals with issues related to the introduction of provisions concerning mandatory disclosure and tax reporting rules (MDR) in the Polish legal system. Due to the multifaceted nature and level of complexity of these new regulations, the article focuses on those aspects that are most relevant for activities carried out on the insurance market.
Contrary to the common understanding of the concept of a tax scheme, reporting obligations under the MDR include transactions and operations related to tax optimization as well as standard advice or activity, as long as they meet statutory conditions. In addition, the scope of entities responsible for the implementation of the MDR is wide. Apart from the entity that ""uses"" the scheme, the reporting duties can apply to almost everyone who is professionally involved in the scheme's development, organization, or implementation.
The first months of the new regulations have shown that interpretation and application are not only time-consuming, but more importantly, burdened with significant risks. Their sources include, firstly, the extremely vague and complicated provisions themselves, and, secondly, the practical considerations related to the possibility of the misinterpretation of facts or of defective assessments in situations where participants have limited knowledge or experience. These risks are of key importance due to the fact that the incorrect application of the MDR regulations can result in penal fiscal sanctions for those responsible for their implementation.

"Innovation, publicity, and change in literary culture","# Pre-registration for “Innovation, Publicity, and Change in Literary Culture”

Because book reviews are richly recorded in published indexes, scholars of literary history have an unusual opportunity to compare literature’s textual history (in the books themselves) to its social history (who talked about those books, what they said, how widely it circulated). We plan to use this opportunity to study the rewards for innovation, and the way those rewards are related to change across relatively long spans of time (roughly 80 years).

## Data

**Textual data:** We’ll take a random sample of English-language fiction from HathiTrust Digital Library, from 1890 to 2000, keeping the number of volumes per decade constant. We’ll form a model of 300 topics (basing this number on a previous experiment by Underwood, Kiley, Shang, and Vaisey). For volumes not present in this sample, we can extrapolate topic proportions using a topic inferencer created by MALLET.

**Review data:** We have extracted metadata about book reviews, and excerpts of the reviews, from the _Book Review Digest,_ 1917-1950. We also have reviews from _Kirkus,_ and metadata about reviews in little magazines from the _Comprehensive Index to English-Language Little Magazines._

**Other reception data:** We have lists of bestsellers, and Pulitzer-prize winning authors, and a retrospective representation of “the avant-garde” constructed using recent secondary sources.

Together, these sources about reception will allow us to study reception in ten different ways.

1. Books that got the most reviews.
2. Books about which most was written (adding up the length of each review).
3. Books more _positively_ reviewed, measured with the +/- codes included in the BRD, supplemented by a sentiment model trained on those +/- codes and used for reviews that are lacking a code.
4. Books reviewed by specific publications (we can itemize, say, 10 leading publications in the _BRD_).
5. Books widely reviewed by little magazines; this is one way of defining an ""avant garde.""
6. Books published by particularly prestigious publishers (e.g., Knopf).
7. Books that won Pulitzer/Nobel prizes.
8. Bestsellers (the top 10 per year from Unsworth’s list).
9. We can use principal component analysis on the whole reception matrix, and then “rotate” the components to find one that tends to distinguish wide-circulation venues (like newspapers) from little magazines. This is another way of defining “avant garde,” and arguably better than the absolute count in (5) at identifying books that get relatively _more_ attention in intellectual venues than in mass-market ones.
10. A retrospective definition of the early-20c avant-garde extracted from recent 21c secondary sources by David Bishop and Liza Senatorova.

## Questions to pose

**A. Analyzing the review data on its own.** Before we even look at the texts of books, it’s reasonable to ask whether these different measures of reception are positively related to each other. Are best-selling (8) and prize-winning (7) books also written about a lot (2) or written about positively (3)?

And do the _evaluative judgments_ of different reviewing venues tend to correlate positively with each other?

Broadly, we do expect positive correlation, with the possible exception that our measure (9)—which will be defined by contrasting small-circulation venues to wide-circulation ones—may not correlate positively with the total volume of review discourse (2). Also there may be pairs of venues whose judgments do correlate negatively.

**B. Measuring novelty and precocity in the texts of books:** The measure of “novelty” in Barron et al. (2018) provides a simple way to measure innovation (as, say, KL divergence from the topic distributions of books in the last 25 years). We propose to use a 25-year window because Underwood and So (2020) found empirically, looking at a different collection of primarily nineteenth-century fiction, that patterns of this kind are legible within a window of 20 to 25 years.

We’ll similarly measure “transience” as KL divergence from the topic distributions of books in the next 25 years.

Precocity is novelty minus transience.

**Handling the generic heterogeneity of literary culture.** We know from previous experience that fiction is divided into genres with a lot of internal similarity. If we measure innovation and transience by looking at average similarity to the whole corpus, the books likely to have most “precocity” (forward shift on the timeline) could simply be books in genres that are growing. By definition, there will be more of those books in the future than the past.

But—at least arguably—this isn’t what most people mean by literary innovation. A book that introduces a new technique or theme to the mystery genre might be said to resemble the future even if the mystery genre as a whole is shrinking. Its innovation *relative to its genre* could be seen as more important than the fortunes of the genre as a whole. There is thus a strong argument for calculating innovation and transience within genres.

The challenge in doing this is that we don’t have genre tags for all books, and even if we did, it would be extremely difficult to reason about them across significant spans of time. Genres mutate, split, and fuse, and people have different perceptions about genre at different points in time. Asking whether China Miéville is in “the same genre” as JRR Tolkien would prejudge some of the questions about innovation and change we’re trying to answer. For that matter, we don’t know that works only influence works within the boundaries of a single genre.

The solution we’ll advance is to compare each book only to the 5% of volumes that most closely resemble it in any given year. This selection of volumes won’t necessarily coincide with the boundaries of a genre as defined by human readers. (Genres can be much smaller than 5% of the market.) But comparing to the closest 5% is a reasonable way of measuring the innovation, or durability, of a work *relative to other works that could conceivably be seen as its precedents or inheritors*.

This solution was tested experimentally in Underwood and So 2020. In practice, measuring novelty and transience this way produces effects that are usually in the same direction as, and fairly close to, effects measured relative to all volumes. But since there is a theoretical justification for the more-tightly-focused measure, and it is arguably less vulnerable to noisy outliers, we will rely primarily on that. We will still, however, measure and discuss precocity measured with relation to the whole dataset; that's a distinct measure with its own kind of significance.

Finally, we’ll normalize measurements of novelty and precocity by converting them into z-scores relative to other books in a five-year moving window. We do this because these measurements can conceivably fluctuate across the timeline for a variety of reasons—ranging from real historical change to artefacts of processing. In this experiment we’re not asking whether the pace of innovation has changed across time; we’re asking which books were novel or durably innovative for their time. Normalizing relative to the immediate environment seems like a principled move, and it’s one that seemed to reduce distortion in Underwood and So 2020.

**B1. Reception variables that correlate with novelty:** Equipped with these measures, we can ask which of the ten social locations itemized above tend to reward innovation. In other words, if we sort books using the total length of their reviews (in 2) or their tendency to be reviewed more in little magazines (in 9), which of those factors correlates most strongly with the novelty score we inferred from the book’s text? (We'll use Spearman correlation because we don't know the pattern will be linear.)

Some of the reception variables we’re considering are binary (a book either is a bestseller or is not). Some of them are continuous (_how_ positively was a book reviewed?) But we can compare all the variables’ association with novelty by converting different measurements of effect size to Cohen’s _d._ We’ll focus on six measures of reception that are well attested and very different from each other: measures 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, and 10 above.

Each of the five of us ranked these variables by expected strength of association with novelty:

David: 9, 3, 2, 7, 8, 10

Liza: 10, 9, 7, 2, 8, 3

Ted: 9, 10, 8, 2, 7, 3

Wenyi: 10, 9, 2, 7, 3, 8

Yuerong: 10, 9, 8, 7, 2, 3

Averaging the rankings we get     	

| reception variable     |  avg rank   | rank after averaging|
|------------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 9: disproportionately in lit. mag.   |	0.6	  |		0   |
| 10: later seen as avant-garde  |	1.2		|	1   |
| 2: most written-about |	2.8		| 	2    |
| 7: prizewinners	|		3.0	|	3   |
| 8: bestsellers	|			3.4	   |		4   |
| 3: most positively reviewed	|	4.0	|	5 |

Our predictions cluster pretty strongly. Kendall’s W is .50 and the mean Spearman correlation between individual rankers and the average is .76.

Whether the actual ranking is similar to this or quite different, our pre-registered prediction give us a way to discuss aspects of the ranking that diverge from expectation. We won’t of course be able to get a _p_ value for that; the number of observations is too small.

**B2. How do rewards vary with a work’s *degree* of innovation?**

We can also infer a reward curve, like the one in Silver, Childress, et al (2022). For instance, what is the relation between innovation and the amount a book gets discussed (measured as total number of words mentioned in the _BRD_.)

It’s straightforward to predict that we will get the inverted U observed by other researchers. Very conventional or very eccentric books are probably discussed less than ones in the middle range.

Because Shang has extracted contemporary genre categories from the BRD, we can also plot a reward curve specifically for “mystery and detective fiction” or “historical fiction.” [Across the 30-odd year span of a single reference book, genre instability doesn’t pose the same problems we would experience if we tried to apply stable genre categories across the full 100-year span of our topic model.]

**B3. Transience.** We will graph innovation versus transience. Here, we expect the linear relationship observed by Barron et al (2018). On average, radical innovations tend not to persist (although there are important exceptions).

**B4. Reception variables that correlate with precocity.** We can also pose questions about _durable_ change. Since innovations tend to be transient, innovation is not at all the same thing as durable change. But if we subtract difference from the future from difference from the past, we can get a measure of a book’s durable innovation. To put it another way, this is a measure of overall displacement on the timeline: how much _more_ a book resembles the future than the past. We call this “precocity.”

Each of the five of us ranked the same six reception variables discussed above by expected strength of association with precocity (again this will be measured as Cohen’s _d_.)

David: 8, 7, 2, 10, 9, 3 

Liza: 7, 10, 8, 2 9, 3

Ted: 2, 10, 8, 7, 9, 3

Wenyi: 10, 7, 3, 2, 8, 9

Yuerong: 9, 8, 10, 7, 2, 3

Averaging the rankings we get     	

| reception variable     |  avg rank   | rank after averaging|
|------------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 10: later seen as avant-garde	   | 1.4	|		0    |
| 7: prizewinners		|	1.6	  |		1  |
| 8: bestsellers		|		1.8		|	2   |
| 2: most written-about|	2.4		|	3    |
| 9: disproportionately in lit. mag.  |	3.4	  |		4  |
| 3: most positively reviewed	|	4.4		|	5  |

In general, the little magazine favorites move down here, and prizewinners &amp; bestsellers move up. Discussion in our lab meeting suggested that bestsellers were expected to be influential almost by definition: there are a lot of copies in circulation.

Clustering is less strong; Kendall’s W is 0.4 and the mean Spearman correlation with the average is 0.68. We can use those measures to ask whether the results we actually get fall within, or exceed, our typical divergence from each other.

Interpreting precocity is tricky. It could tell us which venues of reception were best at _identifying_ incipient directions of change—or, possibly, which venues exerted most _influence_ on literary culture. Since our evidence is observational, it will be hard to separate those possibilities. But measurement of precocity is in any case analogous to Granger causation or predictive power. With a fairly simple transformation (adding up all the books reviewed in a particular venue) we could actually measure Granger causation if we wanted to — and we will.

**B5. Fifth question, about the relation between venues that reward innovation and those that predict precocity:** Are the venues of reception that tend to reward innovation also the venues that tend to predict directions of durable change? These patterns should correlate at least a little, since precocity is just novelty minus transience. But how much will they correlate? 

Our prediction is implicit in our preregistered answers to the two questions above. Spearman correlation between our average rankings for novelty and precocity is 0.31.

We could also graph different magazines and newspapers on a scatterplot where the vertical axis is relation to novelty and the horizontal axis relation to transience. The four quadrants of this graph would be

ahead of the times			innovative but faddish

predictable but durable                     behind the times      

**B6. Final question: are books _far_ ahead of their time rewarded by attention _at_ the time?**

We expect that yes, overall, most reception variables will correlate positively with precocity. But it’s not clear whether this will apply to extreme examples.

Does “precocity” relate to the total reviewing word-count (2) or review sentiment (3) with the inverted U-shaped curve found in Silver et al 2022? Or is it a more straightforward ascending line?",step2,True
Black and Hispanic Representation in Policing: Organizational and Local Labor Market Context,"Recent events, such as highly visible police shootings, have highlighted the underrepresentation of racial minorities in U.S. policing. Past research has found a strong relationship between the local concentrations of a racial minority group and increased representation among police, as well as evidence of the disparate treatment of Blacks and Hispanics by White police officers. Using confidential, establishment-level public employment data on police departments from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, linked to Census local labor market data, we examine how department size and local demographic dynamics are associated with Black/Hispanic underrepresentation in policing. We find that police departments in labor markets with larger Black and Hispanic populations, and those with a greater number of officers on their force, are more likely to report underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic officers relative to the labor market. However, the effect of local population composition is reduced for bigger departments, suggesting a positive effect of organization visibility on minority police integration. In addition, the presence of Blacks and Hispanics in top leadership positions is positively associated with proportional representation, suggesting that minorities in leadership positions may have a beneficial impact on Black and Hispanic officer hiring.",step2,True

1.	Anxiety Gad-7

The generalized anxiety disorder scale consists of 7 questions scoring between 0 and 3, therefore, the minimum and maximum possible scores are 0 and 21 respectively. To evaluate the results obtained when answering the questionnaire, the authors suggest the following scores, and consultation with a health professional is recommended when obtaining a score of 10 or higher:
Psychometric properties:
For the Spanish version, a cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.93 was obtained. Taking into account the cut of 10 points, sensitivity values of 86.8% and specificity of 93.4% were found (Garcia et al, 2010). In the original version the internal consistency of the Gad-7 was excellent (cronbach = .92). Test-retest reliability was also good (intraclass correlation = 0.83). Comparison of the scores derived from the self-report scales with those derived from the versions administered by mhp from the same scales yielded similar results (intraclass correlation = 0.83), indicating good procedure validity (Spitzer et al. 2006).

2.	Behaviors and perceptions (psychological responses to Covid-19)

2.1.	 Behaviors
	Participants will be asked three questions about recent avoidance behaviors (avoiding eating out, avoiding public transportation, and reducing visits to public places) and three more about recommended behaviors (reprogramming the travel plan, increasing surface cleanliness, and maintain better indoor ventilation) in response to the outbreak. All questions were asked as ""during the past week, have you ever ... Due to the new coronavirus outbreak."" The possible answers for each question were yes or no.
Three sets of questions were asked to collect information on preventive behaviors on the typical days before March 6, 2020, when an unknown SARS-related outbreak of pneumonia was first reported, later identified as SARS cov-2 i, and then in the last week. The first two sets of questions regarding the frequency of wearing a face mask when leaving and the frequency of hand washing immediately upon returning home. The response options are scored never (such as 0), rare (1), sometimes (2), generally (3), always (4), or did not come out (5). The main reasons for using a face mask on the usual days and in the last week will be collected. The third set of questions on the duration of handwashing with five categories of answers from short to long (1 to 5), for less than 10 seconds, 10-19 seconds, 20-39 seconds, 40-59 seconds or 60 seconds and more, respectively.
Respondents whose responses for behaviors in the last week obtained higher scores than those of the usual days were categorized as greater frequency or duration of the aforementioned behaviors.
To capture the possible overreaction from the public, a follow-up question will be asked: ""In the past week, have you ever bought or tried to buy glasses for the purpose of protecting yourself against SARS-cov-2 infection?"" with two possible answers (yes or no).
Baijam (2015), refers that encouraging the public to adopt specific hygiene-related behaviors has proven to be useful to contain previous outbreaks of infectious diseases. Motivating the public to adopt such behaviors can be difficult. Studies of how people responded to the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2002 suggest that perceptions or beliefs about an outbreak may be important in determining compliance with official advice. In particular, the literature on severe acute respiratory syndrome suggests that people may be more likely to comply with health-related recommendations if they believe that the recommended behaviors are effective, perceive a high probability that they may be affected by the outbreak, They perceive the disease as having serious consequences, they believe the disease is difficult to treat, and they believe that the government is providing clear and sufficient information about the outbreak and can be trusted to control the spread of the infection. Additionally, higher levels of anxiety or worry may be associated with increased behavioral changes.
Lau (2010), conducted a study to investigate community behavioral and emotional responses in the early phase after the identification of the first few cases of H1N1 in Hong Kong. Some other studies have investigated community attitude and behavior responses to the early phase of the H1N1 pandemic in countries such as the United States, Australia, Malaysia, and Europe, France, Japan. Avoidance behaviors have been frequent in several countries or cities, such as Hong Kong and Malaysia, but not in the United States. Mild emotional distress was noted in Hong Kong, but the public in Japan felt overwhelming fear. Most respondents to the Hong Kong study washed their hands more frequently than usual, but only about 30% of those in the United States did the same. Variations in perceived susceptibility and perceived efficacy over preventive measures have also been reported in these studies. Therefore, community responses to the H1N1 pandemic are likely to be country-specific, possibly determined by previous experiences with epidemics such as SARS, but which serve as the basis for formulating such studies on COVID-19, of use in the health system, risk communication patterns and even culture. The importance of this type of research is that it allows us to develop accessible protocols that are not disruptive to human behavior, that are based on the variability of human nature and that allow us to effectively manage the disappearance of infectious outbreaks

2.2.	Perception 

Five items will be used to assess whether participants believe that certain measures would reduce their risk of contracting covid-19, and the possible response options would be Ineffective (Not effective) (1), Considerable (Not effective) (2) and Effective (Effective) ) (3). The first three items (washing hands frequently, wearing a face mask, and avoiding going out) were consistent with the government-run ad campaign. The last two items (washing your mouth with salt water and taking vitamin C or a product of traditional medicine) were considered as misinformation by medical experts. Participants must respond that the first three items were effective and that the last two items were ineffective and classified as having the correct perceived efficacy of the behaviors.
Four items evaluated the perceived threats of the new coronavirus. Participants are asked ""How likely do you think you will get a new coronavirus infection in the next month""? With five responses from very unlikely (1) to very likely (5), and ""how serious do you think the new coronavirus infection would be if you contracted it"" with five options, from very mild (1) to very severe (5). Participants were also required to report relative transmissibility and severity compared to SARS in 2003, with five response categories of much lower (1), lower (2), similar (3), higher (4 ), much higher (5).
Three items assess how well informed the public is. Participants are asked ""if you received and read the informational brochure on the new coronavirus from the government and medical experts"" with two response options (yes or no). They are then asked to respond to the statement ""the information I received about the new coronavirus outbreak is sufficient"" with five options, from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5). To assess the impact of mixed information during the outbreak, participants should answer the frequency with which they felt confused or concerned about the reliability of the information they received. Response options ranged from never (1) to always (5).
Public confidence is assessed by asking if they agreed with the statement ""I think I can take steps to protect myself against the new coronavirus"" with five response options from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5).
Brug et al, 2004, after the SARS pandemic, reported that the perceived risk, not the actual risk, determines the reaction of the population, despite the fact that these perceptions are often biased. The public can be optimistic when family risks are perceived to be largely under volitional control; Pessimism, which sometimes leads to mass panic, is more likely as a result of perceiving that the risks are uncontrollable. People who perceive themselves to be at risk for SARS or in our covid-19 research may have preventive behavior, but may also stigmatize those who perceive themselves as potential sources of infection. To promote realistic risk perceptions and effective precautions, communication through various sources of information is essential, justifying our dimensions.
Along the same lines, Ping Wu (2010) reported that the literature has documented that the levels of risk perceived in relation to an event such as SARS or in this case Covid-19 are currently affected by lack of familiarity. and the perceived uncontrollability of the dangers involved and that this can have a direct impact on mental health and the development of disorders, given the high level and ignorance and uncontrollability, for example by the continuous exposure of health workers to traumatic events such as deaths and critical condition of patients as happened in Beijing in 2002, despite this, people differ in their perceptions of the same situation.
Understanding the role of specific perceptions in motivating people to engage in preventive behaviors can help health communicators improve their messages about outbreaks of new infectious diseases in general and specifically about Covid-19.
3.	SA-45 
It is a questionnaire that includes 45 items on a five-level Likert scale with items ranging from 0 (""not at all"") to 4 (""very or extremely""). The questionnaire is derived from the original symptom checklist 90 (Scl-90; Derogatis, Lipman &amp; Covi, 1973) and seeks to evaluate the following dimensions: somatization, obsessive compulsion, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, ideation paranoid and psychoticism.
The questionnaire was developed mainly as a tool to evaluate the results obtained from different treatments applied to psychiatric patients (Davison et al., 1997), but studies with groups of non-clinical samples are being carried out as a means of determining the questionnaire and the potential usefulness of detecting the participants' general mental health level and / or the presence of any indication of psychological pathology or imbalance.
Created at the time to deal with the problems related to the scl.90: high overlap between items, low discriminant validity, imbalance of the scales in number of items (the scales have between 6 to 13 items), high correlation between scales, lack factorial validity and excessive length (Alvarado, Blanca; Sandín, Bonifacio; Valdez-Medina, Jose; Gonzales-Arratia Norma and Rivera, Sofia, 2012), the SA-45 maintains the same scales as the scl-90, but improvement in the following aspects:
• Significantly reduces the number of items (from 90 to 45 items)
• Equalizes all scales to the same number of items (5), which increases the possibility that the scales have similar reliability.
• Increases the ease and usefulness of the questionnaire.

Psychometric properties:
Despite still being much less in use than its predecessor, the SA-45 has shown its validity in various settings, such as clarification and prediction of psychiatric patients, evaluation of psychopathological changes in patients with health problems, studies on psychopathological screening (such as in epidemiological studies) and reflect effects of psychological treatment in psychiatric patients (Maruis, 2000, cited from Alvarado et al, 2012).
In 2008, a Spanish version of the SA-45 was validated by Sandin, Valiente, Chorot, and Santed, using an extensive sample of college students. Exploratory factor analyzes were carried out. Regarding the extraction of the number of factors, the researchers took into account 5 theoretical / empirical criteria: 9 basic dimensions, other possible structures found in the scl-90 (from 1 to 10 factors), Kaiser's criterion, screening test, interpretation of different resulting factor structures: the main axis method was also performed. In both cases, a structure of 9 correlated factors was obtained that corresponded to the nine subscales of the original Davison version. Oblique rotation results (promax) were presented, where moderate correlations were found between factors.
Using confirmatory factor analysis, the factor structure was replicated, where nine correlated factors were the structure that best fit the data, compared to single-factor structures (general factor of psychopathology), hierarchical model of nine primary factors, and two factors of higher order (neurosis and psychosis). It was concluded that SA-45 has scales that are separate, valid, and reliable, that are useful for various symptoms or psychopathological disorders. Compared with the scl-90, this test is abbreviated, and discriminates better, since the consistency of the dimensions and their validity has improved (Sandín et al., 2008). The cronbach's alpha of the total questionnaire is .95 (internal consistency) and, except for the psychoticism scale, all the subscales ranged from .71 to .85.
The SA-45 has been used in several aspects: merino in 2010 (cited from Alvarado et al, 2012), verified the utility of the instrument in individuals with burnout syndrome or work stress; Delclaux (2011, quoted from Alvarado et al, 2012) used it in patients diagnosed with cancer in chemotherapy regimen, where he found significant alterations in the subscales, mainly in depression, anxiety, somatization and obsession-compulsion; and it has also been used to assess the psychopathological effects of traumatic situations on ex-combatants of the Falklands war (Grill, Posada and Castañeiras, 2009).

4.	Intention to care patient with  Covid-19

A self-administered questionnaire (34 items) was used to collect data on intentions, attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, behavioral beliefs, normative beliefs, and control beliefs were the study variables. All items were measured using a 7-point likert scale (-3 to +3).
Kim et al, 2006, used the theory of planned behavior, which emerged through the theory of reasoned action (TRA) (Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980), at first Azjen and Fishbein (19880) argued that the mind, the motive or intention is a decisive factor that influences behaviors, so it was stated that the internal factor was the attitude towards a person's behavior (attitude), so this factor was accompanied by external factors, such as the opinions of others around them, that is, if their surroundings think they are important or invite them to do something they will eventually do so, however, research revealed that a person's intention does not necessarily lead to the practice of action, and they were plotted the limitations of TRA. Among the actions, there are actions that simply do not lead to the practice of the action by intention. For example, you want to exercise every day, but lack of time to exercise, the location of a distant gym, children who need attention, and housework. There are cases in which the act cannot be practiced although the intention is due to the surrounding conditions that interfere with the practice. So Azjen (1991) introduces the concept of perceived behavioral control, explained as the recognition of the ability to control behavior in the following way. Even if there are factors that interfere with the action, if you think you can adjust the obstacles to your own thoughts, you increase the intention to practice the action, and ultimately increase the degree of practice of the action. In conclusion, tpb affirms that human behavior is directly influenced by two factors: the intention of a person who wants to do it and the confidence that they can do it.
According to the theory of planned behavior (TBP), human behavior is guided by three types of considerations: beliefs about the likely consequences and experiences associated with the behavior (behavioral beliefs), beliefs about normative expectations, and behaviors of other significant people (beliefs regulations) and beliefs about the presence of factors that can facilitate or impede the performance of the behavior (control beliefs). In their respective aggregates, behavioral beliefs produce a favorable or unfavorable attitude toward behavior; normative beliefs result in perceived social pressure or subjective norm; and control beliefs lead to perceived behavioral control or self-efficacy. The effects of attitude toward behavior and subjective norm on intention are moderated by the perception of behavior control. As a general rule, the more favorable the attitude and subjective norm, and the greater the perceived control, the stronger the person's intention should be to perform the behavior in question. Finally, given a sufficient degree of actual control over behavior, people are expected to carry out their intentions when the opportunity arises. Therefore, intention is assumed to be the immediate antecedent to the behavior. To the extent that perceived behavioral control is true, it can serve as a proxy for actual control and contribute to predicting the behavior in question (Fishbein &amp; Azjen, 2010).

Psychometric properties:
Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, pearson's correlation method and multiple step regression methods. Kim et al, 2006, points out that the validity and reliability of the instrument were established through content validity, a pilot test, a reliability test and factor analysis. The result of the study is described elsewhere (Yoo, Kwon and Jang, 2005).
In the research by Yoo et al, 2005, the psychometric analysis of the survey data provided empirical evidence of the construct validity and reliability of the instrument. The main component analysis verified the hypothetical solution of 6 factors, explaining 68.2% of the variance, and the alpha coefficients of .75 to .93 indicated a high internal consistency of the instrument.

5.	Risk Perception

Compared to other risk domains, such as environmental risks, much less is known about how the public perceives the risks associated with emerging infectious diseases (Zwart et al. 2009). Most of the evidence on risk perception comes from studies during previous pandemics, especially the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009 (Fischhoff et al., 2018; Rudisill 2013; Prati, Pietrantoni and Zani 2011), the Ebola outbreak (Prati and Pietrantoni 2016; Yang and Chu 2018) and SARS and avian influenza (bird flu) epidemics (Leppin and Aro 2009). Although this research has been important and informative, reviews have noted that a common feature of rapid response studies is that many of them are exploratory and descriptive in nature and therefore a) are not based on established models of theory. risk perception, b) are based almost exclusively on single-element risk perception measures that selectively take advantage of cognitive or emotional dimensions, and c) do not include important international comparisons (de Zwart et al. 2009; Leppin and Aro 2009) .
Van der Linden's instrument, in collaboration with his team, contains 6 items to assess the perception that the new coronavirus COvid-19 represents in terms of risk, consequently, here we adopt a theory-based approach to the study of the perception of risk. Van der Linden's (2015, 2017) risk perception model recommends the inclusion of groups of variables that correspond to the cognitive tradition (for example, people's knowledge and understanding of risks) experiential tradition (for example, personal experience), the sociocultural paradigm (for example, the social amplification of risk, cultural theory, trust and values) and the relevant individual differences (for example, gender, education, ideology).

Psychometric Properties:
Following Leiserowitz (2006), Van der Linden (2015) and Xie et al. (2019), our dependent measure ""COVID-19 Risk Perception"" was measured as an index, covering affective, cognitive and spatio-temporal dimensions to provide a holistic measure of risk perception. The index included items that captured the perceived severity of the COVID-19 pandemic participants, the perceived probability of contracting the virus themselves for the next 6 months, the perceived probability that their family and friends would contract the virus, and its level current concern about the virus (alpha grouped in all countries, a .72; alpha per country, such as .60 - .82)

Impact of Vietnam-era G.I. Bill eligibility on later-life blood pressure distribution: evidence from the Vietnam draft lottery natural experiment,"Abstract
               We quantified the impact of Vietnam-era G.I Bill eligibility, which subsidized college education for eligible Veterans, on the later-life blood pressure distribution by exploiting the Vietnam draft lottery natural experiment. We restricted Health and Retirement Study data (2006-2018) to men born between 1947-1953 (N=1,970). We estimated intention-to-treat effects at the mean and 1st-99th quantiles of blood pressure using linear and quantile regressions. Our outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), hypertension, and self-reported stroke. We proxied G.I. Bill eligibility using lottery-defined draft eligibility. We also conducted analyses stratified by childhood socioeconomic status (cSES) defined based on a previously validated measure. Draft eligibility reduced mean blood pressure outcomes (e.g., effect on SBP: -1.33 [95% confidence interval (CI) -2.85, 0.19]). Draft eligibility also had larger protective effects at higher quantiles of the SBP and DBP distributions relative to lower quantiles (effects on SBP at the 10th and 90th quantiles: -0.33mmHg [95% CI -2.35,1.68]; -3.00mmHg [95% CI -5.68,-0.32]). Draft eligibility had protective effects on blood pressure among low and medium cSES men but opposite effects among high cSES men. G.I. Bill eligibility reshaped the blood pressure distribution to one of lower morbidity risk, particularly among low and medium cSES men.",step2,True
"The Construction of the ""Older Worker""","The notion of the “older worker” is frequently used in the organizational literature, in organizational practice, and in society, but so far no research has investigated why people consider someone to be an older worker at a certain age. In the qualitative part of this study, we examined potential reasons for considering workers to be “older” at a certain age. In the quantitative part of this study, we investigated demographic characteristics (i.e., age, sex, education), job characteristics (i.e., job level, typical age in a job), and beliefs (i.e., perceived remaining time at work, motivation to continue working after retirement, positive and negative age stereotypes) as predictors of people’ conceptions of “older worker age.” Data were provided by 269 employees from various jobs and organizations. The mean age at which participants’ considered someone to be an “older worker” was approximately 55 years (SD = 8.9). The most frequently stated reasons for considering workers to be “older” at a certain age were retirement age and age-related decline.

Broad-based employee stock ownership and profit sharing,"PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to review the historical background for broad-based ownership in the USA, the development of forms of employee ownership and profit sharing in the USA, the research literature on employee ownership and profit sharing and related employee participation, the development of policy and options for new policies.Design/methodology/approachIt is a literature review.FindingsThere are four reasons to be interested in employee stock ownership and profit sharing today: first, employee share ownership and profit sharing can increase worker pay and wealth and broaden the overall distribution of income and wealth, a key ingredient for a successful democracy. To be a tool for reducing inequality, employee stock ownership and profit sharing must be spread more widely and meaningfully than it is today. Second, employee share ownership and profit sharing provide incentives for more effort, cooperation, information sharing and innovation that can improve workplace performance and company productivity. Third, employee share ownership and profit sharing can save jobs by enhancing firm survival and employment stability, with wider economic benefits that come from decreasing unemployment. Fourth, employee share ownership and profit sharing can create more harmonious workplaces with greater corporate transparency and increased worker involvement in their work lives through access to information and participation in workplace decisions.Research limitations/implicationsGrowth has been extraordinarily sluggish in the recovery from the Great Recession and has weakened in advanced countries over a longer period, leading some analysts to believe that the authors have entered a new economic era of small to modest growth. This may turn out to be true, which will increase the importance of growth-enhancing policies. The evidence that firms with employee stock ownership and/or profit-sharing perform better than others suggests that policies that extend ownership would boost the country’s lagging growth rate. The evidence that employee share ownership firms preserve jobs and survive recessions better than others suggests that policies that extend ownership could help stabilize the economy when the next recession comes down the pike.Practical implicationsBecause there may be informational or institutional barriers about the benefits of ownership and sharing and the ways firms can introduce such programs that government can help overcome. Government has often played a role in promoting performance-enhancing work practices to enhance overall economy-wide outcomes from higher productivity and innovation, such as the long history of agricultural extension services (since 1887) to spread information on best practices in farming, and employer education on safety practices conducted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.Social implicationsBecause of the “externalities” – effects that extend beyond the firm and its members – that greater ownership/profit sharing can bring us. If employee ownership and profit sharing lead to fewer layoffs and firm closures, this can reduce recession-created drops in consumer purchasing power and aggregate demand; government expenditures on unemployment compensation and other forms of support; decreased tax base for supporting schools and infrastructure; and potentially harmful social and personal effects, such as marital breakups and alcohol abuse. Apart from unemployment, more broadly shared prosperity and lower inequality may also have wider benefits for macroeconomic growth, stability and societal outcomes, as described by a number of social scientists. To the extent the ownership and profit sharing is a public good, a nudge in policy to consider the idea makes sense.Originality/valueBecause it is hard to find policy options that are as bipartisan as the shares policy.

Internal pilot studies for estimating sample size,"AbstractWe develop the idea of using data from the first ‘few’ patients entered in a clinical trial to estimate the final trial size needed to have specified power for rejecting H0 in favour of H1 if a real difference exists. When comparing means derived from Normally distributed data, there is no important effect on test size, power or expected trial size, provided that a minimum of about 20 degrees of freedom are used to estimate residual variance. Relative advantages and disadvantages of using larger internal pilot studies are presented. These revolve around crude expectations of the final study size, recruitment rate, duration of follow‐up and practical constraints on the ability to prevent the circulation of unblinded randomization codes to investigators and those involved in editing and checking data.",step2,True
Using the Poisson Distribution for Estimating Households by Household Size,"Infrastructure planners often require detail about the number of households by household size at very small levels of geography (census tract or smaller) to calibrate their models. In addition, these data must also be projected into the future in order to support planning efforts.

This paper documents a statistical technique for estimating the distribution of households by household size using a modified application of the Poisson distribution. This technique is valuable to demographers as it provides a simple and reliable tool for estimating the distribution of household sizes at nearly any level of geography for a given point in time.

There are a wide variety of applications of the Poisson distribution in biology and engineering. However, there are only few documented applications in demographics. This article puts forth two key advancements over prior published work:
(1) an entirely new, and greatly simplified method for applying the distribution,
(2) evidence of the reliability of the technique for estimating household size distributions in small geographic areas (e.g. counties and census tracts).

Tests on U.S. Census data (1990-2010) suggest that the model is suitable for use in estimating the distribution of households by household size at the state, county, and census tract level.",step2,True

Firm‐level productivity and exporting in Uganda's manufacturing sector,"PurposeThis paper aims to investigate firm‐level interactions between productivity and exporting in Uganda's manufacturing sector.Design/methodology/approachThe paper empirically tested two hypotheses that relate to the dynamic gains from trade and also have tended to dominate the literature; self‐selection and learning‐by‐exporting hypotheses. It employs proxies of self‐selection and learning‐by‐exporting obtained from indices of path dependence to fit maximum likelihood estimates of export behavior.FindingsThe results provide support for both hypotheses and it is also found that more experienced exporters reap more productivity gains from learning effects which is in line with the view that knowledge spillovers to exporting firms increase with the level of interaction in the global market place. Thus, learning‐by‐exporting is not a “short term” occurrence which takes place only in the first few years of entry in export markets after which it would fizzle out as a firm's exporting experience increases but rather, it is a cumulative process.Practical implicationsThis paper generates a number of insights that can guide policy makers in designing policies to promote firm productivity growth that is an engine of growth in the private sector and by extension, would fuel up overall economic growth and poverty reduction.Originality/valuePrevious studies on exports and growth in Uganda have been basically focused on macro‐data analysis; yet, promoting rapid expansion of manufactured exports may require more than just a good macroeconomic policy environment. This study fills the research gap by relating firm‐level productivity performance to the microeconomic environment in which manufacturing firms operate.",step2,True
Influence of agglomeration and selection effects on the Chinese construction industry," The determination of whether market size can influence industrial agglomeration or selection is an important topic in economic development. To analyse the differential economic development of the construction industry under different market sizes, this research analyses the employment density of China’s provinces and their total factor productivity (TFP). It also analyses whether the differences in the provinces’ productivity are explained by their agglomeration and selection effects. First, a data envelopment analysis–Malmquist model is used to calculate the TFP of each construction industry sub-sector. Then, a nested model is used to measure the influence of the selection and the agglomeration effects on the TFP at different market sizes of the construction industry. Results evidence that there are significant differences in the construction productivity of different sub-sectors in different regions of China. These differences are mainly the consequence of the agglomeration effect, rather than the selection effect. Findings of this study suggest that the Chinese construction industry should optimise its structure in different provinces to achieve a balanced growth at different market sizes. ",step2,True
Models of Sectoral Reallocation,"This paper demonstrates several strengths and shortcomings of models of sectoral reallocation. Although such models demonstrate that sectoral reallocation can be an important amplification and propagation mechanism for exogenous shocks, they are essentially unable to explain any effects of sectoral reallocation on aggregate productivity or related quantities (such as the real wage or observations of aggregate increasing returns to scale), unless a wedge is introduced into the model that drives the marginal products of inputs in different sectors apart in steady state. In particular, costs of adjustment and lags to adjustment are not sufficient. This paper offers a solution to the problem in the form of variable sectoral capital utilization, the marginal product of which can differ across sectors in steady state. Reallocations of production between sectors in this setting are then shown to have first-order effects on aggregate productivity and real wages, and can explain the procyclicality of these variables without reliance on large, exogenous, and persistent shocks to technology.",step2,True
Understanding the Native–Immigrant Wage Gap Using Matched Employer-Employee Data," In this article, the author proposes a new method for measuring wage discrimination that builds on the methodology first developed by Hellerstein and Neumark (1999).

Measuring Agency Costs over the Business Cycle,"This paper investigates the joint effects of manager–shareholder agency conflicts and macroeconomic risk on corporate policies and firm value. I first derive the implications of a structural model of a firm with assets in place and an investment opportunity, run by a self-interested manager who captures part of the firm’s net income as private benefits. The model implies that dynamic aggregate agency costs are driven by firms in the upper half of the distribution of private benefits. Managers of those firms capture 0.8% of firms’ net income on average, thereby decreasing aggregate firm value by 1.7%. These agency costs are procyclical (1.9% in booms and 1.4% in recessions) because managerial underleverage decreases default costs particularly in recessions. Furthermore, the model can explain empirical regularities, including the joint level and cyclicality of leverage.The Internet appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2813 .This paper was accepted by Gustavo Manso, finance.",step2,True
Burning Cash for Growth: Success and Failure Case Studies of Startups,"Rachmad, Yoesoep Edhie. 2020. Burning Cash for Growth: Success and Failure Case Studies of Startups. International Journal of Startup Research, Volume 18, No 2. https://doi.org/10.17605/osf.io/sw3m5


        
In his 2020 publication ""Burning Cash for Growth: Success and Failure Case Studies of Startups,"" featured in the ""International Journal of Startup Research,"" Volume 18, Issue 2, Yoesoep Edhie Rachmad critically examines the outcomes of startups that adopt high-cash-burn strategies to fuel rapid growth. This study juxtaposes case studies of both successful and unsuccessful startups to dissect the factors that influence the results of such aggressive financial strategies.
Background: Set against the backdrop of a highly competitive startup environment, the research investigates the increasing tendency among startups to expend large amounts of capital in short periods. This approach is often aimed at capturing market share, accelerating product development, and scaling operations before achieving profitability.
Definition and Basic Concepts: The ""burning cash for growth"" strategy is defined as startups' intentional spending of capital at a rate that exceeds their current revenue generation. The aim is to achieve accelerated growth and market penetration. This strategy is commonly supported by substantial venture capital investment with the expectation of achieving rapid scalability and long-term gains.
Phenomenon: This phenomenon is rooted in the venture capital model, which encourages rapid growth to establish market dominance or achieve technological breakthroughs. The approach reflects a broader trend within the tech industry and other sectors where market conditions favor first movers and disruptors.
Problem Formulation: The main challenge explored in the research is to understand when and why burning cash leads to success or failure in the startup ecosystem. It also seeks to identify the critical factors that should guide startups' decisions regarding spending for growth.
Research Objectives: The objectives include analyzing the strategic use of high-cash-burn rates in various contexts and determining the key variables that predict success or failure. The study aims to provide actionable insights for startups considering this risky yet potentially rewarding approach.
Qualitative Research Methodology: The methodology employs a comparative case study approach, analyzing a series of startups that have either succeeded spectacularly or failed disastrously after implementing high-cash-burn strategies. Detailed interviews with founders, investors, and industry analysts enrich the study with diverse perspectives on the causes and effects of these financial strategies.
Criteria and Respondent Selection: Respondents were selected based on their direct involvement in startups with notable cash-burn strategies. The study includes 12 startups across technology, consumer goods, and service industries, each providing a distinct context and outcome for analysis.
Research Indicators: Indicators of success or failure include the startup’s ability to achieve sustainable market presence, the subsequent rounds of funding secured, profitability milestones, and the ultimate viability of the business.
Operational Variables: These variables consist of the rate of cash burn, the timing and scale of investments, the specific objectives targeted by the expenditures (e.g., market expansion, technology development), and the efficiency of capital utilization.
Determining Factors: The research identifies several key factors impacting the outcomes of high-cash-burn strategies, such as the clarity of strategic vision, market readiness for the product or service, competitive landscape, and the startup’s ability to adapt to changing market conditions.
Research Findings: The findings illustrate that while some startups achieve rapid growth and market dominance through high-cash-burn strategies, others suffer from premature scaling, depleted resources, and strategic misalignments that lead to failure. The success of the strategy heavily depends on precise execution and favorable market conditions.
Conclusion and Recommendations: The study concludes that burning cash for growth is a high-risk strategy that can yield high rewards under the right circumstances. It recommends that startups employing this strategy should have a clear, scalable business model, robust financial controls, and contingency plans to manage risks associated with rapid spending. Moreover, continuous market validation and strategic flexibility are crucial for adjusting the course as needed.
This research provides a nuanced view of the high-cash-burn strategy in startups, offering vital lessons and guidelines for entrepreneurs and investors navigating this high-stakes approach to business growth.

"Examining the effect of depression, anxiety, and stress on longitudinal drinking outcomes following an alcohol-focused personalized feedback intervention","Both single component personalized normative feedback (PNF) and multicomponent computerized personalized feedback interventions (PFI) reduce drinking norms, alcohol use, and alcohol-related consequences among college students (Larimer et al, 2022). There is some evidence that the presence of mental health symptoms may impact the efficacy of alcohol-focused brief interventions. Although some studies demonstrate reduced effectiveness of PFI in reducing alcohol use and consequences for students with elevated depression (Geisner et al., 2015) or social anxiety (Terlecki et al., 2012), others find PFI to demonstrate significant effects for reducing consequences for those with mild-moderate levels of depression (Miller et al., 2020). Intervention outcomes could differ by severity of mental health symptoms, as well as the complexity of intervention (e.g., single-component versus multicomponent PFI). To improve prevention efforts and provide tailored feedback that is most relevant to college students, clinical researchers must first understand whether undergraduates with elevated mental health symptoms benefit from existing universal prevention efforts, and if so, which type of personalized feedback is most effective. Results from this work will guide adaptations to PNF/PFI to address the needs of individuals vulnerable to both mental health symptoms and substance use problems. 

The present study seeks to test whether baseline levels of depression, physical anxiety, and stress symptoms moderate the association between receipt of a PFI intervention and drinking-related outcomes at 3-, 6-, and 12-months post-intervention.",step2,True

Establishing determinant relevance using CIBER: an introduction and tutorial,"When developing behavior change interventions, it is important to target the most important determinants of behavior (i.e. psychological constructs that predict behavior). This is challenging for two reasons. First, determinant selection requires integrating multiple information sources: determinants' associations with either behavior or with determinant that mediate their effect on behavior (i.e. effect sizes), as well as how much room for improvement there is in the population (i.e. means and spread). Second, only information from samples is normally available, and point estimates obtained from samples vary from sample to sample, and therefore cannot be interpreted without information about how much they can be expected to vary over samples. In practice, determinant studies often present multivariate regression analyses, but this is problematic because by default, shared covariance is removed from the equation (literally), compromising operationalisations' validity and affecting effect sizes (i.e., the results of such analyses cannot be used as a first source of information regarding each determinant's association to behavior). In the present contribution, we will briefly explain these points in more detail, after which we will introduce a solution: confidence interval based estimation of relevance (CIBER). We will then present a brief tutorial as to how to generate CIBER plots and how to interpret them. This is a more detailed explanation and introduction: originally, CIBER was published in Crutzen, Peters &amp; Noijen (2017).",step2,True
Corporate Restructuring,"A corporate entity which is in financial distress can resolve its predicament in two broad approaches. The first is by engaging in a formal bankruptcy procedure, which commonly involves a court, and enables the debtor to deal with creditors collectively. Alternatively, it can engage in an out of court restructuring based around negotiations with individual creditors. This article focuses on the engagements of corporate restructuring outside the formal statutory insolvency procedure and in particular prenegotiated deals, private workouts and pre-packs. The first section of the article provides a background to the out of court restructuring and underscores the many advantages it holds as compared to the formal insolvency proceedings. It then explores the development and usage of selected informal approaches to corporate restructuring. It concludes with an analysis of the place of informal strategies in Kenya. It is argues for the need to develop a functional equivalent of a workout which allows for the possibility of having mechanisms tailored on realities of a developing economy. However, having an effective workout is hugely dependent on the existence of reliable formal mechanisms to at least act as a threat of enforceable legal approach, and the weaknesses inherent in the Kenya formal mechanisms may be an impediment.",step2,True
Synthetic population data for small area estimation in the United States," Small area estimation is critical for a wide range of applications, including urban planning, funding distribution, and policy formulation. Individual-level population data, which typically include each individual’s socio-demographic characteristics and small area location, are a rich source of information for small area estimation. However, individual-level population data are often not made public due to confidentiality concerns. This paper describes the development of a public-use synthetic individual-level population dataset in the United States that can be useful for small area estimation. This dataset contains characteristics of housing type, age, sex, race, and Hispanic or Latino origin for all 308,745,538 individuals in the United States at the census block group level, based on publicly available aggregated data from the 2010 Census. Experimental results suggest the validity of the synthetic data by comparing it to different data sources, and we show examples of how this dataset can be used in small area estimation. ",step2,True

The model is estimated by applying the method of indirect inference on Swedish register data, and then used to carry out some policy experiments. There are three key conclusions from these experiments. First, employment shocks early in life can, to a larger extent, be mitigated before retirement compared with employment shocks occurring later. Second, we find that idiosyncratic productivity shocks, unobserved heterogeneity, and education contribute substantially to life‐cycle earnings inequality. Finally, we find that transitory shocks to employment risk have negative effects on earnings and employment in the short run but may increase labor market fluidity in the medium run.",step2,True
Hospital Prices,"Over 150 million Americans receive health insurance through an employer or union. Most employers rely on insurance companies to act as agents and negotiate prices with hospitals and other health care providers and both design and administer benefits. While this contracting structure should create incentives to constrain costs, recent empirical work has highlighted both the wide variability in prices paid by employer plans and the high level of prices relative to Medicare and other public payers.
Hospital and insurer markets are imperfectly competitive, and several recent studies have modeled hospital prices as equilibrium outcomes of bargaining between hospitals and insurers; Ho and Lee (2017) also link hospital price setting to insurer market structure and bargaining over premiums between insurers and employers. However, little existing work has examined how insurer monopoly power with employers leads to monopsony power in the hospital market. If negotiating prices requires substantial effort (i.e., transaction costs), then insurers with monopoly power in the insurance market may be unwilling or unable to exploit their monopsony power in bargaining with hospitals.
Relatedly, existing literature has only briefly examined how the structure of hospital-insurer contracts explains pricing patterns. Hospital-insurance contracts range from contracts that specify a multiplier of Medicare rates, contracts that use a discounted rate of billed charges, and contracts that separately negotiate different prices for different procedures. The characteristics of hospitals, employers, and insurers that use these various contracting forms is not known, and the literature on insurer-hospital bargaining has not incorporated variation in the form of insurer-hospital contracts into structural models.
Finally, while the existing literature finds that many physician contracts are based on a percentage of Medicare, the influence of Medicare payments on hospital prices paid by private insurers has only rarely been examined. Cooper et al. (2019) documented that percentage-of-Medicare contracts are less common among hospitals than among physicians. We will follow the approach of Clemens &amp; Gottlieb (2017) and examine how administrative updates to Medicare payment rates influence private insurance prices for inpatient and outpatient hospital care.
1.1.1.	Overview
In this project, we will use a multi-state, multi-payer database of hospital claims to provide new evidence on how hospital prices paid by private insurers are determined across a broader cross-section of US hospital markets and payers than has previously been examined.
The ultimate goal of this study is to develop and estimate a structural model of hospital-insurer bargaining that is capable of explaining price variation observed within hospital markets, individual hospitals, and hospital-insurer pairs as an equilibrium outcome of hospital-insurer bargaining. Our modeling approach will build on the framework developed by Gowrisankaran, Nevo, Town (2015), and related papers, but extend their model to incorporate data on the form of hospital-insurer contracts, perhaps by allowing for transaction costs associated with insurer bargaining that depend on the contract form. In order to inform this modeling effort, we have also planned a number of descriptive analyses that are pre-specified in this analysis plan.
Many of our initial analyses will focus on basic descriptive statistics characterizing the degree of variation in hospital prices and the associations between hospital prices and factors such as hospital market structure, insurer market structure, and employer characteristics, as in Cooper et al. (2019). We will also use a new method for inferring hospital contract structure from claims data to describe the prevalence and correlates of Medicare-based, charge-based, and other contract forms, as well as associations between contract form and price. After describing the extent of cross-sectional variation in hospital prices and the relative importance of variation across hospitals, within hospitals across insurers, and within hospital-insurer pairs across employers, we will also use linear regression models to describe the association between prices and market structure while controlling for hospital, insurer, employer, and market characteristics. Finally, we will follow previous studies (Cooper et al. (2019) for hospitals and Clemens and Gottlieb (2017) for physicians) and reexamine the relationship between Medicare payments and private hospital prices.
Contributions
Many of our initial descriptive analyses are intended to replicate or reexamine those conducted in several recent studies on hospital prices, particularly Cooper et al. (2019) and Craig, Ericson and Starc (2018). Compared to these papers and other studies that have described variation in hospital prices, an innovation of our study is the use of a unique claims database with unprecedented breadth in terms of the scope of payers included and geographic diversity. In contrast to the HCCI data used by Cooper et al. (2019), which contain claims from three of the five largest nationwide insurers, our data include claims from some BCBS insurers. We also use all-payer claims database (APCD) data from seven states, which captures fully-insured business in the small group market, including smaller insurance carriers that are not captured in more widely used multi-payer commercial claims datasets such as Marketscan or HCCI. While Craig, Ericson, and Starc (2018) analyze a broad range of payers using data from the Massachusetts APCD, our claims database includes employers in several states, providing us with many more hospital markets and, potentially, greater cross-sectional variation in market structure with which to examine hospital price determination. Finally, we will provide new evidence on the role of contract structure as a mechanism explaining hospital price variation.

The purpose of this paper is to understand the heterogeneity of family firm innovation.Design/methodology/approach– The authors draw on governance literature and the socioemotional wealth (SEW) perspective to examine how the extent of family governance and the type of SEW objectives jointly influence innovation strategies in family firms.Findings– The authors develop a typology of family firm innovation strategies, positing that the family firm’s risk orientation, innovation goal, and knowledge diversity vary depending on the degree of family involvement in governance and the type of SEW objective. The authors propose that four family firm innovation strategies (e.g. Limited Innovators, Intended Innovators, Potential Innovators, and Active Innovators) emerge when family involvement in the dominant coalition (high or low) is contrasted with the SEW objective (restricted or extended) pursued by the family.Practical implications– Understanding how governance and SEW goals work together to influence the firm’s innovation strategies is potentially valuable for managers of family firms. The authors offer practical suggestions for how to strategically reposition the firm to pursue innovation strategies more in line with those of the Active Innovator.Originality/value– This study contributes to the family business literature by using a multi-dimensional approach to examine family firm heterogeneity. In addition, by articulating various family firm innovation strategies, the authors offer insight into the previously inconsistent findings concerning firm innovation behavior and outcomes in family business studies.",step2,True
Antecedents and consequences of employee engagement,"PurposeEmployee engagement has become a hot topic in recent years among consulting firms and in the popular business press. However, employee engagement has rarely been studied in the academic literature and relatively little is known about its antecedents and consequences. The purpose of this study was to test a model of the antecedents and consequences of job and organization engagements based on social exchange theory.Design/methodology/approachA survey was completed by 102 employees working in a variety of jobs and organizations. The average age was 34 and 60 percent were female. Participants had been in their current job for an average of four years, in their organization an average of five years, and had on average 12 years of work experience. The survey included measures of job and organization engagement as well as the antecedents and consequences of engagement.FindingsResults indicate that there is a meaningful difference between job and organization engagements and that perceived organizational support predicts both job and organization engagement; job characteristics predicts job engagement; and procedural justice predicts organization engagement. In addition, job and organization engagement mediated the relationships between the antecedents and job satisfaction, organizational commitment, intentions to quit, and organizational citizenship behavior.Originality/valueThis is the first study to make a distinction between job and organization engagement and to measure a variety of antecedents and consequences of job and organization engagement. As a result, this study addresses concerns about that lack of academic research on employee engagement and speculation that it might just be the latest management fad.",step2,True
"Environmental quality, local infrastructures, and residential choice: A survey experiment on ethnic differences in neighborhood preferences","# Description and motivation of hypotheses

Stratification research increasingly recognizes that inequalities are location dependent, that is, clustered in space, with neighborhoods often being the locus of inequality (Sharkey 2008). One crucial dimension of spatial inequality is environmental quality (e.g., pollution levels or proximity to green spaces). Environmental quality at the place of residence has been shown to affect health and life chances more broadly. Robust associations and plausibly causal effects of environmental quality have been demonstrated for numerous key outcomes, including physical (Currie and Walker 2011) and mental health (Engemann et al. 2019, Zhen et al. 2019, Roberts et al. 2019), crime (Bondy et al. 2020), educational attainment (Heissel et al. 2019, Persico 2020, Persico and Venator 2021), and economic mobility (O’Brien et al. 2018). 

From the literature on “environmental justice”, we know that some population subgroups are disproportionately exposed to environmental hazards at their place of residence (Ash and Boyce 2018, Sobotta et al. 2007, Engemann et al. 2019). The processes that underlie this empirical regularity are not well understood, however. One prominent explanation is that environmental inequality is a result of market mechanisms whereby low-income groups are forced to settle in less attractive neighborhoods with lower housing prices. However, studies from both the US (Downey and Hawkins 2008) and also Germany (Rüttenauer 2018) have shown that ethnic minorities bear a disproportionate burden of environmental hazards at the neighborhood level, even after controlling for income and other aspects of socio-economic status (SES). Therefore, these purely economic explanations of selective in- and out-migration appear insufficient for explaining the spatial distribution of environmental goods and bads observed. 

This conclusion is underlined by a recent longitudinal study that finds native German households to experience improvements of environmental quality at the place of residence conditional on moving, whereas minority households do not (Best and Rüttenauer 2018).  Best and Rüttenauer (2018) have no direct information on the factors shaping relocation decisions, so it remains largely unclear why minorities are less likely to move into better neighborhoods, but financial resources seem to play a rather minor role.
This pre-registration outlines a conjoint survey experiment aimed to test the role of residential preferences as a possible explanation of population sorting that is difficult to assess with observational data. 

Within our survey experiment, respondents of immigrant and non-immigrant origins will be presented with several pairs of neighborhood profiles and will be asked to choose in which of these neighborhoods they would rather live in. The different neighborhood profiles will be random combinations of several key attributes that might affect residential choices. Comparing the sensitivity of residential choices to different attributes across respondents with and without immigrant origins will help us better understand to what extent empirical patterns of residential segregation reflect the realization of different preferences or whether empirical patterns are rather due to structural explanations such as economic resources or discrimination in the housing market. Crucially, the experiment allows us to separate, and thereby disentangle, the role of factors that are empirically correlated, most importantly environmental quality and the presence of co-ethnics and ethnic infrastructures.",step2,True
Estimating freight origin destination matrices using combined commodity flow survey and roadside survey data,"The paucity of available data was limiting studies of freight flow in Thailand. To overcome this problem, commodity flow survey (CFS) and comprehensive freight transportation by truck using roadside survey (RS) were launched to collect comprehensive freight flow data throughout the kingdom of Thailand. Since these two surveys were pioneering and due to budgetary limitations, the resulting data are still incomplete and must be adjusted. The need to produce a freight origin destination matrix using available data from CFS and RS led to the objectives of this research. This research has two main objectives. The first is to develop a methodology for combining CFS and RS. The second is to develop a method for filling gaps in the origin destination matrix based on the Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) approach. The methodology to combine these two data sources was developed which uses the strengths of each method, the CFS distribution pattern and the RS marginal total. The first method is Trip Length Distribution Adjusting (TLDA), which uses adjustments to CFS trip length distribution to meet RS marginal total. The second method is Gravity Model Approach (GMA), which uses CFS friction functions to adjust RS data matrix. The method was calibrated using two difference sources of roadside survey. The results indicated that the adjusted volumes of the two data sources agreed despite being collected at different times and by different authors, and that the differences between the total adjusted volumes were quite small. It can therefore be concluded that the developed method can be used to adjust the data. For the second component, a model using BOX-COX transformation and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference system (ANFIS) was developed and verified against a convention gravity model. Two types of model, using convention gravity variables and using socio-economic variables, were developed. The results showed that the ANFIS model outperformed both the conventional gravity model and the BOX-COX model. These results proved the performance of the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system for modeling complex system and its ability to model freight trip distribution.",step2,True
Antiretroviral Therapy Adherence Dynamics Among Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Beneficiaries,"Lack of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) remains one of the greatest barriers to ending the HIV epidemic in the US, including in Philadelphia — one of 48 counties selected as priority jurisdictions by the US Department of Health and Human Services Ending the HIV Epidemic Initiative (EHE). Understanding the role of poverty alleviation interventions in shaping HIV outcomes is vital for addressing EHE priorities, with 40% of people with HIV (PWH) in the US living below the poverty line. Poverty alleviation may affect HIV outcomes not only through economic mechanisms but also through psychological mechanisms (i.e., improvements in mental bandwidth, future orientation). Nearly 40% of PWH in the US participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which provides cash-like benefits to low-income households to buy food and has been shown to reduce poverty through mechanisms such as improved food security and long-run employment. Two features of SNAP benefit delivery allow estimation of causal effects of cash transfers on antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence. First, SNAP benefit receipt leads to a significant but temporary increase in one’s ability to meet daily needs (i.e., alleviating scarcity), leading to a monthly “SNAP cycle” of spending behaviors, food security, and health outcomes. Second, payment timing within each month is based on a recipient’s case number, which is essentially random. We will leverage these characteristics to assess the causal effects of short-term scarcity alleviation on ART adherence and the psychological processes underlying decision-making. We will conduct a 4 month longitudinal study of 60 PWH with SNAP in Philadelphia who report missing ≥2 doses of ART over the prior 30 days. We will assess the effect of SNAP receipt on ART adherence by using electronic pill bottle caps (CleverCaps) and comparing adherence before and after payment in regression models that include individual and month fixed effects. Our central hypothesis is that SNAP receipt is associated with higher daily adherence. This will be one of the first studies of the effect of America’s largest cash transfer program on HIV behaviors, and the potential mechanisms behind this effect. Our long-term goal is to generate evidence on poverty alleviation’s effects on HIV outcomes and to develop innovative poverty-alleviating interventions to improve HIV outcomes.",step2,True
Childbearing intention and childbearing behavior in low fertility society: evidence from Shanghai,"AbstractExploring the patterns of population change under low fertility is a historical mission for demographic research in the 21st century. Taking Shanghai as an example, this paper discusses the new patterns and characteristics of people’s childbearing intention and behavior under low fertility settings. The results show that Shanghai, as a typical society with ultra-low fertility, people’s childbearing intention and behavior demonstrate the characteristics such as “downward inconsistency” between childbearing intention and childbearing behavior, “convergence” of childbearing intention and childbearing behavior between different sub-groups, “inversion” in childbearing intention and childbearing behavior with education and income, and the “decoupling” between marriage and childbearing. The childbearing intention and behavior of low fertility society as seen in the case of Shanghai show the patterns as somehow different from what was observed in a high fertility society. It suggests that many of the childbearing patterns shown in the high-fertility era may not necessarily be applicable in low fertility settings, and urges more research to be carried out in this regard.",step2,True
Barriers and facilitators to  fertility behavior of Chinese couple in childbearing age: A scoping review,"Population dynamics play a crucial role in shaping global socioeconomic development. Since the mid-20th century, a notable decline in global fertility rates has emerged as a widespread phenomenon. Specifically, between 1950 and 2021, the global fertility rate decreased from 4.84 to 2.23. According to the most recent decennial census, China's population stands at approximately 1.41 billion, constituting nearly 18% of the global populace. Based on data from the ""Seventh National Population Census,"" China's fertility rate has now positioned the country among those with ultra-low fertility rates. China's fertility rate has undergone an especially marked reduction, falling from 5.8 to 1.15, a decrease that significantly surpasses the global average. In light of the ongoing decline in fertility rates, projections from the ""World Population Prospects 2024"" indicate that substantial demographic shifts are expected. Under the medium variant scenario, it is projected that China's total population will decrease to 1.26 billion by 2050 and further decline to 0.63 billion by 2100.
These transformations are anticipated to exert significant influence on China's economic development and social structure, manifesting in phenomena such as labor shortages and accelerated population aging.Furthermore, they are likely to present challenges to global sustainable development, impact the international economic landscape, and potentially lead to the decline of civilizations.
In the examination of the multifaceted factors contributing to the decline in fertility rates, it is widely recognized within the academic community that couples of reproductive age represent a critical demographic for targeted interventions. Their childbearing behaviors exert a direct and substantial influence on overall fertility rates. Since the previous century, considerable scholarly attention has been devoted to investigating the fertility behaviors of couples within this demographic.Hofmann, Barbara, and her colleagues have conducted an analysis of the economic conditions that influence fertility behaviors. Their findings suggest that job displacement during economic downturns adversely impacts women's fertility, indicating that economic factors may serve as barriers to childbearing. Additionally, research by Axinn, William G., and colleagues demonstrates that emotional connections between spouses significantly affect fertility decisions, with a strong marital bond often facilitating the decision to have children, even in the absence of economic rationality. However, these research findings may not be entirely generalizable to the Chinese context, and there is a conspicuous lack of systematic reviews examining the fertility behaviors of couples of childbearing age in China. 

This study seeks to identify, appraise, and synthesize the barriers and facilitators influencing the fertility behaviors of Chinese couples of childbearing age.",step2,True

This study explores the synthetic data approach for the release and analysis of business data. Australian businesses in some industries are characterised by oligopoly or duopoly. This means the existing microdata protection techniques such as information reduction or perturbation may not be as effective as for household microdata. The research focuses on addressing the following questions: Can a synthetic data approach enhance microdata access for the longitudinal business data? What is the utility and protection trade-off using the synthetic data approach?

International Shipping Costs Pass Through to Inflation; Evidence Using Census Import Data,"Abstract
        The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on supply chains and the highest inflation since the 1980s have drawn significant attention to the link between supply chains and inflation. Recent literature has documented several channels through which increased supply chain congestion can have significant pass through effects to inflation. One of these channels is that worsening congestion leads to higher shipping costs which could be passed onto downstream producers and consumers. Research in this area often uses aggregated monthly data on sea vessel shipping costs to analyze pass-through effects, limiting insights into whether specific import cost shocks (e.g., consumer imports or imports from a single exporting country) contribute more to the observed effects and omits potential pass through effects of shipping costs using other modes of transportation (e.g. air cargo). Such analysis could offer clarity for more accurate inflation forecasts and inspire further theoretical research into the causal links between supply chain congestion, shipping costs and inflation. Using monthly Census import data from 2002 to 2024, this paper analyzes pass through effects of import costs onto import, producer and consumer inflation. Using time-series local projection methods, I demonstrate that a 1 percentage point shock in annual growth rates of shipping charges per import transaction impacts consumer inflation for about 10 months, peaking at roughly 10 basis points 6 months after the shock — aligning with existing literature. I go on to show that pass through effects to PPI are higher and occur sooner than that for consumer products. I then exploit the granularity available in the data to show that shocks to shipping costs for consumer products, semiconductors, sea vessel shipping costs and imports from China significantly pass through to general PPI and CPI inflation.",step2,True
Improving the Acquisition of Spatial Graph and Survey Knowledge using Local and Global-Based Navigational Strategies,"Whether exploring unfamiliar and novel parts of a city or walking around a familiar neighborhood, spatial navigation is an essential skill that allows individuals to understand where salient landmarks exist and successfully navigate between both novel and learned locations. However, individuals exhibit varying ability and proficiency with respect to their spatial navigational skills, and the behavioral and functional mechanisms that may result in certain individuals being better navigators than others are not fully understood. One’s overall ability to successfully navigate can be constructed using three types of spatial representations: route knowledge (i.e., turn-by-turn sequences associated with landmarks), graph knowledge (i.e., a topologically constructed representation, focused on the understanding of specific locations within an environment and the path connections between them), and survey knowledge (i.e., a metrically-consistent cognitive map of salient landmarks within an environment).  Research has shown that the acquisition of graph and survey knowledge, respectively, requires much more effortful processing but results in a much more refined internal representation of one’s surroundings when compared to that of route knowledge (Chrastil &amp; Warren, 2014). Route knowledge, while typically easily acquired, limits the ability to navigate beyond that of previously traversed paths, while the more refined graph and survey knowledge increase flexibility and allow for novel shortcut-taking (Chrastil &amp; Warren, 2014). Although the acquisition of graph and survey knowledge may be more challenging than route knowledge, being provided and using explicit strategies that probe the learning and encoding of specific features within an environment may aid and further refine one’s navigation ability.  When exploring a novel environment, individuals may begin to acquire an internal representation of space through a more localized and area-specific approach or a more globalized and connectivity-emphasized approach. The local acquisition of spatial knowledge refers to the learning of landmarks on a specific route or area (Wen &amp; Kawabata, 2016). Using a more local-based strategy tends to facilitate the spatial acquisition of graph knowledge because it aids with the recognition of landmarks within a specified region of an environment (Wiener &amp; Mallot, 2003). According to previous studies, landmark distance estimation is underestimated within local regions and overestimated across different regions because the clustering of the landmarks is thought to take priority in hierarchal organizations of spatial representations (Hirtle &amp; Jonides, 1985). The global acquisition of spatial knowledge refers to the learning and synthesizing of different connections and paths to establish the overall relationship of all the landmarks within an environment. When comparing both types of spatial acquisition, a more local-based approach highlights how certain landmarks and features can be associated with one another or specific regions within an environment, whereas a more global-based approach emphasizes the construction of a graph-like representation through an environment’s paths and connections, and could also facilitate survey knowledge. 

The following study proposes to utilize the advantages of explicit strategies in traditional learning and encoding (e.g., enhancing the organization of novel information and recall ability), specifically during the exploration of a novel maze environment using immersive walking virtual reality. Ultimately, we aim to determine whether the use of local and global strategies during the exploration of a novel maze environment improves one’s overall navigation ability and to what extent these strategies translate to the acquisition of graph and survey knowledge. Participants will undergo an exploration phase followed by a test phase in the between-subjects experimental design. First, participants will randomly be assigned to one of three experimental groups: Painting Association strategy (i.e., local acquisition), Hallway Connections strategy (i.e., global acquisition), and No strategy (i.e., control). All participants are initially instructed to explore a maze environment containing 4 landmark paintings and 9 target objects placed within alcoves for 7 minutes. Participants in the Painting Association group are provided a strategy to group nearby target objects together based on proximity and to form associations with target objects to a nearby painting. Here, we aim to prime participants into learning the maze environment through the contents of multiple, localized regions, hence addressing local spatial acquisition. Participants in the Hallway Connections group are provided with a strategy that focuses on global spatial acquisition, where they are instructed to identify and connect main hallways with branches (i.e., sub-hallways), and how they connect to alcoves containing target objects. Participants using this global-focused strategy are probed to learn about the overall layout and connectivity of the maze environment. Participants in the control group are not provided with any strategy and will explore the maze without additional guidance. Following the exploration phase, all participants across the three groups will undergo the test phase consisting of a wayfinding task and a pointing task. During the pointing task, participants are asked to point between target object pairs in a blank environment without feedback (i.e., pointing between a visible, starting target object to where they believe the specified target object is). Participants then undergo a wayfinding task, where they are asked to navigate between target object pairs without feedback, using the maze’s hallways. The pointing task serves as a metric for how robust is one’s acquisition of survey knowledge by measuring signed and unsigned (absolute) angular errors between the target object pairs. Graph knowledge is assessed through the proportion of correct trials in which participants successfully navigate between target object pairs using the maze’s hallways. Ultimately, the following study aims to examine the extent to which explicit strategies probing the local and global acquisition of one’s surroundings when learning a novel maze environment aids in the acquisition of graph and survey knowledge. This knowledge may thus serve as a training mechanism to improve one’s navigation ability.",step2,True
Supported employment for people with developmental disabilities during COVID: A scoping review,"Methods

This scoping review is guided by the protocol framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley (2005) and is comprised of five phases. First, determining the research question sets the direction of the study (Arksey &amp; O'Malley, 2005). After that, Stage 2 entails a thorough review to find relevant research. Step 3 involves a meticulous selection of studies in line with the research goals. The organization and structuring of data taken from selected studies is the main goal of stage four. Last but not least, Stage 5 comprises compiling, analyzing, and presenting the findings in order to transform the data into insightful understandings (Arksey &amp; O'Malley, 2005). Together, this protocol provides a thorough framework for carrying out an organized and reliable research study. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) Checklist in reporting. The study does not require Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval since it is a scoping review.

Identifying the research question

The research question was built in PICO format. The populations of interest include: intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), Down Syndrome, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Cerebral Palsy, learning disability, Dyslexia, and Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The intervention under scrutiny is supported employment, explored in the context the COVID-19 pandemic. The outcome is the employment status of these individuals. Combining these components enabled creation of the initial search strategy, designed to answer our research question.

Identifying relevant studies

The literature search was conducted across four databases between December 2019 and November 2023 through EBSCO host: Medline, CINHAL, ERIC, and Web of Science. The search strategy was developed to capture the key components in the primary research question and with the rigor and specificity necessary for a PRISMA Systematic Review. The Boolean Operator OR was used to combine terms within each component and the Boolean Operator AND was used to combine components. Initial results were quite limited.. Therefore, due to the abundance of overlapping synonyms among the key terms related to population, interventions, and outcome, they were first combined using ""OR"" and then further refined by incorporating context using ""AND."" Keywords and medical subject headings (MeSH) related to the PICO question were used to compose the final search strategy: ((MH “Employment, Supported”) OR (MH “Rehabilitation, Vocational”) OR (MH “Employment”) OR (MH “Unemployment”) OR (“job development”) OR (“disability employment”) OR (MH “Return to Work”) OR (“job coaching”) OR (“employment services”) OR (employment support”) OR (“job placement”) OR (“community rehabilitation provider”) OR (“competitive integrated employment”) OR (“customized employment”) OR (MH “Communication Aids for Disabled”) OR (MH “Equipment and Supplies”) OR (MH “Telerehabilitation”) OR (MH “Remote Consultation”) OR (MH “Personnel Management”) OR (MH “Telemedicine”)) AND ((MH “Coronavirus Infections”) OR (MH “COVID-19”) OR (MH “pandemics”) OR (MH “SARS-CoV-2"") OR (“COVID”)).

Study selection

The inclusion criteria for participants encompass individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD), Down Syndrome, Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Learning Disability, Dyslexia, and ADHD. The study focuses on a broad age range, including individuals between the ages of 14 to 65. Additionally, only articles published in English are considered for inclusion in the review. The temporal scope of the study is limited to articles published from December 2019 to November 2023 considering COVID-19 focus. To maintain the specificity the following exclusion criteria was used. Firstly, research conducted outside the United States is excluded from consideration, ensuring a focus on the American context. Additionally, studies that do not specifically address supported employment are excluded. The scope is further refined by excluding research that focuses solely on physical disabilities or mental illnesses. Moreover, the exclusion of studies involving children aligns with the intended focus on the working population (ages 14 to 65). Finally, studies not related to the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those addressing Long COVID or H1N1, were excluded.

In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, data extraction was conducted independently by two reviewers using Covidence software (CITE) and screened for inclusion based on their title and abstract. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion between the reviewers to reach consensus. Next, the reviewers conducted independent hand searches to identify additional records, reviewed their eligibility, and met to establish consensus. Prior to formal data extraction, the extraction tool was piloted on a subset of included studies to ensure consistency and reliability in data extraction procedures. Data were extracted from the full text of each included study.

Charting the data

Data from the selected studies were charted using a spreadsheet adapted for this study. The subsequent crucial elements were extracted from each study: The author and year of publication, the study design, and the study characteristics (population, sample size, gender, race, age, exclusion/inclusion criteria, outcome measures), and main findings and analysis. The information extracted from the included studies was checked for accuracy and completeness by the second author.

Collating, summarizing, and reporting the results

In accordance with Arksey and O'Malley (2005), a basic descriptive analysis of the studies was conducted first. Next, an analytic framework was employed to present a thematic narrative of the included studies (Arksey &amp; O'Malley, 2005). Applying a consistent approach in summarizing and reporting the results helped in drawing conclusions from the reviewed studies, which might be difficult sometimes due to the differences between studies in designs and theoretical perspectives (Arksey &amp; O'Malley, 2005).",step2,True

Early Head Start Services as a Buffer of the Effects of Maternal Depression on Child Development,"Maternal depression, particularly during the first years of a child’s life, can have a significant negative impact on both the lives of the mother and child. Early Head Start (EHS), which serves nearly 185,000 families with young children across the United States, represents an excellent point of intervention to provide resources and referrals to caregivers who may be in need of them. As part of its ongoing mission to provide evidence-based early childhood services to families, ACF has issued a request for Secondary Analyses of Head Start and Early Head Start Data. GSURF, in collaboration with the Center of Excellence for Children’s Behavioral Health (COE) is proud to propose a study which will look at these issues from a developmental, systemic perspective and provide data-informed recommendations. 

COE proposes to analyze the 2009-2012 version of the Baby FACES study, which includes several years of longitudinal data, collected from a nationally representative sample of EHS families, to conduct a study which will support ACF in its mission to inform EHS policy on responding to maternal depression. COE proposes to conduct secondary analyses on the Baby FACES 2009-2012 data set in order to investigate two over-arching research areas, looking to see whether EHS services impact maternal depressive symptoms and whether changes in those symptoms influence children’s early developmental outcomes (e.g., cognitive and social-emotional development). COE will focus on how EHS policies and practices might promote health for both mother and child. COE proposes to leverage the longitudinal nature of the data and growth curve and structural equation modeling to search for factors that might influence the severity of depressive symptoms in mothers and might impact the relationship between depression and child development. 

COE is uniquely placed in Georgia to bring together research capacity with close relationships formed with “on the ground” state-level directors and other policymakers who can both inform this work and benefit from the recommendations that it produces. COE’s goal is to analyze the proposed research questions, conduct additional follow-up analysis where warranted, and provide data-driven policy recommendations on how EHS can be a force to promote the well-being of both mothers and children over the course of their involvement in the EHS program and beyond. By looking at points of contact at several levels of influence within an ecological model, COE will be able to provide recommendations that address the topic of maternal depression from the lens of the caregiver, EHS staff, EHS programs, and EHS policymakers.",step2,True

The Market for Leadership in Corporate Litigation,"Conventional wisdom has long held that leadership decisions in corporate litigation are best left to the lawyers. Even as the world of corporate litigation has changed dramatically, courts have consistently relied on the lawyers themselves to decide who among them will control litigation decisions. As a result, leadership decisions in corporate litigation are almost always made in private negotiations and back room deals. This Article pulls back the curtain on these decisions, using empirical data to conduct the first in-depth examination into the market for leadership in corporate litigation. This examination reveals a market that bears little resemblance to the ideal imagined by courts and commentators. The reliance on private ordering forces lawyers to agree to overly complicated leadership structures. These structures in turn cause lawyers to underinvest in litigation, encouraging holdouts and opportunism at the negotiating table. It need not be this way. Other types of complex litigation,from small-scale consumer class actions to multidistrict securities class actions, have successfully avoided such problems. The time has come for corporate law to draw on these insights and develop a new market for leader- ship in corporate litigation. In the end, leadership is far too important to be left to the lawyers.",step2,True
The Path Towards Green Transformation in Hainan's Manufacturing Sector,"Under the inevitable choice of China's ""dual carbon"" strategy and ecological civilization construction, Hainan Province's free trade port adheres to green development. The green transformation of manufactory in Hainan Province is also active. Green transformation is influenced by multiple factors and involves the entire manufacturing cycle. Thus, this article first sorted out the 31 major categories of manufacturing in Hainan, calculated the average energy consumption of manufacturing enterprises above a certain scale, and obtained the basic situation of manufacturing enterprises in Hainan Province. This article also uses literature review to analyze the specific path of green transformation in Hainan Province's manufacturing industry from three aspects: government policies, industrial structure, and energy consumption. The research results found that there is a clear trend of green transformation in the manufacturing industry in Hainan Province. This article suggests that Hainan Province should expand the positive impact of policies such as free trade ports, promote digital and intelligent development, and continuously adjust industrial institutions.",step2,True

Vertical Boilerplate,"Despite what we learn in law school about the “meeting of the minds,” most contracts are merely boilerplate—take-it-or-leave-it propositions. Negotiation is nonexistent; we rely on our collective market power as consumers to regulate contracts’ content. But boilerplate imposes certain information costs because it often arrives late in the transaction and is hard to understand. If those costs get too high, then the market mechanism fails. So how high are boilerplate’s information costs? A few studies have attempted to measure them, but they all use a “horizontal” approach—i.e., they sample a single stratum of boilerplate and assume that it represents the whole transaction. Yet real-world transactions often involve multiple layers of contracts, each with its own information costs. What is needed, then, is a “vertical” analysis, a study that examines fewer contracts of any one kind but tracks all the contracts the consumer encounters, soup to nuts. This Article presents the first vertical study of boilerplate. It casts serious doubt on the market mechanism and shows that existing scholarship fails to appreciate the full scale of the information cost problem. It then offers two regulatory solutions. The first works within contract law’s unconscionability doctrine, tweaking what the parties need to prove and who bears the burden of proving it. The second, more radical solution involves forcing both sellers and consumers to confront and minimize boilerplate’s information costs—an approach I call “forced salience.” In the end, the boilerplate experience is as deep as it is wide. Our empirical work should reflect that fact, and our policy proposals should too.",step2,True
Housing Tenure and Residential Segregation in Metropolitan America,"Abstract
               Homeownership, a symbol of the American dream, is one of the primary ways through which families accumulate wealth, particularly for blacks and Hispanics. Surprisingly, no study has explicitly documented the segregation of minority owners and renters from whites. Using data from Census 2000, this study aims to fill this gap. Analyses here reveal that the segregation of black renters relative to whites is significantly lower than the segregation of black owners from whites, controlling for relevant socioeconomic and demographic factors, contrary to the notion that homeownership represents an endpoint in the residential assimilation process. The patterns for Hispanics and Asians conform more to expectations under the spatial assimilation model. The findings here suggest that race and ethnicity continue to be as important in shaping residential segregation as socioeconomic status, and raise concerns about the benefits of homeownership, particularly for blacks.",step2,True
Trade and environment: evidence from China's manufacturing sector,"AbstractThis paper focusing on the Chinese manufacturing sector assesses the environmental impact of trade liberalization in China. The results show that China's experience with the trade liberalization–environment nexus is consistent with international evidence. On one hand, trade liberalization has had various positive effects on the environment. Firstly, it promoted specialization in areas of comparative advantage, which, in general, included industries that contributed less to environmental degradation. Secondly, it allowed China to access and adopt the best international practices in pollution abatement technology. Thirdly, it enabled China to transfer environmental costs to other countries by importing intermediate products whose production contributed to environmental degradation. On the other hand, these positive effects were overwhelmed by a negative scale effect, which was the result of a huge increase in the demand for Chinese exports. The paper concludes that if China is to prevent pollution from reaching a critical threshold, environmental regulations need to be tightened.

Applying sample survey methods to clinical trials data,"AbstractThis paper outlines the utility of statistical methods for sample surveys in analysing clinical trials data. Sample survey statisticians face a variety of complex data analysis issues deriving from the use of multi‐stage probability sampling from finite populations. One such issue is that of clustering of observations at the various stages of sampling. Survey data analysis approaches developed to accommodate clustering in the sample design have more general application to clinical studies in which repeated measures structures are encountered. Situations where these methods are of interest include multi‐visit studies where responses are observed at two or more time points for each patient, multi‐period cross‐over studies, and epidemiological studies for repeated occurrences of adverse events or illnesses. We describe statistical procedures for fitting multiple regression models to sample survey data that are more effective for repeated measures studies with complicated data structures than the more traditional approaches of multivariate repeated measures analysis. In this setting, one can specify a primary sampling unit within which repeated measures have intraclass correlation. This intraclass correlation is taken into account by sample survey regression methods through robust estimates of the standard errors of the regression coefficients. Regression estimates are obtained from model fitting estimation equations which ignore the correlation structure of the data (that is, computing procedures which assume that all observational units are independent or are from simple random samples). The analytic approach is straightforward to apply with logistic models for dichotomous data, proportional odds models for ordinal data, and linear models for continuously scaled data, and results are interpretable in terms of population average parameters. Through the features summarized here, the sample survey regression methods have many similarities to the broader family of methods based on generalized estimating equations (GEE). Sample survey methods for the analysis of time‐to‐event data have more recently been developed and implemented in the context of finite probability sampling. Given the importance of survival endpoints in late phase studies for drug development, these methods have clear utility in the area of clinical trials data analysis. A brief overview of methods for sample survey data analysis is first provided, followed by motivation for applying these methods to clinical trials data. Examples drawn from three clinical studies are provided to illustrate survey methods for logistic regression, proportional odds regression and proportional hazards regression. Potential problems with the proposed methods and ways of addressing them are discussed. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",step2,True
African American Locational Attainment before the Civil Rights Era," The conventional wisdom is that due to intense discrimination, prior to the Civil Rights era blacks of all classes lived side by side. Individual socioeconomic status did not translate into improved locational outcomes according to this view. But several historical case studies suggest that upper–stratum blacks did indeed live in neighborhoods set apart from their poorer brethren. This study uses individual–level data from the 1910–1950 Public Use Microdata Samples to investigate how individual–level socioeconomic status translated into neighborhood–level outcomes for blacks. the study finds that among blacks, individual–level socioeconomic status played no role in determining residential proximity to whites. for blacks individual socioeconomic status was, however, an important determinant of other neighborhood outcomes.

Messaging on information reliability and media choice,"Modern authoritarian regimes care deeply about public opinion and go to great lengths to manipulate their publics to support their policies. This is particularly true in Russia, where the state devotes massive resources toward pro-regime propaganda (Hale 2021; Paul and Matthews 2016; Rozenas and Stukal 2019). Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, state-run media have been working overtime to cultivate support for the war–which the Russian government calls a “special military operation.”

On the Russia Watcher survey, we have been tracking Russian support for and beliefs about the war. We have also run a number of experiments to test Russians’ responses to propaganda about several events. Two early and yet unpublished results drive the current study. First, we have found that whether a person trusts the Russian government as a source of information about the special military operation moderates the effectiveness of propaganda. Second, statements from government officials tend to have much larger effects on public opinion than significant cultural figures regardless of the direction of that messaging.

We propose testing the degree to which information from within the regime about the unreliability of information from the Russian government can erode the public’s seemingly unflinching trust in it as an information source. To do so, we will utilize a recent statement by a Russian government official on a popular talk show calling on the Russian government to stop lying to the Russian people about the “special military operation.” We will divide respondents into four groups. The pure control group will not watch a video and instead will begin answering the outcome questions. The video control group will view a video clip from a Russian talk show about a neutral topic. The first treatment group will view a short video clip from a Russian talk show alleging that the West is spreading significant amounts of disinformation about the “special military operation” in Russia. The fourth will view the talk show clip where a government official criticized the dishonesty of the Russian government. Our expectation is that the statement about the dishonesty of the Russian government will make respondents less likely to trust state media and more likely to seek out information from non-state owned media outlets.",step2,True
Pediatric Hemorrhagic Shock Consensus Conference,"Trauma is the leading cause of pediatric mortality, potential years of life lost, and a significant medical cost in 
the developed world. (1,2) In addition, children have a higher incidence of mortality compared with adults. 
Mortality in children with traumatic hemorrhagic shock is 50% compared to 20-25% reported in adults. (3,4) 
Estimates indicate that there are 1,000 preventable traumatic deaths after injury in children per year in the US 
due to inadequate or delayed care. Recent retrospective and prospective observational studies indicate that 
resuscitation practices (appropriate blood product ratios and tranexamic acid (TXA) use) can dramatically 
reduce mortality in children with traumatic hemorrhagic shock. (5,6) Due to these alarming statistics, 
resuscitation and hemostatic strategies are a key target for standardization and subsequent investigation. 
However, clinical trial design surrounding this topic would be very difficult due to not only the lack of 
standardization in resuscitation approaches, transfusion strategies, utilization of hemostatic monitoring and 
adjuncts, but also the lack of agreed upon critical definitions and common data elements for study.
To address these challenges, we organized a multidisciplinary team of highly engaged international experts 
and key stakeholders to develop consensus statements on best practice based on the current literature, 
consensus statements on research priorities, and methods of dissemination and implementation of the 
conference proceedings. Consensus statements will be developed via a highly structured process to include 
using the Delphi Method. A panel of 21 international experts (USA, Canada, Europe, Israel) that represent 
trauma surgery, transfusion medicine/hematology, anesthesia, critical care, and emergency medicine will form 
the consensus committee. The conference will also lead to the generation of a multidisciplinary research 
network focused on improving outcomes for children with traumatic hemorrhagic shock.
Aim 1: Review the current state of the art for the management of pediatric traumatic hemorrhagic 
shock. 
To achieve this aim, one full day of lectures will be used to review and discuss in detail current knowledge in 
the biology of traumatic hemorrhagic shock, methods to monitor shock and its consequences, hemorrhage 
control methods, and resuscitation practice patterns and outcomes in this population. Lectures will also include 
the importance of collecting common data elements, structure of a pediatric trauma resuscitation research 
network, and the Delphi Method for consensus statement generation. 
Aim 2: Develop evidence-based informed consensus statements for the management of pediatric 
traumatic hemorrhagic shock. 
To achieve this aim, we will use the Delphi Method process to create consensus recommendations for best 
practices for the management of pediatric traumatic hemorrhagic shock. Specific topics for discussion will 
include the use of tourniquets, prehospital blood use, transfusion and hemostatic adjunct strategies, 
hemostasis monitoring, airway and blood pressure management.
Aim 3: Develop a consensus statement on research priorities. 
To achieve this aim, consensus statements will be developed that describe the mission and goals for a 
pediatric trauma resuscitation research network. Consensus statements will also be generated on specific 
research topics that need to be prioritized for the development of clinical trials. Recognizing the paucity of 
literature on many important topics in pediatric traumatic shock resuscitation, current knowledge gaps and 
research priorities in this population will be identified that will be critical to improving patient care. 
Aim 4: Develop a robust dissemination and implementation methods for consensus statements 
generated and for the results of future trials.
To achieve this aim, we will collaborate with experts in the field of dissemination and implementation to 
develop methods that are optimal for the pediatric trauma community. Methods will include publishing a 
supplement in Pediatric Critical Care that summarizes the conference proceedings. Other methods such as the 
development of decision support tools, and the use of video conferencing and social media venues will be 
explored. The use of the dissemination and implementation tools established during the conference will be 
incorporated by the newly formed pediatric trauma resuscitation research network to change practice based on 
the evidence it generates. This network will begin multi-institutional collaboration to study generated research 
questions and maintain its framework and momentum with regular conference calls and yearly meetings.

Consensus Methods: A “medical consensus” is a public statement on a particular aspect of medical 
knowledge that is generally agreed upon as an evidence-based, state-of-the art knowledge by a representative
group of experts in that area. (20) A specific method to commonly used to establish consensus is the Delphi 
Method. To begin the process of developing consensus, the planning committee has agreed upon important 
topics (listed in agenda) that the consensus committee will discuss with the goal of generating consensus 
statements. Lectures during day 1 of the conference will cover these topics in detail to inform the discussion
within the consensus committee. In addition, the planning committee will collect the current literature on 
consensus topics in a systematic approach and share as a pre-meeting packet to the consensus committee for review at least one month prior to this meeting. Members of the planning committee will perform scoping and 
systematic reviews with formal guidance from library science experts (UAB Library Services). Searches for all 
literature pertinent to the consensus statements, will use a Boolean approach that will take into account the 
keywords in the PICOS domains (21, 22): P (population), I (intervention), C (comparator), O (outcome), S 
(study design). In each instance, the librarian will search at least in PubMed, Medline and the Cochrane 
Library. Thereafter, two members of the consensus committee will independently select relevant papers 
through Covidence software. Retained papers will be used to write the first draft of one or multiple summaries 
and a first draft of recommendation(s) for the topics by the primary lecturer on the topic, using the GRADE 
methodology. (23-27) Although we will not be publishing formal systematic reviews, identical search methods 
and methodology to select the relevant literature will be carried out to provide the most relevant, current 
literature on which to base our consensus statements and discussion. 
The consensus statement development will be initially drafted by the faculty lecturer on the topic and
will then be voted on by all members of the consensus committee utilizing the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness 
Methodology, a method developed to combine the best available scientific evidence with the collective 
judgement of the experts. All experts rate the consensus statement on a Likert scale (1=disagreement, 
9=strong agreement). The highest and lowest scores are discarded followed by calculation of the median and 
range. The median value determines how the recommendation is categorized: agreement (median=7-9), 
equipoise (median=4-6), or disagreement (median=1-3). The range (remaining lowest and highest values) 
determines if the recommendation is “strong” or “weak.” (28) If there is not agreement, those not in agreement 
can aid discussion to amend statement to facilitate agreement until voting can occur on the adjusted 
statement. If there is not consensus after three votes, the faculty lecturer will moderate discussion to develop 
changes from audience feedback to attempt to gain consensus. If after 5 total cycles of voting, there is no 
consensus, we will publish consensus could not be obtained. Two hours will be allotted for each topic.",step2,True
Matching Methods for Causal Inference with Time‐Series Cross‐Sectional Data,"AbstractMatching methods improve the validity of causal inference by reducing model dependence and offering intuitive diagnostics. Although they have become a part of the standard tool kit across disciplines, matching methods are rarely used when analysing time‐series cross‐sectional data. We fill this methodological gap. In the proposed approach, we first match each treated observation with control observations from other units in the same time period that have an identical treatment history up to the prespecified number of lags. We use standard matching and weighting methods to further refine this matched set so that the treated and matched control observations have similar covariate values. Assessing the quality of matches is done by examining covariate balance. Finally, we estimate both short‐term and long‐term average treatment effects using the difference‐in‐differences estimator, accounting for a time trend. We illustrate the proposed methodology through simulation and empirical studies. An open‐source software package is available for implementing the proposed methods.",step2,True

"Fertility Intentions, Support and Embodiment","Instigated by declining rates in fertility worldwide, publications on fertility across academic disciplines have increased dramatically (Nagaratnam et al., 2016). Current literature has shown a gap between fertility intention and fertility outcomes (Harknett &amp; Hartnett, 2014; Beaujouan &amp; Berghammer, 2019). By measuring retrospective fulfillment, we want to explore whether this gap is meaningful on an individual level. How has the changing landscape of fertility and social networks affected individual and community-level circumstances affecting reproduction decisions? Are people’s fertility intentions fulfilled? This study explores how community and individual circumstances influence reproductive decision-making. Specifically, whether individuals fulfilled their fertility intentions and how financial, practical, and emotional forms of social support and embodiment may influence this. We draw upon evolutionary frameworks, focusing on cooperative child rearing, and kinship combined with an embodiment framework in our exploration of reproductive decision-making. Together, the kin influence hypothesis and cooperative childrearing models emphasize the importance of social networks in reproductive decision-making (Newson et al., 2005). As society changes, we want to investigate how our social support systems affect fertility intentions. A feminist embodiment framework can be used to acknowledge the reciprocal relationship between the body, social systems, and mental processes. We can define embodiment as an alternative to a dualistic understanding of human beings by referring to how we experience and understand the world ‘through our bodies’ (Merleau-Ponty, 1962). This considers culture, history, society, and relationships referencing conscious and unconscious influences that make up our experience. We use this framework to identify another source that shapes our reproductive decisions. In isolation, the explanatory power of social support or embodiment is limited. We propose that together, these sources will offer more explanatory power and insight into fertility intentions than in isolation. These relationships will be tested using mixed methods: an online survey and semi-structured interviews.",step2,True

Study on stakeholders position and role in supply chain of cocoa commodities,"The quality and continuity of cocoa beans supply is determined really stakeholders in related to the cocoa supply chain. In general, the activity of cocoa beans production has not been efficient yet to compete as raw materials for domestic and foreign industries. In order for cocoa commodities in West Sulawesi Province can compete and increase the income of cocoa farmers, so it is necessary to increase the role of main stakeholders and to support the cocoa supply chain especially those support the improvement of cocoa beans productivity. The objective of study is to analyse the position and role of stakeholder in the cocoa bean supply chain. The method used to identify the stakeholders' position / structure is Interpretative Structural Modelling (ISM) method, and the role of stakeholders by survey method is to identify the cocoa bean supply chain that becomes the object of research. The results of the study indicate that famers are the most important stakeholders who need to get the attention of other stakeholders in the sustainability of the cocoa supply chain. Marketing institutions (collectors, wholesalers, processing industries, exporters), government / agricultural extension workers, still have few roles in the supply chain of cocoa commodities. The roles as expected of marketing institutions are partnership especially price guarantees and costs support of increasing farmers' garden productivity.

"Neighborhood Immigrant Concentration, Interview Language, and Survey Nonresponse in the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)"," Using restricted data from 2011 to 2014, this study examines whether neighborhood immigrant concentration and survey interview language are associated with participation in the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). The findings show that survey participation in the NCVS during the study period did not differ appreciably among households and persons sampled from neighborhoods with larger shares of immigrants. This suggests that the NCVS can contribute meaningfully to knowledge about the relationship between neighborhood immigrant concentration and levels of crime, providing an important complement to studies based on crime data collected by law enforcement agencies. Interview language had a minimal impact on nonresponse among Hispanic respondents in the NCVS, but the study revealed much higher rates of nonresponse across waves among Asian household respondents who completed the NCVS in a non-English language, especially among those from neighborhoods with relatively low immigrant concentration. This suggests that greater translation support for Asian respondents could increase NCVS response rates. Replicating and extending our research with more recent NCVS data, and incorporating the new item on citizenship status, would be valuable given the continued growth in the immigrant population, increased share of immigrants who routinely speak a language other than English at home, and social and political changes that have corresponded with observed reductions in nonresponse in government-administered surveys. We encourage the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) to facilitate such research by routinely making the restricted NCVS data available for researchers to use within the nation’s Federal Statistical Research Data Centers and by adding interview language as a permanent fixture of the data.

Predicting Higher Education Enrollment Among Immigrant Descendants Using Random Forest,"Across many countries, students with an immigration background tend to complete less schooling than their non-immigrant peers (OECD, 2023a). Highly educated individuals tend to exhibit increased civic engagement, along with elevated employment rates and relative earnings (OECD, 2023a). Thus, immigrant students’ low enrollment rates in higher education may ultimately lead to a lower societal status. This is a concerning issue, given the increasing number of immigrant adolescents globally and the expected growth in immigration in the future (OECD, 2013). As a result, addressing the achievement gap among immigrant students is a top priority for politicians, social scientists, and the general public (Appel et al., 2015).
In South Korea (hereafter referred to as Korea), the university education system has undergone significant expansion to provide sufficient university seats for all high school graduates (Kim et al., 2018). And it is common for students to pursue tertiary education immediately after finishing their upper secondary education. The 2022 OECD survey has highlighted that Korea boasts the world's highest tertiary education attainment rate among young people (aged 25-34), with an impressive 69.29%. In comparison, the OECD global average is 47.4% (OECD, 2023b). The high percentage in Korea is attributed to the prevailing belief that increasing one's level of education typically results in better employment prospects and higher income levels (OECD, 2022). In 2020, the relative earnings of Korean workers, based on their educational achievements (with the wage of a high school graduate as the reference point set at 100), stood at 110.2% for college graduates, 138.3% for university graduates, and 182.3% for those holding graduate degrees (OECD, 2022).¹ However, immigrant descendants exhibit a significantly lower admission rate in higher education than native students. Table 1 (see File 1) compares the enrollment rates of students with an immigration background to those of the general population across different school levels. While there is not a significant difference in enrollment rates from elementary to high school, it is evident that there is a substantial gap in enrollment rates at the higher education level. The disparity in enrollment rates was 14.8% in 2015, 18% in 2018, and 31% in 2021, demonstrating a widening gap over time (Korean Ministry of Education &amp; Korean Educational Development Institute, 2021). Nevertheless, no research has yet uncovered the cause of this phenomenon.
It has been highlighted that the admission of immigrant descendants into higher education is constrained by language barriers, cultural disparities, lack of information on education policy and limited support due to economic disadvantages (Yang et al., 2020). However, it's important to note that no research has been conducted on these issues in Korea. South Korea's policy for assisting families with an immigration background has mainly focused on the initial settlement of immigrants. The present requirement calls for the practical support needed for children of families with an immigration background after they have settled. This study investigates the variables influencing higher education access among immigrant descendants and assesses their significance using Random Forest, a machine-learning approach. The research questions are as follows: 
(1)	What is the order of importance of the variables influencing access to higher education among immigrant descendants?
(2)	How does each variable influence access to higher education among immigrant descendants?
There have been studies on the determinants of access to higher education among non-immigrant students (Chan &amp; Hu, 2023; Kim, 2008b). However, these studies often lacked a comprehensive analysis and understanding as a selection of individual, family, and school-related variables were considered separately. Additionally, there has been an absence of research on access to higher education for immigrant descendants in Korea because there was no available data regarding this population. This is because the surge in the immigrant population in Korea predominantly occurred in the 1990s, resulting in their descendants representing a pioneering generation of students with an immigration background who are pursuing higher education in the 2020s. This study focuses on examining the variables that impact access to higher education, offering valuable insights into supporting immigrant descendants. If variables related to predetermined conditions beyond individual control or actions affect access to higher education, the possibility of social mobility through their own efforts diminishes (Kim, 2008b). Therefore, exploring the variables that influence students' decisions to pursue higher education from the perspective of educational inequality is of great importance. 
Studies investigating the variables that impact higher education admissions or choices, as well as the motivations of high school students to pursue higher education, have been consistently carried out in various countries. Nevertheless, these variables have seldom been systematically ranked or organized according to their respective degrees of importance. 
Perna's (2006) conceptual model (see Figure 1 in File 1) offered a comprehensive perspective of students' college decision-making. The framework integrated two key paradigms in this topic: human capital investment (Becker, 1962, 1993; Long, 2004) and sociological-cultural approaches (Hearn, 1984, 1988; McDonough, 1997). It assumed that four contextual nested layers influence an individual's college choice decisions: (1) the individual's habitus, (2) the school and community context (organizational habitus), (3) the higher education context, and (4) the social, economic, and policy context. Due to data collection limitations, our study only concentrated on the first (individual habitus) and second (organizational habitus) layers of the model that are more directly related to college choice. We have drawn various associated variables with these two layers from previous studies and reclassified the variables into individual, family, and school-related variables based on their sources.
By investigating these variables comprehensively, the findings of the study provide important information regarding immigrant students' access to higher education. This information is useful for reducing the likelihood of growing educational disparities between immigrant descendants and native students, as well as addressing concerns related to the potential widening of future social class gaps.",step2,True

A study on public attitudes towards China's high-skilled immigration policy reform,"Currently, the global competition for technological talent is intensifying。The shortage of international talent not only affects the research and development process in high-tech fields but also hinders industrial transformation and the optimization of economic structures. Moreover, public attitudes toward high-tech immigration are crucial as these directly impact the implementation and effectiveness of policies. With the development of economic globalization, an increasing number of foreigners are choosing to study, work, or even settle in China, which has sparked social dissatisfaction, with topics such as special treatment for international students and the African immigrant community in Guangzhou frequently triggering online criticism. In February 2020, China's Ministry of Justice released the ""Draft Regulations on the Permanent Residence of Foreigners in the People's Republic of China,"" which ignited negative public sentiment. Chinese scholars believe that there are still gaps in the policy system, admission standards, social security and living services, and the actual development and introduction of high-level talent (Liu Yungang &amp; Chen Yue, 2015).

The introduction of high-tech immigrants is dependent not only on policy formulation and execution but also significantly on social acceptance. Public attitudes towards high-tech immigrants can significantly affect the effective implementation of policies and the success of foreign talent recruitment. First, public attitudes directly influence the attraction and retention of foreign high-tech talents. A positive social acceptance environment can make foreign talents feel welcomed, increasing their satisfaction with working and living in China, thereby encouraging more high-tech talents to choose to develop their careers in China. Conversely, if the public holds xenophobic or hostile attitudes, potential high-tech talents may have reservations about living and working in China, reducing their willingness to come. Second, public attitudes decisively affect the level of support for policies. Broad public support for high-tech immigration policies can facilitate the smooth implementation of these policies, providing the government with greater operational space and social legitimacy. For example, if the public widely believes that the introduction of foreign high-tech talents significantly contributes to national technological development, the government will receive more societal support when formulating more open immigration policies. On the other hand, if the public opposes, it may increase resistance during policy implementation, possibly leading to policy adjustments or changes. Moreover, public attitudes also play a crucial role in shaping China's international image and relations. How China handles and reflects public attitudes toward high-tech immigration directly influences the international community's perception of China's openness and inclusiveness.",step2,True
Outside options in households of Mbendjele BaYaka,"Distribution of tasks for the successful running of households (complementary coordination) are subject to many factors. In this study, we investigate the role of outside options in determining the repartition of tasks between men and women.  

(data analysis and modeling plans were updated; and new specifications can be found on: https://osf.io/b7nse)

Distributing household tasks in a complementary fashion increases efficiency, providing a fitting example of complementary coordination e.g. if one cooks and cleans, the other does the house repairs. The output of complementary coordination - a successfully running household - is beneficial to both parties. However, the inputs must be divided in an asymmetric manner.

We predict that this distribution, within the possible degree of flexibility, will be dependent on what outside options the respective parties have. More specifically, the individual having better outside options (measured by relational wealth) will enjoy advantage in the division of coordination strategies (measured by their daily leisure time). This analysis can be made within the couple (between sex) and between couples (within sex). In the former, gendered sex roles and traditions will need to be controlled for. In the latter, the household size and composition will need to be controlled for.

We analyze ethnographic data of hunter-gatherer camps from the Central African Republic and Northern Republic of Congo to test our hypotheses. The population is known as Mbendjele BaYaka. They are semi-nomadic people, following an immediate-return economic system, because of which they do not have any accumulated resources or means of financial income. Their main form of wealth in these societies is their social wealth - measured in terms of relations and popularity within camp (Woodburn, 1982). This will be the measure of our independent variable, outside options. They engage in demand sharing, wherein everyone has the right to demand access to material objects and equal sharing, bringing about egalitarianism in the group. Both males and females have active political voice and decision-making power in marriage. There is emphasis on personal autonomy, making it a good fit for our hypothesis - an individual’s outside options weigh on their bargaining power. The influence of conventional gendered norms in household coordination pose a major confound to our hypothesis, which gets removed in this population of egalitarian hunter-gatherers.",step2,True
"Reallocation, Firm Dynamics, and Productivity Growth: Evidence from Eswatini’s Manufacturing Sector","Abstract
        See mansucript PDF file for abstract with equation
This article investigates the contributions of real productivity, firm-size rationalization, and net-entry effects to aggregate labour productivity (ALP) growth using a panel dataset from Eswatini’s manufacturing sector. It compares these results with what obtains in world economies at different stages of development. After controlling for extreme values, it found a persistent annual average increase of 2.67% in real productivity. The sector also experienced labour reallocation gains of 0.26% from incumbents and suffered losses of 0.43% from the entry/exit margins. Thus, within-firm effects dominated the intensive and extensive forms of labour input reallocation a fortiori. Further, cross-sectional distributions of up-to the fourth-order moment of labour shortages were used as sources of exogenous variation in endogenous aggregate employment growth when estimating the impact of the latter on reallocation. The first-order moment was strongly associated with changes in aggregate employment growth while higher-order moments had insignificant effects. In contrast, the reshuffling of labour among incumbents and across sectors was robustly unresponsive to variations in aggregate employment growth. However, a unit percentage point increase in aggregate employment growth from a Two Stage Least Squares (TSLS) estimator inversely varied with net-entry effects at the rate of β̂ 𝑇𝑆𝐿𝑆𝜖(-0.976, -0.926), depending on model specification.

A cross-institutional analysis of the effects of broadening trainee professional development on research productivity,"PhD-trained scientists are essential contributors to the workforce in diverse employment sectors that include academia, industry, government, and non-profit organizations. Hence, best practices for training the future biomedical workforce are of national concern. Complementing coursework and laboratory research training, many institutions now offer professional training that enables career exploration and develops a broad set of skills critical to various career paths. The National Institutes of Health funded academic institutions to design innovative programming to enable this professional development through a mechanism known as Broadening Experiences in Scientific Training (BEST). Programming at the BEST awardee institutions included career panels, skill-building workshops, job-searching workshops, site visits, and internships. Because doctoral training is lengthy and requires focused attention on dissertation research, an initial concern was that students participating in additional complementary training activities might exhibit an increased time to degree or diminished research productivity. Metrics were analyzed from ten BEST awardee institutions to address this concern, using time to degree and publication records as measures of efficiency and productivity. Comparing doctoral students who participated to those who did not, results revealed that across these diverse academic institutions, there were no differences in time to degree or manuscript output. Furthermore, a few institutions demonstrated a positive correlation between participation in career and professional development activities and productivity. Our findings support the policy that doctoral students should participate in career and professional development opportunities that are intended to prepare them for a variety of diverse and important careers in the workforce.

Firm Dynamics and Trade," We review the literature that studies the dynamics of firms in foreign markets, at both the intensive and extensive margins, and their aggregate implications. We first summarize a set of micro facts on exporter entry, expansion, contraction, and exit and several macro facts about the response of aggregate trade flows to trade-policy and business-cycle shocks. We then present the canonical model developed to account for these facts and discuss its connection to the empirical evidence. We show how three model features—future uncertain profits, an investment in market access, and high depreciation of that access upon exit—generate transition dynamics and long-run aggregate outcomes from a cut in tariffs. The model and its extensions contribute to our understanding of trade integration and the evolution of future trade barriers. We discuss the key challenges faced by the canonical model, its possible extensions, and applications of the framework to recent global events. ",step2,True
Precursors of the Commutative Principle in Preschoolers,"In a previous study, we showed that 2nd grade children do not spontaneously perceive that 3 groups of 2 dots and 2 groups of 3 dots contain the same number of dots, even if they know that 3x2 and 2x3 are equal. They, however, exhibit a better understanding of the commutativity of addition. A possible explanation for these findings is that, as opposed to addition, the symmetry in commutative multiplication directly appears only in the symbolic format, while linguistic and visuo-spatial  non-symbolic representations, such as seeing or saying “2 groups of 3 dots”, involve two levels of  embedding that make them harder to interpret. In other words, the commutative principle in additive contexts is intrinsically one-dimensional (1D), while it is arguably intrinsically two-dimensional (2D) in multiplication. The proposed study aims at investigating the existence of precursors of the understanding of the commutative principle in preschoolers, and the type of representations (geometric, linguistic, etc.) that  preferentially support them. 
To do so, 5-year-old children are presented with various situations in which they are asked to judge whether two characters got a fair or an unfair share of apples. Each trial thus presents a pair of sets of apples, that probes children’s understanding of commutative multiplication (with simple grouping such as 3 groups of 2 apples versus 2 groups of 3 apples, or using rectangular displays in both horizontal and vertical orientations), and control it against commutative addition and mere identity, as well as all their unequal counterparts. To assess the influence of language, each situation is presented first without any linguistic cues, and then accompanied by a full linguistic description.",step2,True
Explaining prosecution outcomes for cryptocurrency-based financial crimes,"Cryptocurrencies have been used to commit various offences, but enforcement efforts remain underdeveloped relative to the value of these crimes.

We used bivariate analyses and logistic regression models to determine relationships among these variables.  The presence of individual defendants only (rather than a corporate defendant or combination thereof) and the use of only a cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin in committing a crime each made a case less likely to be resolved by dismissal, trial, or summary or default judgment. This paper is the first to examine variables contributing to financial crime prosecution outcomes and has implications for prosecutorial decision-making, resource allocation, and the prevention and detection of financial offences involving cryptocurrencies.",step2,True

Algorithmic Choice and Collusion,"The increased popularity of (self-learning) pricing algorithms has raised concerns regarding the possibility that those algorithms could learn to collude tacitly on non-competitive prices. This has been substantiated by initial research (e.g., Calvano et al., 2020; Klein, 2021), which suggests that such algorithmic collusion poses significant challenges in purely algorithmic markets. However, the dynamics of these algorithmic markets in comparison to those with human actors remain less explored. Existing studies either contrast algorithmic with human collusion within significantly different market environments (Calvano et al., 2020) or analyze market data to distinguish between the two, sacrificing the controlled environment necessary for understanding the underlying mechanisms (Assad et al., 2020).
Moreover, the interaction between algorithmic and human sellers in the same marketplace, observed in sectors like online product sales on platforms like Amazon (L. Chen et al., 2016) and the gasoline market (Assad et al., 2020), and findings on algorithmic and human collusion in isolation might not be indicative for outcomes in markets with a mixed composition. While there is first evidence of collusion in these ""mixed"" markets, those studies usually focus on algorithms that allow for collusion by design and are not self-learning (Normann and Sternberg, 2021).
Addressing this gap, Werner (2023) provides novel insights into the extent of the problem posed by self-learning algorithmic collusion in contrast to traditional human-driven markets through a controlled experimental setup. This study investigates the interactions between pricing algorithms and human sellers across various market compositions. Participants are assigned specific roles wherein they must either completely delegate their pricing decisions to an algorithm or set prices independently, without the ability to choose whether they want to adopt an algorithm. Overall, evidence suggests that self-learning algorithms may enable tacit collusion more effectively than humans (Calvano et al., 2020; Klein, 2021; Werner, 2023). Additionally, existing literature highlights a tendency for algorithm aversion among users, who show a preference for maintaining control over imperfect algorithms, even though these algorithms frequently outperform human decision-making (Dietvorst et al., 2018).
Our research builds upon the existing body of literature to provide insights into the dynamics of adopting self-learning algorithms for pricing decisions and their impact on pricing outcomes in a Bertrand market. Specifically, we aim to obtain insights on whether and to what extent firms will delegate pricing, either partially or completely, to algorithms and how this affects market prices and potential collusion levels. 
To assess these questions, a between-subject design will be applied, in which each participant only plays one treatment. Participants are divided into three treatment groups: the first without the choice to use pricing algorithms, the second with the choice to fully delegate pricing decisions to a self-learning algorithm, and the third with the choice of access to algorithmic price recommendations while retaining decision-making autonomy. 
The self-learning pricing algorithm, consistent across all treatments and participants, follows the model presented in Werner (2023). In the treatments where participants have the option to either delegate their pricing decisions or receive algorithmic price recommendations, they are provided with comprehensive information about the algorithm's objectives and past performance. In all treatments, participants have the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the pricing process during a simulation round, where the other firm is played by the algorithm.
Our lab experiment, programmed in oTree (D. L. Chen et al., 2016), involves about 300 participants in five super games to allow for learning of the participants, simulating a Bertrand market with two firms selling homogenous goods. Within this market, each firm has to set prices ranging from 0 to 5 to sixty computerized consumers, each willing to purchase one unit during each period, with a maximum willingness to pay of 4. Each round has a continuation probability of 95%. The group matching will be held constant within each super game. Across super games, participants will be rematched into two-firm markets within matching groups of 10. 
The super games conclude with participants incentivized to disclose their beliefs regarding their counterparts' use of algorithms. Additionally, participants will complete questionnaires to evaluate algorithm aversion, demographic factors, and measures of risk, trust, and reciprocity.",step2,True

We examine differences in turnout depending on birth order, using unique population-wide individual level register data from Sweden and Norway that enables precise within-family estimates. We consistently find that higher birth order entails lower turnout, and that the turnout differential with respect to birth order is stronger when turnout is lower.

Methodology,"A quasi-experimental design will be implemented, forming an experimental group that will participate in an intervention program for the development of metacognitive strategies, and a control group that will perform a distractor task. Participation of students in both groups will be voluntary, and random assignment to groups will be carried out.  The intervention will consist of training in the application of metacognitive strategies to enable proper use of AI and improve well-being. Students in the experimental and control groups will need to solve a practical case related to their area of specialization using Artificial Intelligence. To address this case, students will perform tasks such as writing, decision-making, reading comprehension, creativity, and innovation.  The sample will comprise students enrolled in the 2024/2025 academic year, in their first year of studies in Nursing, Physiotherapy, Podiatry, Primary Education, Early Childhood Education, Pedagogy, and Social Education (approximately 400 students). The independent variable will be the presence or absence of the metacognitive strategies intervention, and the tasks to be performed by the student with the help of AI; while the dependent variables will be teacher-assigned grades for activities, metacognitive awareness, digital competencies, well-being, and academic stressors. 

To evaluate these, the following instruments will be used: 
- Metacognitive Awareness Inventory - MAI (Schraw &amp; Dennison, 1994), Digital Competence Test - IKANOS (Panchurco et al., 2022), Academic Stressors Scale - ECEA (Cabanach et al., 2016), and the Mental Health Continuum Short Form - MHC-SF (Keyes, 2002).  

Instruments and Materials: Resolution of a case where students will need to perform writing, decision-making, assimilation and comprehension of content, creativity, and innovation. This task will be evaluated using the scores proposed by the teacher.  
- Metacognitive Strategies Development Kit: Comprising tutorials and worksheets designed by the project team and adapted to the needs of the student profile.  
- Metacognition: The Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (MAI) adapted to Spanish, available on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/zthdj). It has 52 items, using the response scale proposed by Harrison and Vallin (2018) to reduce acquiescence bias (Likert scale from 5 = “very typical of me” to 1 = “not at all typical of me”). Previous studies have shown high reliability levels for the different proposed scales (alpha = .66-.88) (Abdelrahman, 2020; Harrison &amp; Vallin, 2018; Muis et al., 2007; Schraw &amp; Dennison, 1994).  
- Digital Competencies: Digital Competence Test - IKANOS (Panchurco et al., 2022): An information collection tool that includes descriptors of the digComp framework validated by the European Commission in 2013. This self-administered instrument consists of 30 items related to the five competency areas analyzed by digComp (information, communication, content creation, safety, and problem-solving). Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = rarely or never, 2 = rarely or almost never, 3 = sometimes, 4 = frequently or almost always, 5 = very frequently or always). Cronbach's alpha for each dimension ranged between 0.63 and 0.783. This scale has no upper limit; the higher the person's score in each area, the greater their competence in that area. 
- Academic Stressors: The Academic Stressors Scale (ECEA). Measures the stress potential of different conditions in the academic context. Likert scale with scores ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always), composed of seven dimensions: methodological deficiencies of the teaching staff (DEFMET), academic overload of the student (SOBACA), beliefs about academic performance (CRENREN), public speaking (INTPUB), negative social climate (CLINEG), exams (EXAM), lack of content value (CARVAL), and participation difficulties (DIFPAR) (Cabanach et al., 2016).  
- Mental Well-being: The Mental Health Continuum Short Form (MHC-SF) by Keyes (2002), derived from the long form (MHC-LF), which consists of 7 items measuring emotional well-being, 18 items measuring psychological well-being, and 15 items measuring social well-being (40 items in total). The short form consists of 14 items selected to represent each dimension of well-being. The short form includes 3 items for emotional well-being (reflecting hedonic well-being), 6 items for psychological well-being, and 5 items for social well-being (when combined, reflecting eudaimonic well-being). Response options evaluate the frequency with which respondents experience each positive mental health symptom. This scale also provides a mental health indicator based on these three subscales.  

Other possible measurement instruments: Hedonic well-being through the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) by Watson, D., Clark, L., &amp; Tellegen, A. (1988) and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) by Diener et al. (1985). Eudaimonic well-being through the Questionnaire for Eudaimonic Well-being (QEWB) by Waterman et al. (2010).

An End to Privacy Theater: Exposing and Discouraging Corporate Disclosure of User Data to the Government,"Today, when consumers evaluate potential telecommunications, Internet service or application providers – they are likely to consider several differentiating factors: The cost of service, the features offered as well as the providers’ reputation for network quality and customer service. The firms’ divergent approaches to privacy, and in particular, their policies regarding law enforcement and intelligence agencies’ access to their customers’ private data are not considered by consumers during the purchasing process – perhaps because it is practically impossible for anyone to discover this information. 

A naïve reader might simply assume that the law gives companies very little wiggle room – when they are required to provide data, they must do so. This is true. However, companies have a huge amount of flexibility in the way they design their networks, in the amount of data they retain by default, the exigent circumstances in which they share data without a court order, and the degree to which they fight unreasonable requests. As such, there are substantial differences in the privacy practices of the major players in the telecommunications and Internet applications market: Some firms retain identifying data for years, while others retain no data at all; some voluntarily provide government agencies access to user data - one carrier even argued in court that its 1st amendment free speech rights guarantee it the right to do so, while other companies refuse to voluntarily disclose data without a court order; some companies charge government agencies when they request user data, while others disclose it for free. As such, a consumer’s decision to use a particular carrier or provider can significantly impact their privacy, and in some cases, their freedom. 

Many companies profess their commitment to protecting their customers’ privacy, with some even arguing that they compete on their respective privacy practices. However, none seem to be willing to disclose, let alone compete on the extent to which they assist or resist government agencies’ surveillance activities. Because information about each firm’s practices is not publicly known, consumers cannot vote with their dollars, and pick service providers that best protect their privacy. 

In this article, I focus on this lack of information and on the policy changes necessary to create market pressure for companies to put their customers’ privacy first. I outline the numerous ways in which companies currently assist the government, often going out of their way to provide easy access to their customers’ private communications and documents. I also highlight several ways in which some companies have opted to protect user privacy, and the specific product design decisions that firms can make that either protect their customers’ private data by default, or make it trivial for the government to engage in large scale surveillance. Finally, I make specific policy recommendations that, if implemented, will lead to the public disclosure of these privacy differences between companies, and hopefully, create further market incentives for firms to embrace privacy by design.",step2,True
Experiments on Organizational Climate and Knowledge Disclosure,"The leakage of a firm’s proprietary knowledge erode a major source of an organization’s competitive advantage and constitute a serious threat to its survival and prosperity. It is hence reasonable to expect organizations to put in place protection mechanisms that shield them against such threat. Most of prior literature has tended to focus on the role of formal protection mechanisms, such as legal barriers and financial incentives. The rationale is to align the employee’s individual goals with those of the organization by acting on extrinsic motivation. In conformity with a more elaborated view of human motivation, recent work has started to look at how firms can employ informal protection mechanisms that act upon an individual’s intrinsic motivation not to disclose organizational knowledge. In this research project, I extend this literature by examining the role of organizational climate. In particular, I claim that  organizations can leverage on a favorable organizational climate, characterized by high organizational identification and low competitive climate, to reduce spillovers of proprietary knowledge to outside entities.

To this end, I have engaged in an extensive field study of CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, together with my colleague Maria Rita Micheli, who is an assistant professor at IESEG School of Management in Paris. By engaging in inductive theory-development followed by a field experiment aimed at testing our theory, we show that employees are less likely to disclose proprietary knowledge when they feel an integral part of the organization, but more likely to disclose when the motivational climate is oriented towards performance, with the organization encouraging them to outperform coworkers. We now want to carry out an experiment that aims at provides a causal test of the mechanisms. 

First, we expect a performance-oriented motivational climate to positively affect the disclosure of knowledge across organizational boundaries. Our argument is that in presence of a performance-oriented motivational climate where the focus is on individual performance with high emphasis on peer comparison, group members will be more reluctant to share knowledge with their peers because they perceive that success is defined as the ability to outperform their colleagues and not simply as personal improvement/achievement. Hence, they will be relatively more willing to disclose proprietary knowledge to individuals that are outside of their group, which are not in direct comparison/competition. Second, we expect that a strong organizational identification to negatively affect the disclosure or knowledge across organizational boundaries. Our argument is that in presence of strong organizational identification, individuals’ alignment of interests (with the group/organizations’ ones) and substantial sense of belonging (category/group salience), will reduce the probability of proprietary knowledge outbound flows from the group/organization.

Although the clear and significant relationship between organizational identification and motivational climate as coexisting characteristics of groups/organizations, we are not primarily interested in any interaction between the two constructs. For this reason, we propose a research design in which the effects of performance-orientation and organizational identification are examined in two separate experiments. The objective is to study the following research questions independently:

-	How do different degrees of performance orientation in the motivational climate influence knowledge sharing dynamics within and across groups?
-	How do different degrees of organizational identification influence knowledge sharing dynamics within and across groups?
 
As it becomes apparent from the above-mentioned research questions, the two experiments share the same dependent variable and overall setting. Therefore, a general set-up can be used for both experiments simultaneously.",step2,True
How Does Mortgage Debt Affect Household Consumption? Micro Evidence from China,"AbstractThe high growth rate of mortgage debt in various emerging and developed economies has captured headlines following the financial crisis. In this article, we investigate how mortgage debt impacts household consumption behavior and various components of household consumption. Utilizing comprehensive household survey data from China, we show that households with a mortgage consume a higher portion of income than households without a mortgage. This is in line with the argument that having a mortgage reduces the uncertainty that the household faces regarding how much to save each month in order to be able to own a house, and this reduced uncertainty leads to lower monthly savings for the purpose of buying a house. We also find that among households with a mortgage, those who spend a larger share of their income on mortgage payments spend less on consumption, reflecting the crowding out effect of mortgage payments on household consumption. Furthermore, we show that a government policy of decreasing the maximum loan‐to‐value ratio has a significant impact on households’ consumption. The article offers the first evidence of the impact of growing mortgage debt on the consumption behavior of households, and will have implications for government policies that encourage mortgage borrowing.",step2,True
Challenges and shortcomings in current South African industrial wastewater quality characterisation,"Previous research in South Africa has identified gaps in wastewater quality characterisation and remediation. Wastewater quality indicators need to be known in order to reuse, recycle, and/or recover resources, but are poorly reported for wastewater streams. Formal and relational approaches were used to access wastewater quality information. Relational approaches included building relationships with industry partners through telephone calls, emails and meetings, while formal approaches included requests for public documents and legal applications using the Promotion of Access to Information Act. Published data were another source of information. The following industries were identified as major wastewater generating industries: pulp and paper, fish processing, power generation, mining and petroleum. Seven parameters were commonly used to indicate quality: pH, volume, electrical conductivity, nitrogen, sulphate, sodium and chemical oxygen demand. Calcium was not measured, even though discharge limits are required in environmental licenses. The accessed wastewater quality data ranged from qualitative to quantitative. The number of parameters used varied within and between industries. Although wastewater information is non-confidential, in practice it is not readily available. There are opportunities to improve wastewater management and resource recovery; however, this needs to happen in an environment of trust and transparency. This is currently lacking between industry, government, and research bodies.",step2,True
Services trade and labor market outcomes: Evidence from Italian firms,"AbstractThis paper empirically investigates the effects of services imports and exports on firm employment. We use microdata on Italian firms for the period 2009–2017. Applying a shift‐share instrumental variable approach, we show that services imports and exports have a positive impact on total employment. This finding holds for managers, white‐collar workers, and blue‐collar workers. We also show that services exports are particularly effective in increasing employment of “servitized” manufacturing firms as well as of companies that are deeply integrated into international services markets. Overall, this paper suggests that firm employment might largely benefit from the services trade dimension of globalization.",step2,True
Sensitivity about inventory leanness,"PurposeThis study aims to suggest that firms and stock market investors are more sensitive about inventory leanness when industry information technology (IT) usage is high. First, when industry IT usage is high, a firm's inventory leanness is more responsive to information inputs (cash holding and sales efficiency). Second, when industry IT usage is high, the price-to-earnings ratio (indicative of stock market investors' willingness to pay a premium) is more sensitive to the firm's inventory leanness.Design/methodology/approachThis study highlights the contextual role of industry IT usage during the 1998–2009 lost decade (wherein the steepest falls in manufacturing jobs happened in the USA).FindingsThe results highlight the significant contextual role of industry IT usage. In manufacturing industry sectors with high IT usage, (1) inventory levels of firms are more responsive to information inputs and (2) stock market investors have greater appreciation for inventory leanness.Originality/valueThe lost decade, 1998–2009, was a difficult period for the manufacturing industry. Nonetheless, there was variation in stock market valuations of manufacturing firms, with many firms outperforming others. Stock market investors were sensitive to inventory leanness.

Disability Among Native-born and Foreign-born Blacks in the United States,"Abstract
               Using the 5% Public Use Micro Data Sample (PUMS) from the 2000 U.S. census, we examine differences in disability among eight black subgroups distinguished by place of birth and Hispanic ethnicity. We found that all foreign-born subgroups reported lower levels of physical activity limitations and personal care limitations than native-born blacks. Immigrants from Africa reported lowest levels of disability, followed by non-Hispanic immigrants from the Caribbean. Sociodemographic characteristics and timing of immigration explained the differences between these two groups. The foreign-born health advantage was most evident among the least-educated except among immigrants from Europe/Canada, who also reported the highest levels of disability among the foreign-born. Hispanic identification was associated with poorer health among both native-born and foreign-born blacks.",step2,True
Occupational Attainment And The Earnings Of Native-Born And Foreign-Born Canadians,"The economic performance of immigrants has been studied primarily in terms of entry earnings and how these earnings evolve over time in the host country. The empirical analysis typically revolves around variants of an earnings function, which relates worker earnings to human capital and other individual characteristics. In this literature, the effects of occupational attainment on earnings are typically not modelled mainly because occupation is perceived as just another way of looking at earnings. However, as noted by Chiswick and Miller (2008), amongst others, occupation is the channel through which an individuals human capital translates into earnings. That is, education has both a direct impact on earnings and an indirect one operating through occupational status. Empirical findings for the US and Australia provide support for this view. Our objective in this paper is to extend this analysis to Canada, to assess how the earnings gains from human capital depend upon occupational status for both native-born and immigrant workers, and upon the length of residence of the latter in Canada. This will also shed light on the relative importance of the intra-occupational vis-a-vis inter-occupational mobility of immigrants in realizing earnings gains from education, in the short and longer term. The paper assesses these issues by looking at data drawn from the 2001 Canadian census.",step2,True
Financial Distress Research Project,"PIs: Jim Greiner, Lois Lupica, and Dalié Jiménez.

In the United States, low- and moderate-income (“LMI”) individuals experience personal financial crisis through the lens of law. Small claims court debt collection, bankruptcy court, and contract negotiations with creditors dominate the experience.  But LMI individuals are priced out of the private attorney market, and resource constraints prevent free legal services providers from offering traditional legal assistance to LMI individuals in financial distress. The result is a challenge: propose and test ways to provide low-cost self-help assistance to LMI individuals in financial distress. This study assesses legal and financial outcomes of LMI individuals when randomly assigned to two treatment contrasts. The first treatment contrast is a set of innovative, behaviorally informed, cartoon-based self-help packets covering the legal aspects of financial crisis versus a traditional attorney-client relationship with a legal aid attorney covering the same scope. The second contrast is “live” financial counseling (Internet or telephone call, as required by Congress to obtain a bankruptcy discharge) versus financial counseling delivered via a paper packet. Outcome variables include litigation results from court files; credit scores and over 200 credit attributes from a credit reporting agency; and survey responses focusing on financial knowledge and stress levels. Each of the four cells in the saturated design will have 300 subjects. Available cost information will facilitate efficiency comparisons.

"Assessing concerns for the economic consequence of the COVID-19 response and mental health problems associated with economic vulnerability and negative economic shock in Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom","Currently, many different countries are under lockdown or extreme social distancing measures to control the spread of COVID-19. The potentially far-reaching side effects of these measures have not yet been fully understood. In this study we analyse the results of a multi-country survey conducted in Italy (N=3,504), Spain (N=3,524) and the United Kingdom (N=3,523), with two separate analyses. In the first analysis, we examine the elicitation of citizens’ concerns over the downplaying of the economic consequences of the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. We control for Social Desirability Bias through a list experiment included in the survey. In the second analysis, we examine the data from the same survey to estimate the consequences of the economic lockdown in terms of mental health, by predicting the level of stress, anxiety and depression associated with being economically vulnerable and having been affected by a negative economic shock. To accomplish this, we have used a prediction algorithm based on machine learning techniques. To quantify the size of this affected population, we compare its magnitude with the number of people affected by COVID-19 using measures of susceptibility, vulnerability and behavioural change collected in the same questionnaire. We find that the concern for the economy and for “the way out” of the lockdown is diffuse and there is evidence of minor underreporting. Additionally, we estimate that around 42.8% of the populations in the three countries are at high risk of stress, anxiety and depression, based on their level of economic vulnerability and their exposure to a negative economic shock. Therefore, it can be concluded that the lockdown and extreme social distancing in the three countries has had an enormous impact on individuals’ mental health and this should be taken into account for future decisions made on regulations concerning the pandemic.",step2,True

Understanding the Impacts of Federal and State Immigration Enforcement Policies on Latinx Children’s Educational Outcomes in the United States.,"What effects do restrictive immigration enforcement policies have on Latinx
academic achievement?

Introduction. Amuedo-Dorantes and Lopez (2017) found that the presence of increased immigration enforcement policy lead to increases in student dropout rates and grade repetition. Bellows (2018) found that the presence of Secure Communities programs throughout the US between 2008-2013 decreased the overall English Language Arts (ELA) scores for Latinx and non-Hispanic black children. Bellows achieved this through using a fixed-effects model with the SEDA panel data from 2008-2009 to 2012-2013 school years. Her study was the first to analyze the impacts of immigration enforcement policies on Latinx children’s educational achievement. This project seeks to extend the works of Amuedo-Dorantes and Lopez and Bellows by examining the presence of state and federal immigration enforcement policies on Latinx student achievement through the use of SEDA panel data from 2008-2009 to 2014-2015 and difference- in-difference methodology. Through the use of DD methodology over a longer period of time this study will help to understand both immediate and short term impacts of the Secure Communities program coupled with state omnibus laws. However, it should be noted that the Secure Communities program was repealed in 2014 so the impacts may vary when the treatment effect is effectively turned off.

Data. In order to gauge the impacts of the Secure Communities program and state omnibus laws on Latinx children’s educational achievement outcomes county-year panel data will be compiled from a variety of sources between 2008-2015. The primary data set used in this study will be obtained from the Stanford Education Data Archives (SEDA) (Reardon et al., 2017). SEDA data are constructed using data from a variety of sources, the primary source being EdFacts system at the U.S. Department of Education (USEd), which has aggregate test scores for each of the 50 state’s standardized testing programs (Fahle et al., 2018). The data obtained from
EdFacts are from 2008-2009 to 2014-2015 school years in English Language Arts and Math achievement for 3rd to 8th grade (Fahle et al., 2018). SEDA 2.1 also provides the socio- demographic characteristics of school districts, which come from the 2006-2010 Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates (EDGE) and the Common Core of Data (CCD) (Fahle et al., 2018).
In addition to the SEDA data information regarding the Secure Communities programs roll outs and state omnibus laws will be collected from a variety of sources. Information on the Secure Communities program, dates of county implementation and roll out will be obtained from the ICE archive website. Following methods used by Amuedo-Dorantes and Lopez (2017), I will use the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCLS) website to gather state omnibus laws information such as geographic location and date enacted (month/date) between 2006-2013.
Research Design. Due to the availability of education data and changes in presidential administrations and priorities in immigration enforcement efforts, I will limit the study window from 2008-2015. This study window allows me to establish baseline trends among my sample population and trends after local and federal policy implementation in order to see their short- term and some long-term effects. Stata/ SE version 16.0 will be used to preform difference-in- difference (DD) methodology to understand the impacts that the presence of state omnibus laws and the Secure Communities program have on Latinx youth in 3rd-8th grade ELA and math scores.

HHUUD10: Historical Housing Unit and Urbanization Database 2010,"Subcounty housing unit counts are important for studying geo-historical patterns of (sub)urbanization, land-use change, and residential loss and gain.

Overcoming these barriers, we provide housing unit estimates in consistent 2010 tract boundaries for every census year from 1940 to 2010 plus 2019 for the entire continental US. Moreover, we develop an “urbanization year” indicator that denotes if and when tracts became “urbanized” during this timeframe. We produce these data by blending existing interpolation techniques with a novel procedure we call “maximum reabsorption”. Conducting out-of-sample validation, we find that our hybrid approach generally produces more reliable estimates than existing alternatives.

Neighborhood racial demographics predict infants’ neural responses to people of different races,"Early in life, greater exposure to diverse people can change the tendency to prefer one’s own social group. For instance, infants from racially diverse environments show less preference for their own-race (ingroup) over other-race (outgroup) faces than infants from racially homogeneous environments. Yet how social environment changes ingroup versus outgroup demarcation in infancy is unclear. A commonly held assumption is that early emerging ingroup preference is based on an affective process: feeling more comfortable with familiar ingroup than unfamiliar outgroup members. However, other processes may also underlie ingroup preference: Infants may attend more to ingroup than outgroup members and/or mirror the actions of ingroup over outgroup individuals. By aggregating 7- to 12-month-old infants’ electroencephalography (EEG) activity across three studies, we disambiguate these different processes in the EEG oscillations of preverbal infants according to social environment. White infants from more racially diverse neighborhoods exhibited greater frontal theta oscillation (an index of top-down attention) and more mu rhythm desynchronization (an index of motor system activation and potentially neural mirroring) to racial outgroup individuals than White infants from less racially diverse neighborhoods. Neighborhood racial demographics did not relate to White infants’ frontal alpha asymmetry (a measure of approach-withdrawal motivation) toward racial outgroup individuals. Racial minority infants showed no effects of neighborhood racial demographics in their neural responses to racial outgroup individuals. These results indicate that neural mechanisms that may underlie social bias and prejudices are related to neighborhood racial demographics in the first year of life.",step2,True

Using a spatial multilevel model and the 2016 National Survey of Children’s Health, we estimated childhood overweight and obesity prevalence rates at the Census regional division, state, and county levels using small-area estimation with poststratification. A sample of 24,162 children aged 10–17 years was used to estimate a national overweight and obesity rate of 30.7% (95% confidence interval: 27.0%, 34.9%). There was substantial county-to-county variability (range, 7.0% to 80.9%), with 31 out of 3,143 counties having an overweight and obesity rate significantly different from the national rate. Estimates from counties located in the Pacific region had higher uncertainty than other regions, driven by a higher proportion of underrepresented sociodemographic groups. Child-level overweight and obesity was related to race/ethnicity, sex, parental highest education (P &amp;lt; 0.01 for all), county-level walkability (P = 0.03), and urban/rural designation (P = 0.02). Overweight and obesity remains a vital issue for US youth, with substantial area-level variability.

Bank competition and economic growth,"
Purpose
The degree and impact of competitiveness in the banking sector is of great importance as this has great impact on the financial system and the wider economy. A question of interest here is, does competition in the commercial banking sector boost or hamper economic growth. The purpose of this paper is to test the hypothesis that competitiveness in commercial banking is linked to economic growth.


Design/methodology/approach
The authors use the Boone (2008) indicator to estimate competitiveness of banking markets in ten frontier countries in Africa from 2005 to 2012. This model measures banking competitiveness by assessing the relationship between relative marginal costs and relative market share. Through a panel data model, the authors examine the effect banking sector competitiveness has on economic growth.


Findings
The results of Boone (2008) indicator suggest that, to a greater extent, banks in the countries studied have a competitive banking sector. The results of the panel data estimation support the hypothesis that banking sector competition impacts positively on economic growth.


Practical implications
The paper recommends for more policy geared towards enhancing bank competition. This is because competitive banking system will allocate resources more efficiently to improve economic growth.


Originality/value
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to test the link between bank competition and economic growth in a cross-section of Frontier African countries.

"Population Growth, Immigration, and Labor Market Dynamics","Abstract
               This article provides a first synthesis of population flows and labor market dynamics across immigrant and native-born populations. We devise a novel dynamic accounting methodology that integrates population flows from two sources—changes in birth cohort size and immigrant flows—with labor market dynamics. We illustrate the method using data for the United Kingdom, where population flows have been large and cyclical, driven first by the maturation of baby boom cohorts in the 1980s and later by immigration in the 2000s. New measures of labor market flows by migrant status uncover the flow origins of disparities in the levels and cyclicality of immigrant and native labor market outcomes and their more recent convergence. An application of our accounting framework reveals that population flows have played a nontrivial role in the volatility of labor markets among the UK-born and, especially, immigrants.",step2,True
Four decades of Canadian earnings inequality and dynamics across workers and firms,"This paper studies the evolution of individual earnings inequality and dynamics in Canada from 1983 to 2016 using tax files and administrative records. Linking individual tax filers to their employers (and rich administrative records on firms) beginning in 2001, it also documents the relationship between the earnings dynamics of workers and the size and growth of their employers. It highlights three main patterns over this period: First, with a few exceptions (sharp increase in top 1% and declining gender gap), Canada has experienced relatively modest changes in overall earnings inequality, volatility, and mobility between 1983 and 2016. Second, earnings inequality and the distribution of earnings growth vary substantially over the business cycle. Third, the earnings dynamics of individuals are strongly related to the size and employment growth of their employers.",step2,True

"Central air conditioning, air pollution and housing location: evidence from Lebanon","
Purpose
This study aims to examine the impact of local air pollution on the presence of central air conditioners in apartments in Lebanon.


Design/methodology/approach
This study applies a Probit model in a unique data set on apartments’ listings for sale in Lebanon collected by Marrouch and Sayour (2021). The data set includes information about air pollution concentrations, dwellings’ characteristics, geographic features and location characteristics.


Findings
This study finds that local air pollution positively and significantly affects the presence of central air conditioning in dwellings. The estimated increase in the probability of having central air conditioning for a one microgram per cubic meter increase in Particulate Matter 2.5 concentration is 6.4%.


Research limitations/implications
The data set in this study is cross-sectional and thus does not capture variations over time for the examined variables.


Practical implications
The Probit regression approximates an equation that can predict the presence of central air conditioners in dwellings, which might be useful to policymakers.


Social implications
The findings suggest that local pollution is a significant factor in household behavior in Lebanon.


Originality/value
This paper adds to the scant literature studying the effects of air pollution on the presence of central air conditioning in developing countries. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first paper to study the impact of air pollution on the presence of central air conditioning in the Middle East and North Africa Region.

But rather than engaging in debates over the democratic potential of digital technologies, it’s arguably more productive to look at the range of ways that this emerging ‘digital civics’ is reconfiguring how we conceptualize and practice citizenship in the era of big data. The chapter first turns to discussing how citizenship is increasingly defined in relation to data and data practices, and how these redefinitions have precipitated larger changes in the way citizenship is conceptualized and operationalized. Second, the chapter identifies three ongoing, interrelated changes to the digital civics landscape that are worthy of greater attention moving forward. These include the spatialization of digital civics, the corporatization of digital civics, and the growing prominence of oppositional uses of digital civics that seek to challenge the social and political status quo.",step2,True
Growth survey of academic researchers,"Open Registration

Here, we provide an open registration that includes some pre-registered hypotheses. 
The overall research interest underlying this project is the following. We want to survey academic researchers about the possibility of “green growth”, by which we mean continued economic growth while meeting sustainability targets (i.e., the non-breaking of crucial planetary boundaries). To do so, we will invite approximately 50’000 researchers. The sample has been created in the following way: We have identified all researchers on SCOPUS, who have published an article in a TOP 100 journal of the field environmental science (SCOPUS: “Environmental Sciences”) or economics (SCOPUS: “Economics, Econometrics, and Finance) in the past five years. “TOP JOURNAL” refers to the SCOPUS CITE SCORE for the year 2021. 
Pre-analysis: Tests of representativeness of survey respondents versus all invitees.
For the 50,000 prospective participants, we obtained their h-factor, number of documents, cited by, co-author count, first and last publication, and gender (obtained via the gender-API algorithm). We will test differences between respondents and invited participants, to see if our sample is representative for the population. 

Data exclusion rules: We will always use the maximum data available. No data exclusions are planned and if survey respondents drop out before finishing the survey, we will fill the missing answers as missing data points, but keep the individual in the final sample. 

Main analyses

A primary interest of the study is to descriptively show the results. Descriptive results are generally not pre-registered and no hypotheses are formed. However, there are some confirmatory statistical tests that we will run, in an effort to test pre-registered hypotheses.
One set of hypotheses addresses the potentially different answering pattern between economists and other researchers, broadly construed. We will label as “economists” those researchers who self-identify as belonging to the SCOPUS disciplines “Business, Management and Accounting” or “Economics, Econometrics and Finance”. We will label as “non-economists” those researchers self-identify as belonging to other disciplines according to the SCOPUS classification. 

Hypothesis 1:
The share of economists expecting that Green Growth is possible is higher than the share of other researchers. We test the differences in the answer to the question “All things considered, would you say that Green Growth is possible on a global level?” (Yes versus No).

Exploratory question 1: We explore differences in the subjective certainty of their answer to the question above. 

Hypothesis 2:
Hypothesis 2 will require qualitative methods. In open questions, we will ask survey respondents to explain their answer to the question above. The question are:
“Please provide the main reasoning for your answer in your own words. Please write as much as you want: You may answer using bullet points.”
And
“What do you consider the strongest arguments for the possibility of Green Growth? List up to three arguments. Please try to use as few words as possible for each argument.”
And
“What do you consider the strongest arguments against the possibility of Green Growth? List up to three arguments. Please try to use as few words as possible for each argument.”


In general, we hypothesize that economists (compared to non-economists) will refer to a stronger degree to the decoupling of emissions and economic output compared to other scientific fields. On the flipside, we hypothesize that non-economists will to a stronger degree refer to the (lack of) absolute decoupling of emissions and GDP, as well as on the material footprints associated with GDP growth. Wherever possible, analysts’ degree of freedom are explicitly stated and presented in the supplementary material, to provide convergent evidence for any result from multiple models (i.e., multi-verse analysis).

Another set of hypotheses addresses differences in ideal growth rates, caused by intrinsic factors (i.e., being an economist versus not) or by extrinsic factors

Hypothesis 3: Economists will suggest higher ideal growth compared to non-economists, in both high and low income countries. This pattern will be present in both experimental conditions. We do not analyze interactions.

Hypothesis 4: When asked about growth rates versus growth factors (experimental manipulation), people will suggest higher ideal growth when asked about growth rates compared to growth factors. We do not pre-register interactions (e.g., different answering patterns between economists and non-economists).

Hypothesis 5: Across all participants, the perceived ideal growth rate is higher for low income countries than high income countries (in both experimental conditions).

Another set of hypotheses will address differences in answering patterns with regards to planetary boundaries. 

Hypothesis 6: Non-economist scholars list more planetary boundaries than economists when asked about the major environmental issues that are currently of interest. 

Hypothesis 7: Economists, more than non-economists, assume that growth is necessary to mitigate environmental problems.

Another final hypothesis will address differences in regional exposure to environmental issues and acceptance of climate policy.

Hypothesis 8: Scientists' perceptions of the magnitude of anticipated climate change and biodiversity loss in their own region influences the perceived need for regulatory action.",step2,True
"DEDOLLARIZATION OFTHEWORLD ECONOMY: CAUSES, MANIFESTATIONS, CONSEQUENCES","The article is devoted to the study of the causes, factors, manifestations and consequences of dedollarization of the world economy. The main events that had the greatest impact on the US dollar receiving the status of a world reserve currency are identified and analyzed.
The structure of official foreign exchange reserves is analyzed. It is noted that the leading world reserve currency is the US dollar, but over the past two decades the share of world reserves in US dollars has decreased. It has been determined that the global policy of dedollarization of the world economy in recent years has been intensified by many countries to an even greater extent than in previous crisis periods. This is manifested, first of all, in the fact that national economies, trying to protect their financial systems from the “uncontrollable” flow of dollars, are switching to settlements in national currencies.
The main reasons for the revival of the process of de-dollarization of the world economy in 2023 are identified: deepening regional financial integration, the establishment of cooperation between countries based on common geopolitical interests, fears of financial sanctions from the United States, the growth of the budget deficit and US public debt, unstable US monetary policy, etc.
The main manifestations of the process of de-dollarization in the global economic system are highlighted: the transition to settlements in national currencies in bilateral trade; projects to create common currencies; diversification of gold and foreign exchange reserves of countries around the world; fragmentation of the geopolitical world as a prerequisite for the creation of currency blocs (using the example of BRICS). The problematic aspects of replacing the US dollar as an international reserve currency in the short and medium term are substantiated.
It is concluded that the decline in the importance of the dollar as the main reserve currency has been steadily observed over the past several decades, but at the present stage of development, no currency has the potential to replace it in this capacity.",step2,True
The Economics of Capital Allocation in Firms: Evidence from Internal Capital Markets," We analyze a unique chief financial officer (CFO) survey data set to examine capital allocation in firms. Top management is aware of agency and information problems at the divisional level and organizes the budgeting process to counteract managerial opportunism, employing systems of interconnected measures, including layers of approval, divisional budgets, reporting requirements, and compensation schemes. When making funding decisions, top management relies heavily on top-level nonfinancial information, such as the assessment of divisional managers’ abilities. However, substantial parts of the capital budget do not require top management approval as firms trade off the benefits and costs of decentralization, thereby deviating from the traditional paradigm of decentralized project initiation but centralized project approval. Even firms with active internal capital markets tilt capital allocation toward relatively even distributions, reflecting the use of capital allocation as a credible communication device. We also find that within-firm agency problems may result in capital rationing, that is, divisions’ restricted access to internal capital. CFOs also believe that integrating multiple businesses into an internal capital market results in tangible financial benefits, predominantly lower costs of capital and higher debt capacities. Thus, our findings also support coinsurance arguments suggesting that internal capital markets may improve access to external financing.  This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.

House Prices &amp; Property Tax Revenues During the Boom &amp; Bust: Evidence from Small-Area Estimates,"Although the Great Recession put the U.S. economy into a tailspin, we know little about how the changes in house prices influenced property tax collections. Using local level housing data from Zillow matched to property tax data from 1998 to 2012, two questions are examined. First, the elasticity of property tax revenue with respect to house values is estimated. Second, the timing of this elasticity is determined. The analysis rules out that local policymakers capture the entire increase of house value in property tax revenues but unable to rule out that increases in house values are completely offset by changes in effective property tax rates. Decreases in values have an elasticity between 0.3 and 0.4 and take three years for changes in values to impact property tax revenues. While property tax collections declined, local policymakers adjusted effective millage rates such that revenues did not decline as much as home values.",step2,True
"Neighborhood Change, One Pint at a Time: The Impact of Local Characteristics on Craft Breweries","Cities have recognized the local impact of small craft breweries, altering municipal codes to make it easier to establish breweries as anchor points of economic development and revitalization. However, we do not know the extent to which these strategies impact change at the neighborhood scale across the U.S. In this chapter, we examine the relationship between the growth and locations of craft breweries and the incidence of neighborhood change. We rely on a unique data set of geocoded brewery locations that tracks openings and closings from 2004 to the present. Using measures of neighborhood change often found in the gentrification literature, we develop statistical models of census tract demographic and employment data to determine the extent to which brewery locations are associated with social and demographic shifts since 2000. The strongest predictor of whether a craft brewery opened in 2013 or later in a neighborhood was the presence of a prior brewery. We do not find evidence entirely consistent with the common narrative of a link between gentrification and craft brewing, but we do find a link between an influx of lower-to-middle income urban creatives and the introduction of a craft brewery. We advocate for urban planners to recognize the importance of craft breweries in neighborhood revitalization while also protecting residents from potential displacement.",step2,True
Audit Firm Tenure and Fraudulent Financial Reporting,"The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) required the U.S. Comptroller General to study the potential effects of requiring mandatory audit firm rotation. The General Accounting Office (GAO) concludes in its recently released study of mandatory audit firm rotation that “mandatory audit firm rotation may not be the most efficient way to strengthen auditor independence” (GAO 2003, Highlights). However, the GAO also suggests that mandatory audit firm rotation could be necessary if the Sarbanes-Oxley Act's requirements do not lead to improved audit quality (GAO 2003, 5).
               We examine the relation between audit firm tenure and fraudulent financial reporting. Comparing firms cited for fraudulent reporting from 1990 through 2001 with both a matched set of non-fraud firms and with the available population of non-fraud firms, we find that fraudulent financial reporting is more likely to occur in the first three years of the auditor-client relationship. We fail to find any evidence that fraudulent financial reporting is more likely given long auditor tenure. Our results are consistent with the argument that mandatory audit firm rotation could have adverse effects on audit quality.",step2,True
Homelessness Prevention through Eviction Diversion: an RCT,"Evictions, both informal and court-ordered, are one of the most common pathways to homelessness, but proven interventions to interrupt this pathway are few.  Two of three rigorous studies completed in this area show that providing a lawyer to a defendant in formal court eviction proceedings results in fewer court ordered evictions.  But there are no corresponding studies regarding whether legal advice provided before the landlord files a formal eviction will result in favorable resolutions for tenants, including improved housing conditions and fewer formal and informal evictions.  Is early, low-cost legal assistance an effective, and cost-effective, intervention to prevent evictions that may lead to homelessness?  This study hypothesizes that such is the case and will provide rigorous evidence in partnership with Legal Services of Greater Miami.  With an anticipated study size of 616 people and a treatment including brief legal advice for individuals threatened with informal eviction by landlords refusing to make repairs, we will learn whether so-called “eviction diversion” is a useful tool to divert individuals and families away from a court eviction, to combat homelessness, and to keep people housed longer.

Results show that changes in production prices and wages at country*industry levels are informative about the creation of rents impeding productivity in different ways and to different extents. A simulation based on OECD regulation indicators suggests that nearly all countries could expect sizeable gains in multifactor productivity from the implementation of large structural reform programs changing anticompetitive regulation practices on product and labor markets.

#MeToo and Sexual Violence Reporting in the National Crime Victimization Survey," The Me Too Movement has reshaped cultural awareness about sexual violence but little is known about how this shift may have coincided with changes in the reporting of sexual violence. The current study is the first to use the National Crime Victimization Survey to compare pre-#MeToo and post-#MeToo reports of sexual violence across three different blocks of time (Time 1: 2014–2015; Time 2: October 2017–September 2019; Time 3: October 2019–September 2021). Comparisons include prevalence rates of overall sexual violence, self-reports of sexual violence, official police reports of sexual violence, and situational characteristics of sexual violence (offender was a stranger, victim injury, victim services used). We also examine gender (women/men) and racial (White women/non-White women) differences in sexual violence reporting. Using formal comparisons, we find a significant increase in the rates of overall sexual violence as well as self-reports and stranger-offender reports of sexual violence between the pre- (Time 1) and the first post-#MeToo time point (Time 2). However, these increases are no longer evident in Time 3. In addition, the changes between the pre- (Time 1) and the first post-#MeToo time point (Time 2) are driven primarily by White women’s reporting of sexual violence, and we find no significant changes in the rates of sexual violence experienced by men nor non-White women during these time periods.

Estimating Local Daytime Population Density from Census and Payroll Data,"Daytime population density reflects where people commute and spend their waking hours. It carries significant weight as urban planners and engineers site transportation infrastructure and utilities, plan for disaster recovery, and assess urban vitality.

This study estimates the San Francisco Bay Area's tract-level daytime population density from US Census and LEHD LODES data. Estimated daytime densities are substantially more concentrated than corresponding nighttime population densities, reflecting regional land use patterns.

Political Elites and Inequality – Political Elites Module,"This module is a second component of a broader project on political elites and inequality (approved by the University of Konstanz’s IRB, Number 10/2021). The first component of the project involves a public opinion survey of German citizens to understand their attitudes on inequality and redistributive policies. 

This second component, which is a study of political elites, consists of a survey part and a structured interview part. The survey part contains multiple experimental designs as well as standard survey questions on political preferences. Among the topics covered in the survey are ones on baby bonds, inheritance tax, tuition fees, and public pension.

The interview part features open-ended questions aimed at understanding the elites’ attitudes in a more in-depth way. We will transcribe all interviews to help identify more contextual variables, such as the elites’ political rationales, strategies, and preferences. This contextual information will be combined with information from the survey part to explore and answer different research questions.",step2,True
Strengthening School Readiness through Pre-K for All: A University-District Partnership,"This project was developed in the context of a partnership between researchers at New York University (NYU) and early education leaders in the Division of Early Childhood Education (DECE) at the Department of Education (DOE) in New York City (NYC). This collaboration was formed initially to “take the pulse” of NYC’s historic expansion of free, full-day high quality pre-K to every NYC four-year-old under Pre-K for All. In this study, we evaluate DECE’s large and complex system of professional learning (PL) for pre-K professionals, designed to support high-quality pre-K programming. Specifically, we evaluate the impact of two PL approaches, or “series,” that were part of DECE’s PL system, each with a clear and differentiated content-specific focus and theory of change (i.e., Explore, a math focus; Create, an arts focus), relative to a third general, content-agnostic PL series (Teaching Team Learning Communities (TTLC)). Our research design allows us to answer the following research questions: 

1. What are the impacts of Create PL compared to TTLC:
a. On children’s school readiness at the end of pre-K?
b. On program quality?

2. What are the impacts of Explore PL compared to TTLC:
a. On children’s school readiness at the end of pre-K?
b. On program quality?

3. What are the pooled impacts of content-specific PL (Create and Explore sites combined) compared to content-agnostic PL (TTLC control sites combined):
a. On children’s school readiness at the end of pre-K?
b. On program quality?

4. To what extent do impacts of the NYC pre-K for All PL system vary across subgroups of NYC pre-K children (e.g., varying baseline risk, racial/ethnic groups)?

To answer these questions, we leverage DECE’s randomization of pre-K sites to PL series (Create or TTLC, Explore or TTLC) and multiple data sources, including child-level administrative data from DECE (e.g., baseline and demographic data), direct assessments of children’s skills in the spring of pre-K (e.g., math skills, language skills, executive functioning), and site- and classroom-level administrative data from DECE (e.g., classroom observation data). 

For our first two research questions investigating the impacts of Create and Explore separately, we are underpowered in our tests of school readiness and therefore plan to examine trends and effect sizes. Given that we are underpowered for these Create- and Explore-specific impact analyses on children’s school readiness, we also plan to investigate the effects of content-specific PL using our pooled sample of sites in both content-specific series (Create and Explore) relative to sites in the content-agnostic series (TTLC) in our third research question. We are adequately powered to conduct all impact analyses on program quality (Explore separately, Create separately, and the pooled sample).",step2,True

Does it go to child-centric goods like food or does it go to adult work related expenses? The paper uses two difference-in-difference designs.

"Motivation, Opportunity and Ability;  as constraints for Women to Search for Paid Work","In the Netherlands, 350,699 women have no personal income (from paid job or social benefits, throughout 2019, Kröner et al. (under review)) and are financially dependent on other streams of income, such as their partners.  In the same year, 76,346 men between 15-64 were without income and social benefits, which means that 82.12% of the persons without income and social benefits were women. Their economic dependency, frequently on their partner, can make them vulnerable to economic instability in case of separation, or death or disablement of the primary breadwinner. In addition, financial dependence can foster domestic violence. One of the main protective behaviours for this economic vulnerability is for women to have a personal source of income: e.g. work. Furthermore, women without a paid job and social benefits, may be employable, and given the current labour shortages, societies are likely interested in utilizing all potential workforce. 

In this research, we aim to shed light on factors that might hinder women in this position to (try) to get a job. We expect the reasons and factors to be divers and as such use the MOA framework (Rothschild, 1999) by focusing on the motivation, abilities, and opportunities of these women to search for work. 

We would, therefore, conduct a constraining model analysis (Siemsen et al., 2008) to study and better understand the MOA factors that constrain women in this particular population to work. In addition, we will study if within this population the barriers are different between 3 groups based on demographic variables such as number of children, age, migration status. 

In line with the MOA framework (Rothschild, 1999), we argue that constrains on any of the MOA factors can be a barrier for women to work. Indeed, if women have the ability, but lack the opportunity and motivation to work, they will mostly be unable to work. Similarly, if women are motivated to work, but lack the ability and/or opportunity to work, they will mostly be unable to work, etc. Importantly, for the purpose of future interventions it is important to understand which of the factors is the most prominent obstacle for women

Note, motivation, ability and opportunity are multi-faceted concepts: Motivation is influenced by personal attitudes towards the importance, ambition, willingness to work. Their life satisfaction and identification with their current (unpaid) work situation and the financial necessity for women to work. But, also by the social norms towards work (whether family or friends expect them and to work or not). Opportunity a broad construct that encompasses the social support women might have to get a job and to help with (unpaid) responsibilities if they have a paid work (e.g. childcare), as well as, the presence of suitable job opportunities. Similarly, Ability is influenced by the education and work experience of individuals, as well their mental and physical health, and the skills and self-esteem needed to find and have work. Therefore, we first study Motivation, Opportunity, Ability separately (factor analysis) to understand and test the relevant predictors.",step2,True

Assimilation and Coverage of the Foreign-Born Population in Administrative Records,"The U.S. Census Bureau is researching ways to incorporate administrative data in decennial census and survey operations. Critical to this work is an understanding of the coverage of the population by administrative records. Using federal and third party administrative data linked to the American Community Survey (ACS), we evaluate the extent to which administrative records provide data on foreign-born individuals in the ACS and employ multinomial logistic regression techniques to evaluate characteristics of those who are in administrative records relative to those who are not. We find that overall, administrative records provide high coverage of foreign-born individuals in our sample for whom a match can be determined. The odds of being in administrative records are found to be tied to the processes of immigrant assimilation – naturalization, higher English proficiency, educational attainment, and full-time employment are associated with greater odds of being in administrative records. These findings suggest that as immigrants adapt and integrate into U.S. society, they are more likely to be involved in government and commercial processes and programs for which we are including data. We further explore administrative records coverage for the two largest race/ethnic groups in our sample – Hispanic and non-Hispanic single-race Asian foreign born, finding again that characteristics related to assimilation are associated with administrative records coverage for both groups. However, we observe that neighborhood context impacts Hispanics and Asians differently.",step2,True
Strategic Scientific Disclosure: Evidence from the Leahy–Smith America Invents Act,"ABSTRACTWe examine the impact of technological competition on voluntary innovation disclosure around the enactment of the Leahy–Smith America Invents Act of 2011 (“AIA”). The AIA moves the US patent system from the first‐to‐invent to first‐inventor‐to‐file system and induces a patent race that increases technological competition. Firms that are slow to file a patent are disadvantaged in this race. We find that focal firms with lagging patent classes strategically increase scientific publications in their lagging technology areas in an attempt to block competitors from obtaining a patent. This effect is more pronounced in technology areas where the firm has better information about their relative competitive position (proxied by greater inventor mobility), in technology classes with constraints on increasing patent filing timeliness (proxied by fewer experienced attorneys), and areas characterized by more intense competition. We find that the peers of firms with lagging classes experience greater patent filing rejections for lack of novelty and obviousness reasons after the AIA, suggesting that strategic scientific disclosure is effective.",step2,True
Understanding trends in functional limitations among older Americans.," OBJECTIVES: This report documents trends in functional limitations among older Americans from 1984 to 1993 and investigates reasons for such trends. METHODS: We applied logistic regression to data for noninstitutionalized Americans aged 50 years and older from the Survey of Income and Program Participation. We focused on 4 functional limitation measures unlikely to be affected by changes in role expectations and living environments: reported difficulty seeing words in a newspaper, lifting and carrying 10 pounds, climbing a flight of stairs, and walking a quarter of a mile. RESULTS: We found large declines in the crude prevalence of functional limitations, especially for those 80 years and older. Generally, changes in population composition explained only a small portion of the downward trends. Once changes in population composition and mobility-related device use were considered for difficulty walking, significant improvements in functioning remained for the 65- to 79-year-old group. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in population composition, device use, survey design, role expectations, and living environments do not appear to account completely for improvements in functioning. We infer that changes in under-lying physiological capability--whether real or perceived--likely underlie such trends. ",step2,True
"Understanding Mental Health, Vulnerabilities, and Coping in Older Koreans and Older Korean Americans","Abstract
               Although significant progress has been made in understanding mental health issues, racial/ethnic minorities are disadvantaged in terms of knowledge, attitude/stigma toward mental illness, and access to treatment. Older Koreans and Korean Americans are high-risk groups with great prevalence of stigma and limited access to mental services. The two groups share similarities as well as differences. For example, Older Korean Americans, a first-generation immigrant group, tend to share traditional values and beliefs with older Koreans. However, differences in social and cultural contexts, availability of social networks and resources, and access to health care systems present unique challenges and strategies. The purpose of this symposium is to enhance the understanding of critical issues in mental health among older Koreans and Korean Americans and identify challenges and strategies to promote mental health and well-being. Five studies conducted in Korea and the US will explore a variety of personal, social, and cultural factors related with mental health, based on quantitative and qualitative approaches. The diverse topics cover the mediating role of self-esteem in the relationship of stigma to emotional well-being, the effect of stress and coping on well-being, loneliness and negative family interactions, the relationship of life stressors and social capital on mental distress among older Korean Americans compared with other older Asian Americans, and community leaders’ attitude toward depression. The issues of vulnerabilities and resources will be discussed from the cultural perspectives as well as implications for future research and practice.",step2,True

The Citizenship Advantage: Immigrant Socioeconomic Attainment across Generations in the First Half of the Twentieth Century,"Scholars who study immigrant economic progress often point to the success of Southern and Eastern Europeans who entered in the early 20th century and draw inferences about whether today’s immigrants will follow a similar trajectory. However, little is known about the mechanisms that allowed for European upward advancement. This article begins to fill this gap by analyzing how naturalization policies influenced economic success of immigrants across generations. Specifically, I create new panel datasets that follow immigrants and their children across complete-count US censuses to understand the economic consequences of citizenship attainment. I find that naturalization raised occupational attainment for the first generation that then allowed children to have greater educational attainment and labor market success. I argue that economic progress was conditioned by political statuses for European-origin groups during the first half of the twentieth century.",step2,True

Mental Well-being Theory,"Rachmad, Yoesoep Edhie. 2022. Mental Well-being Theory. La Coruña Torre Publicaciones Internacionales, Edición Especial 2022.  https://doi.org/10.17605/osf.io/z8ekx


Mental Well-being Theory, introduced by Yoesoep Edhie Rachmad in 2022, emerged from the need to understand and enhance individual mental well-being in various contexts. In an era marked by rapid change and constant pressure, maintaining mental health has become increasingly important. This theory was developed to provide guidance on how individuals can achieve and maintain optimal mental well-being through a holistic and integrated approach.
Definition and Basic Concepts
Mental Well-being Theory defines mental well-being as a state in which individuals feel emotionally comfortable, have balance in their lives, and can effectively cope with challenges. The basic concept of this theory is that mental well-being involves not only the absence of mental disorders but also includes positive feelings, life fulfillment, and the ability to contribute productively to society. The theory emphasizes the importance of emotional, social, and environmental factors in shaping mental well-being.
Underlying Phenomena
The theory is based on the phenomenon that many individuals frequently experience emotional and mental pressures that can disrupt their well-being. For example, work stress, interpersonal conflicts, and life uncertainties can lead to mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. This phenomenon shows that social and environmental factors play a crucial role in influencing mental well-being. Therefore, a holistic approach that considers these aspects is essential for achieving optimal mental well-being.
Working Principles
The working principles of Mental Well-being Theory involve several key steps. First, it is important to recognize and manage emotions healthily. Second, building and maintaining positive and supportive social relationships is crucial. Third, creating an environment conducive to mental well-being, including comfortable work and home spaces, is essential. The theory also emphasizes the importance of physical activity, good nutrition, and adequate rest as part of a holistic approach to maintaining mental well-being.
Indicators
Key indicators of this theory include stress levels, sleep quality, life satisfaction, and emotional health. Other indicators include the quality of social relationships, the ability to cope with stress, and daily energy levels. These indicators can be measured through mental well-being surveys, interviews, and behavioral observations in various contexts. These indicators help evaluate the extent to which individuals achieve and maintain their mental well-being.
Operational Variables
Operational variables of Mental Well-being Theory include measuring stress levels, sleep quality, and the quality of social relationships. These variables can be measured through surveys, self-assessments, and health data analysis. This data provides insights into how individuals manage their mental health and how interventions can be designed to enhance mental well-being.
Application Areas
The theory can be applied in various fields such as Human Resource Management (HRM), Psychology, Education, Social Communication, and Health. In HRM, the theory helps develop programs that support employee mental well-being and improve job performance. In Psychology, the theory is useful for understanding how individuals can enhance their mental well-being and develop interventions to address mental health issues. In Education, the theory supports the development of curricula that promote student mental well-being. In Social Communication, the theory guides strategies to enhance community engagement and mental well-being. In Health, the theory helps design programs that support patients in managing their mental health conditions and improving their quality of life.
Determining Factors
The success of applying this theory is determined by several key factors. Support from the social and organizational environment is crucial for creating conditions that support mental well-being. Additionally, the availability of adequate training and resources to develop stress and emotion management skills is key. Success is also influenced by the individual's ability to utilize available resources and opportunities to enhance their mental well-being.
Implementation and Strategies
Implementing this theory requires a structured and ongoing approach. The first step is to identify mental well-being needs and develop appropriate programs. Effective strategies include providing training on stress and emotion management, developing policies that support mental well-being, and creating mechanisms for feedback and evaluation. Continuous evaluation and adjustment of strategies based on individual feedback are vital to ensuring long-term success.
Supporting and Hindering Challenges
Challenges in applying this theory include resistance to change, a lack of understanding of the importance of mental well-being, and limited resources to develop and implement mental well-being programs. However, with strong support from the social and organizational environment, as well as ongoing education, these challenges can be overcome. Success also depends on the ability to create environments that support individual engagement and mental well-being, and the ability to manage conflicts and barriers that may arise in the process of developing mental well-being.
Conclusion
Mental Well-being Theory emphasizes the importance of mental well-being in achieving a balanced and productive life. The theory provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and facilitating mental well-being across various fields. With proper application, this theory can help individuals and organizations improve their mental well-being, better face challenges, and create positive impacts on quality of life and performance.

An Examination of the Moderating Effects of Perceived Control on the Relationship Between Trauma Exposure in Childhood and Cognitive Health in Adulthood,"Existing literature has identified a relationship between childhood trauma and changes in cognitive health in later life. Specifically, trauma exposure has been shown to predict change in both executive function (EF; a set of skills that allow for planning, focusing attention, and working memory) and episodic memory (EM; a type of long-term recall memory that involves the recollection of prior experiences), such that individuals with greater numbers of trauma exposure experienced greater rates of cognitive decline in both cognitive domains than those with fewer exposures (Lynch &amp; Lachman, 2020). Similarly, it is known that PTSD may have adverse effects on cognition such that individuals who have experienced PTSD are more likely to experience cognitive impairments than those who have not (Golier et al., 200; Quershi et al., 2011). While it is clear that trauma exposure is a risk factor for cognitive decline in adulthood, it is unclear what factors may act as a buffer in this relationship and protect against the deleterious effects of childhood trauma. Perceived control, or the extent to which one believes that their actions can evoke desirable outcomes (Lachman, 2006), is an important psychosocial resource for cognitive health (Neupert &amp; Allaire, 2012; Cerino et al., 2020) that may serve as a potential buffer against these deleterious effects. This research seeks to examine the extent to which perceived control moderates the relationship between exposure to potentially traumatic events (PTEs) in childhood and cognitive health in adulthood. We will address a current gap in the literature, as no studies to date have investigated the effects of control beliefs on the relationship between PTE exposure in childhood and cognitive health.
The current study will use secondary data from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study. The following research questions will be addressed: First, to what extent does perceived control moderate the relationship between childhood PTE exposure and level of cognitive function (EF, EM)? Second, to what extent does perceived control moderate the relationship between childhood PTE exposure and rate of change in cognitive function (EF, EM)?",step2,True
Ideal Worker Evaluations,"The purpose of this study is to better understand how individuals perceive, and react to, leave taking behaviors of employees and use of workplace policies by employees.

Second, we examine how workplace culture can influence how leave taking influences perceptions of employees as ideal workers. 

Third, we examine the extent to which the perception that an employee deviates from the ideal worker norm leads to negative consequences for the employee.

Discrimination in the Credential Society: An Audit Study of Race and College Selectivity in the Labor Market,"Racial inequality in economic outcomes, particularly among the college-educated, persists throughout U.S. society.  Scholars debate whether this inequality stems from racial differences in human capital (e.g. college selectivity, GPA, college major) or employer discrimination against black job candidates.  However, limited measures of human capital and the inherent difficulties in measuring discrimination using observational data make determining the cause of racial differences in labor market outcomes a difficult endeavor.  In this research, I examine employment opportunities for white and black graduates of elite top-ranked universities versus high-ranked but less selective institutions.  Using an audit design, I create matched candidate pairs and apply for 1,008 jobs on a national job search website.  I also exploit existing birth record data in selecting names to control for differences across social class within racialized names.  The results show that although a credential from an elite university results in more employer responses for all candidates, black candidates from elite universities only do as well as white candidates from less selective universities.  Moreover, race results in a double penalty: when employers respond to black candidates it is for jobs with lower starting salaries and lower prestige than those of white peers.  These racial differences suggest that a bachelor’s degree, even one from an elite institution, cannot fully counteract the importance of race in the labor market.  Thus, both discrimination and differences in human capital contribute to racial economic inequality.",step2,True
In the name of the father? Attitudes towards the double surname and the role of social norms in Italy,"Transmitting the paternal surname to children is a deep-rooted custom that has been in force in most patrilineal societies for centuries. Often, it is also a legal norm. This de facto practice is found in many national legal systems with some significant exceptions such as Spain or Portugal. On a symbolic level, it speaks very eloquently of the gender inequality that persists in a society because it makes maternal identity invisible. Despite this obvious symbolic relevance, the question of children’s surnames has rarely been investigated in the sociological literature. Inspired by a recent ruling by the Italian Constitutional Court on the transmission of surnames of both parents, the project aims to fill this gap in empirical research.  

This study investigates attitudes towards the use of the double surname in Italy. It does so by means of two survey experiments. The first one concerns the role of social norms intended as rules of behavior that individuals prefer to follow because of the normative and empirical expectations they hold about their reference network’s beliefs and behaviors (see Bicchieri 2016). Applied to the case of children’s surname, it means that parents might refrain from giving a double surname, even when legally possible, because they believe other people give the paternal surname and they believe others in their reference network would like them to give the paternal surname. We want to test whether changing expectations through the manipulation of a hypothetical scenario affects subjects’ propensity to give a double surname. 

The second experiment, embedded in the same survey, evaluates the role of a common justification provided for not adopting the double surname: its length and/or unpleasant sound. We argue that such justification could instead hide the unwillingness to violate the norm of the paternal surname. Thus, we will test whether the propensity to (not) adopt the double surname depends on the available alternatives, i.e. either the paternal surname (normative choice) or the maternal surname (counter-normative choice), and the quality of the two names combination making the double surname",step2,True
New Insights into Rental Housing Markets across the United States: Web Scraping and Analyzing Craigslist Rental Listings,"Current sources of data on rental housing – such as the census or commercial databases that focus on large apartment complexes – do not reflect recent market activity or the full scope of the U.S. rental market. To address this gap, we collected, cleaned, analyzed, mapped, and visualized 11 million Craigslist rental housing listings. The data reveal fine-grained spatial and temporal patterns within and across metropolitan housing markets in the U.S. We find some metropolitan areas have only single-digit percentages of listings below fair market rent. Nontraditional sources of volunteered geographic information offer planners real-time, local-scale estimates of rent and housing characteristics currently lacking in alternative sources, such as census data.",step2,True
Work and Workers in International Markets,"Abstract
               Four “problems” drive the International Political Economy (IPE) literature on work and workers in a globalized world: the economic determinants of workers’ political orientations; the role and future of labor unions; the regulation and governance of international supply chains; and migration. There remain walled gardens in the IPE literature on labor that inhibit productive exchange but the literature on supply chain governance and labor standards stands out for its policy relevance and active collaboration among scholars from different IPE traditions. The chapter concludes with reflections on how the implicit definition of “problems,” as opposed to explicit normative claims might not be “first best.”",step2,True
"Competition, market concentration and innovation in Ecuador","The objective is to determine how market concentration affects firms’ decisions
to innovate. With company-level data l from the 2010 Ecuadorian economic
census , a probabilistic/linear model was calculated with correction for selection
bias. Ecuadorian companies have a limited innovation capability and there is a
persistence in market concentration. The estimates confirm the theory of market
power in the propensity to innovate for both models. Consequently, increased
market share leads to an increase in the likelihood of innovation, thanks to the
ability to exploit the gains from these processes.",step2,True
Innovation and Market Value. The Case of Tourism Enterprises,"In contemporary economics companies operate in a fast changing environment which forces them to adapt constantly. The never ending development seems to constitute the necessary condition for achieving the ultimate purpose of a company’s function - the maximization of shareholder wealth. Company value is the greatest overall measurement of its efficient functioning. Thus numerous approaches to value were created. For public companies the market value of equity changes constantly and is publicly available. Companies actively support the increase in the market value of equity by releasing positive news. In this context the role of innovation announcements is crucial for all companies. Issues concerning innovation are strongly embedded in the current worldwide scientific discussion. However different sectors are unequally represented. The discussion on innovation in low-tech industries and services has received relatively little scholarly attention. Tourism represents both categories. The investigation of innovation in tourism is especially essential for the economy of the European Union as the sector contributes significantly to GDP generation, employment and investment. Increasing the knowledge of innovation in tourism is of vital theoretical and practical importance. Thus it was addressed in the present book. 
 The research problem in the present book was expressed in the following question: what is the relationship between innovation announcements and the market value of equity of tourism enterprises?
 The main objective of the research was to measure the short- and long-term impact of innovation announcements on the market value of equity of tourism enterprises. Research aimed also at creating and verifying empirically the model explaining the relationship between innovation and the market value of tourism enterprises.
 The research contributed to the knowledge on innovation in tourism in two ways. First, the author’s model representing the relationship was created. Second, the empirical research allowed the measurement of the effects of innovation announcements and the verification of the significance of the predictors of the market value of equity. 
 In this research a systematic model-building procedure was applied. It relied on summarizing the existing scientific evidence on the relationship studied in order to build a comprehensive framework whilst also adding the author’s propositions of predictors in the next step. In order to build the exhaustive design the method of systematic literature studies SALSA was employed. The study covered the period between 2000 and 2015. It used five scientific databases. The precise four-step procedure including content analysis and meta-synthesis resulted in the indication of two innovation-level, two firm-level innovation-related and five control variables important in the context of the relationship studied. Seven theoretically related predictors proposed by the author complemented this sound conceptual framework. In total the model accounted for eleven predictors: patent, CSR, type, degree of novelty involved, source, stage and the communication of innovation, R&amp;D intensity and the innovativeness of the implementing company, squared R&amp;D intensity and the interaction between R&amp;D intensity and innovativeness. It covered also 8 control variables: industry, size, volume, total cash dividend, operational experience, leverage, return on equity and growth.
 The empirical research covered all the tourism enterprises listed on the main markets of the most important stock exchanges in the European Union in the period between February 2011 and February 2016. There were 111 such companies. The abnormal changes in the market value of equity resulting from innovation announcements of tourism enterprises constituted the subjects of analysis. Content analysis of the 9,000 innovation announcements resulted in creating the sampling frame of 985 releases referring to innovation consistent with the definition adopted in the present research. The research was performed on the representative sample of 398 observations. 
 As Berk et al. state the total market value of a firm’s equity equals the number of its shares times their current market price [2014]. If the number of shares is constant the change in their price becomes the right proxy for the changes in MV [Damodaran 2012]. In the present study the abnormal change in the market value of equity constituted the dependent variable. In line with the above considerations and previous research it was operationalized as the abnormal return. It was calculated in the short and the long term. In the short term the event-study method was employed. In the long term the buy-and-hold abnormal returns method was used. The expected returns in the short-term study were computed using the Carhart four-factor model [1997]. The abnormal returns were cumulated over the event windows and standardised which led to more powerful tests. The statistical significance of the changes in the market value of equity was tested using the Z-test and the two groups difference of means test.
 In order to test the author’s model response surface regression and hierarchical regression were employed. The first one relies on introducing higher-order and interaction effects. The second one allows the testing of scientific hypotheses on the significance of particular predictors by building successive regression models, each adding new variables. The statistical analysis of the changes in the market value has hardly been reported in previous research. Such a study was performed here. It included the methods of descriptive statistics: central tendency, dispersion, skewness and peakedness.
 The first result of the empirical research reported in the book is the indication of the positive relationship between innovation announcements and the market value of equity of tourism enterprises. In the short term the effect concentrated in the event windows directly surrounding the event. In the +/- 1 day event window, the statistically significant increase in market value of equity was 0,38%. In the 6-months period it was 3,94%.
 The outcomes demonstrated that the initial reaction to the innovation news was adjusted in time. In the short term the market tended to undervalue the announced innovation. The difference in short- and long-term changes in the market value of equity and the statistical significance of the second suggested that the investors did not incorporate the new information immediately and fully. It means that the assessment of the effects of innovation announcements on the market value of equity of tourism enterprises should be considered over a longer period. 
 The research did not deliver supportive evidence for the existence of leakage and dissemination effect. The significant changes in MV occurred in the period following the announcement. The fluctuations of market value of equity in the two days directly preceding the release and in the -6/-1 day event window were statistically insignificant. There is a small risk of significant fluctuations resulting from investors’ aggressive trading prior to the announcement and unwinding part of the acquired position after it. 
 The positive effects of successful innovation announcements were greater in number and magnitude than the negative effects of unsuccessful ones. The difference was statistically significant. In the +/- 1 day event window a typical change in market value of equity fell between 1,92% and -1,5%. In the half-year period the typical area of variability ranged between 16,07% and -8,95%. The distribution of changes in the market value of equity was right-skewed. It indicated that it was more probable to experience a high positive change in the market value of equity than to experience high loss. The leptokurtic character of the distribution showed that more variance resulted from infrequent extreme abnormal returns. 
 The heterogeneity of the changes in the market value of equity required further explanation. In order to study the relationship between innovation announcements and the market value of equity of tourism enterprises the author’s model was tested. The statistical significance of the groups of predictors and of the single predictors was verified.
 The outcomes of the analysis performed with the use of hierarchical regression indicated that innovation-level variables predict the changes in the market value of equity above and beyond the effect of the control and innovation-related company-level variables. The company-level innovation-related variables increased significantly the model’s predictive power in the short term.
 In line with the initial hypothesis the research demonstrated that the effect of product innovation on the changes in market value resulting from innovation announcements was greater than that of other innovation types. New products may directly increase sales and impact positively on the company’s cash flow. Furthermore it pointed out the positive effect of the first innovation announcement in relation to second and further releases. The informative value of the announcements beyond the first one was relatively small and caused little market reaction. In the context of market reactions the delivering of new information is essential. Moreover it was ascertained that in the short term the market rewarded the high advancement of the announced innovation and the high R&amp;D intensity of the announcing company. In the case of hardly innovative tourism enterprises the market responded slightly to the development news and waited for the proof in the form of the innovation introduction. The high level of R&amp;D intensity allowed tourism companies to differentiate themselves and increase innovative capabilities which was positively perceived by investors. In the long term investors acknowledged the positive effects of developing innovation in collaborative structures as it allows companies to benefit from the experience of collaborators and diminishes the risk.
 Furthermore the research delivered some inconclusive indications typified by the statistically insignificant results. The market positively received patented innovation in comparison to the non-patented one but the effect of such protection was relatively small. Patents are especially important for highly advanced technological innovation which is rare in tourism. Besides investors seemed optimistic about the innovation’s degree of novelty involved. In line with the hypothesis they rewarded radical innovation as it carries higher potential benefits but the result was statistically insignificant. In the case of tourism dominated by minor upgrades investors treated radical innovation carefully and followed the “high risk – high return” strategy to a small extent. In line with the prediction in the long term the market seemed to reward highly R&amp;D intensive tourism companies but the result was statistically insignificant. 
 Moreover the research did not deliver supportive evidence for the existence of the second-order effect of R&amp;D intensity and the interaction between R&amp;D intensity and innovativeness. The inclusion of such variables did not predict changes in the market value of equity above and beyond the effect of the control variables. In the long term the diminishing marginal returns to R&amp;D intensity were suggested but the effect was statistically insignificant. It may result from the level of expenditure on R&amp;D in tourism which is too low to strongly advocate the diminishing marginal returns.
 In addition to the above outcomes the research delivered some unexpected results. It seemed that innovation without the elements of CSR was perceived better than innovation carrying such elements. The results were statistically insignificant. First, the CSR elements may have been perceived as superficial. Second, some previous research suggested that in non-innovative companies the concentration on social responsibility instead of enhancing innovativeness leads to a decrease in consumer satisfaction and in turn in market value [Luo and Bhattacharya 2006]. It seems to be the case in tourism.
 The number of innovation announcements released within a year before the event day did not have any impact on the reaction to the current announcement. Investors did not perceive companies reporting numerous innovations better. In the case of tourism enterprises it may result from the relatively high number of minor upgrades. It seems that their implementation did not guarantee the perception of the company as innovative. Each innovation announcement was evaluated irrespectively of such defined innovativeness. The results were statistically insignificant.
 The research did not deliver the supportive evidence for the market to reward the reported high advancement of innovation in the long term. The results were inconclusive due to their statistical insignificance. The research indicated that in the long term the stage of innovation at the moment of release was less important than in the short term. One possible explanation is that the period of six months following the development release might cover also the actual implementation.
 In the short term the effect of innovation developed in-house on the changes in market value resulting from innovation announcements was minimally greater than that of innovation from other sources. The calculated parameter and thus the actual difference were small. In the long term investors did not appreciate tourism companies’ own efforts. 
 The research question was positively answered by indicating the positive impact of innovation announcements on the market value of equity of tourism enterprises. Based on the empirical study all the hypotheses were verified. The study was burdened with several limitations. The research relied on specialist databases. As far as data accessibility is concerned the small amount of information inaccessible through databases required it to be collected directly from companies. Moreover the choice of linear regression modelling might not necessarily allow the capture of all possible effects. Besides which although the advantages of covering the period of relative stability have been discussed in the book the determination of the time frame prevents the generalisation of results in a period of major economic downturns. The research covered comprehensive announcements reporting innovation consistent with the definition adopted. As discussed in the book such an approach offered numerous benefits. However the omission of imprecise, incomplete and partial releases may be considered a certain limitation as this kind of information may also stimulate market reaction to some extent.
 In the light of the results of the present research it seems that a promising direction for further research is the in-depth, qualitative analysis explaining why and how the predictors influenced the market value of equity. It should cover the reasons behind the statistical significance of the predictors demonstrated in this research. Also the growing potential of alternative trading systems suggests the need for the replication of the study in this context. It is especially important for tourism enterprises which are mainly relatively small. Furthermore it seems important to compare the effects of innovation on tourism companies with the effects on other low-tech companies. It could deliver insights into the discussion on the specificity of tourism companies. In the light of the results obtained in this study it seems necessary to deepen the research on the interaction between innovation and corporate social responsibility. The qualitative analysis of the possible synergic effects appears to be a valuable course for further investigation. Value is the most comprehensive measure of company activity. However it is not the only one especially since companies in different periods may pursue different strategies (e.g. profit maximization). The effects of innovation on different financial measures seem to be an important direction for further research.
 The research contributed to the current scientific discussion on innovation in services with special regard to innovation in tourism. It complemented the broader knowledge on the efficiency of capital markets by providing a conceptual overview and empirical evidence. The research introduced the author’s model representing the relationship between innovation announcements and the market value of equity of tourism enterprises. Thus it added to the understanding of the predictors of the market value of equity. The research was based on a representative sample and provided firm support for previous research indicating the positive effects of innovation on tourism companies.",step2,True
Perceived and Ideal Inequality in University Endowments in the United States,"Whether and which university to attend are among the most financially consequential choices most people make. Universities with relatively larger endowments can offer better education experiences, which can drive inequality in students’ subsequent outcomes. We first explore three interrelated questions: the current educational inequality across U.S. universities; people’s perceptions of this inequality; and their desired inequality. Educational inequality is large: the top 20% of universities has 80% of the total university endowment wealth while the bottom 20% has around 1%. Studies 1-3 demonstrated that people underestimate university endowment inequality and desire more equality. These perceptions and ideals were mostly unaffected by contextual factors (e.g., salience of endowment consequences, distribution range) and were not well explained by participants’ demographics. Finally, Study 4 revealed that learning about current endowment inequality decreased tolerance of the distribution of university wealth. We discuss the implications of awareness of educational inequality for behaviors and educational policies.",step2,True

Unemployment benefits and formality in the Brazilian labor market,"Title in Portuguese: Seguro-desemprego e formalidade no mercado de trabalho brasileiro

Abstract: This paper analyzes the relationship between unemployment benefits and formal employment in the Brazilian labor market. The central hypothesis is that these policies have a negative impact on the incidence of formal employment, after receiving the benefits. The databases used are the 1999–2009 Brazilian household surveys (PNAD). Logistic regression models were estimated, in order to evaluate the effect of unemployment benefits on the Brazilian labor market. The dependent variable indicates the occurrence of formal employment for workers. In addition to a set of independent variables (survey year, region of residence, census area, sex, race, age and education), the models include a public policy evaluation variable (unemployment benefits), as well as variables to analyze the trend of this public policy over time. After receiving unemployment benefits, the incidence of formal employment among workers decreases by 42%. The analysis of interactive terms indicates that increases in the real values of the benefits, held since 1999, have not caused significant effects on the dependent variable.

Resumo: Este trabalho analisa a relação entre seguro-desemprego e emprego formal no mercado de trabalho brasileiro. A hipótese central é de que o recebimento deste benefício tem efeito negativo sobre a formalidade do trabalho no período posterior ao seu recebimento. São usados dados da PNAD (1999-2009). Para avaliar o efeito do seguro-desemprego sobre o mercado de trabalho brasileiro, foram estimados modelos de regressão logística. A variável dependente indica a formalidade no trabalho principal. Além de uma série de variáveis independentes (ano da pesquisa, região de residência, situação censitária, sexo, raça, idade e escolaridade), os modelos contêm uma variável de avaliação de política pública (seguro-desemprego) e variáveis para analisar a tendência desta política pública no decorrer do tempo. O recebimento do benefício do seguro-desemprego apresenta efeito negativo de 42% sobre a formalidade no trabalho principal no momento posterior ao recebimento do benefício. A análise dos termos interativos permite indicar que reajustes dos valores do benefício, realizados desde 1999, não causaram efeitos relevantes na formalização do trabalho.",step2,True

Investigating whether subjective neighborhood ratings mediate the relationship between objective built and social environment characteristics and cognitive decline,"Previous research demonstrates that environmental factors are drivers of late-life cognitive health outcomes. Recent review papers have noted how both the physical/built environment (BE) (Besser et al., 2017; Cassarino &amp; Setti, 2015) and social environment (SE) (Peterson et al., 2021) affect late-life cognitive functioning through community-level exposure to risk and protective factors. However, most prior studies have focused on objective, census-based variables rather than subjective measures of how an individual perceives the quality of their own neighborhood (Sullivan et al., 2023). Research from HRS examining the effect of neighborhood perceptions on cognitive outcomes has found that greater perceived physical disorder was associated with worse episodic memory while lower perceived social cohesion was associated with worse semantic fluency (Zaheed et al. 2019). Other studies found that perceived neighborhood quality was more strongly associated with self-rated health status (Weden et al. 2008) and cognition (Lee &amp; Waite, 2018) compared to objective measures (e.g., census-based neighborhood affluence, census-based neighborhood disadvantage, crime rates, interviewer ratings) and even mediates the association between objective neighborhood conditions and health (Weden et al. 2008). In addition, individuals may be differentially impacted by their environments due to the effects of structural racism which shape contextual factors and access to health-promoting resources and contribute to health inequities. One study found that education level moderated the association between neighborhood perceptions and cognitive functioning within different racial/ethnic groups such that among Black adults poorer perceived neighborhood quality was associated with worse cognition among those with higher levels of education compared to those with less education while the opposite was true for White adults (Thierry et al. 2021). Hence, higher education did not buffer against the deleterious effects on cognition of living in a less favorable neighborhood environment for Black adults as it did for White adults. Further clarification is also needed to understand how resiliency operates within minoritized populations, especially those residing in ethnic enclaves, where greater social capital and support may protect against the deleterious effects of living in a highly deprived neighborhood (Sullivan et al., 2023). For example, one study found that Hispanic older adults living in neighborhoods with higher physical disorder had significantly decreased dementia risk compared to White older adults who exhibited greater risk associated with higher physical disorder (Wong &amp; Wang, 2022). The present study plans to utilize longitudinal psychosocial and cognitive data from the Health and Retirement Study in conjunction with public contextual data sources to enhance our understanding of the ways in which objective and subjective measures of neighborhood context may influence cognitive aging outcomes within different racial/ethnic groups.",step2,True

Micronesian States Natural Resource Law Features,"
 The object of the study is the relations of environmental management in the Micronesian states, the subject is the legislation and doctrine in the field of exploitation of natural resources of the countries of Micronesia: Wake Island, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariinsky Islands, the Territory of Guam, the possessions of the United States of America. The author examines the features of the state natural resource mechanism in the listed jurisdictions. The article examines the institution of ownership of natural resources, the permissive procedure for the use of natural objects. In addition, the author addresses the problems of implementing the norms of international maritime law, explores the legal regime of the Micronesian waters. The work completes the ""Oceanic Sonata"" in the theory of natural resource law of foreign countries and takes it to the next scientific level, qualitatively raising the ""bar"" for followers. The relevance of the research is due to the theoretical and practical significance of the content of the article, which reflects domestic interests in Oceania. The author in the article operated with dialectical, logical, historical, formal legal, comparative legal, deduction, induction and other methods of cognition.  The scientific novelty of the presented work lies in the originality of the conclusions and the work itself, which contains fundamentally new information on the subject of research. Legal publications about Micronesia are insignificant, ""living classics"" is presented to your attention - one of the few Russian scientific articles about this Pacific region, while the available works are largely outdated, and some jurisdictions are covered in the domestic sciences for the first time. The author discusses with foreign scientists, analyzing foreign doctrine and legislation, and suggests using the experience of the United States of America in the Russian Federation. At the same time, violations of the norms of international maritime law in the Pacific Ocean are noted, as well as cases of declaring the existence of an exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf of the United States of America in the waters of sovereign States and unoccupied atolls, but also their inclusion in the American Empire as possessions of the United States of America, acting as a possessor of other States.

"Environment, Business and the Firm","AbstractFrom wind turbines and renewable energy landscapes to environmental talks at the UN summits in Copenhagen (2009) and Cancún (2010), there is growing interest in the links between business and the environment. Much geographical work has critically focused on state‐environment links, while economic geographers have attempted to theorize the emergence of markets and economies, in part through understanding the economy through a relational, cultural lens. However, while there has been significant work on critical approaches to the environment and capitalism, there has been a lack in explicit focus on the firm and its role, firstly, in mediating economic‐environmental relations, and secondly in the production of specific environmental outcomes. Drawing on literatures on cultural political economy (CPE), Science and Technology Studies (STS), Actor Network Theory (ANT) and political ecology, the paper argues for a reincorporation of the firm into critical work on the environment in geography, and proposes three ways in which the firm can be usefully theorized in such work: as a relational economic and cultural actor, as a sociotechnical mediator, and as the producer of hybrid socionatures.",step2,True
Beyond the Great Recession: Labor Market Polarization and Ongoing Fertility Decline in the United States,"In the years since the Great Recession, social scientists have anticipated that economic recovery in the U.S., characterized by gains in employment and median household income, would augur a reversal of declining fertility trends. However, the expected post-recession rebound in fertility rates has yet to materialize. In this study, I propose an economic explanation for why fertility rates have continued to decline regardless of improvements in conventional economic indicators. I argue that ongoing structural changes in U.S. labor markets have prolonged the financial uncertainty that leads women and couples to delay or forego childbearing. Combining statistical and survey data with restricted use vital registration records, I examine how cyclical and structural changes in metropolitan-area labor markets were associated with changes in total fertility rates (TFR) across racial/ethnic groups from the early 1990s to the present day, with a particular focus on the period between 2006-2014. The findings suggest that changes in industry composition – specifically, the loss of manufacturing and construction businesses – have a larger effect on TFR than changes in the unemployment rate for all racial/ethnic groups. Since structural changes in labor markets are more likely to be sustained over time, in contrast to unemployment rates which fluctuate with economic cycles, further reductions in unemployment are unlikely to reverse declining fertility trends.",step2,True

Monopolistic Competition and Economic Realism,"From one of the outstanding theorists in the field of economics to-day, Professor Pigou himself, we have the statement that, if economics is to be more than “merely an amusing toy”, it must be “realistic”, in the sense that its “interest is concentrated upon the world known in experience”, and “fruit-bearing”, in the sense that its ultimate objective is to contribute to the attainment of “practical results in social improvement”. Few will disagree with a general statement of this sort; yet none of us can fail to be conscious of the difficulties involved in maintaining a really close and useful relationship between our theoretical analyses and the most urgent practical problems of the economic world around us. It is with these difficulties and with the effect upon them of recent theoretical developments that this paper is primarily concerned.",step2,True
Identifying the effect of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program eligibility/purchasing-power policies on labor-market and health outcomes,"This project will use the Federal Statistical Research Data Center (FSRDC) system to link restricted-use SNAP and WIC micro-level administrative datasets to the 2000 Decennial Census, 2010 Decennial Census, 2005-present American Community Survey (ACS), and the Social Security Administration Numident file. Summarizing this project’s activities, after initial data linkages, we will develop descriptive analysis on the relationship between SNAP distribution dates and labor market and health outcomes. Then, this project will leverage program eligibility cutoffs for SNAP, and program policy variation in SNAP-Ed to causally identify the effect of SNAP/WIC on labor market (e.g., employment and income) and health outcomes (e.g., hospitalization and mortality). Despite the restricted-use micro-level SNAP/WIC datasets being non-comprehensive in terms of state-year coverage, we have identified several examples of program administration variation (with the state-years available) that we can leverage to estimate causal effects. There are three main analyses in this study, which is funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Food and Health Research Using the Consumer Food Data System 2022 CFP. First, the effect of WIC age eligibility cutoff on labor market and health outcomes. Children younger than 5 are eligible for WIC. This project will use a Regression Discontinuity Design to compare WIC-using individuals who are just young enough to still be eligible to former WIC individuals who are just too old. We will test outcomes for both child and parent. We hypothesize increased parental labor market participation and income, as well as increased hospitalization and mortality (for both the parent and the child). We will compare with other econometric designs. Second, we will examine the effect of SNAP work requirements on labor market and health outcomes. SNAP has two work requirements. This project will use a Regression Discontinuity Design to compare SNAP-users who are just old enough to be excused from the WRs to individuals just young enough to not be excused. We hypothesize increased eligibility reduces labor market participation and income, but may also reduce hospitalization and mortality. Third, we will examine the effect of the SNAP education (SNAP-Ed) Program. The goal of SNAP-Ed to teach people how to make SNAP dollars effective through nutrition education classes, social marketing campaigns, etc. SNAP-Ed is implemented through partnerships with state and local organizations, which creates state, county, and year administration variation. We will use standard TWFE DID and dynamic estimates to examine the effect of a variety of policies on labor market and health outcomes. For example, we hypothesize that the use of SNAP will increase in the years after a county is targeted for SNAP-Ed, as will labor market and health outcomes. Furthermore, the extensive longitudinal micro-level linkages will facilitate the examination of specific mechanisms for observed effects, such as educational attainment, family formation, migration, and hospitalization, all of which are testable.",step2,True
Trade Sensitive Manufacturing Employment: Some New Insights," Persistent trade deficits in the United States since 1971, and growing foreign competition have revived debate about the net effects of trade on the domestic economy. Focusing on the employment consequences of trade, this study examines the demographic and industrial characteristics of trade sensitive manufacturing industries in the United States. The findings reveal two significant trends. Firstly, there has been a decline in the importance of high-tech manufacturing as a source of trade related employment opportunities since 1975. Secondly, while trade enhanced industries still employ relatively fewer women and minorities than industries adversely affected by trade, the gap has narrowed, especially for women. Since 1975, the proportion of all women employed in adversely affected industries actually declined; for every 1 percent decline in female employment in an adversely affected manufacturing industry there was a corresponding 0.6 percent gain in employment in a trade-enhanced manufacturing industry.

Immigration and Intimate Partner Violence,"Drawing from a feminist and ecological perspective, intimate partner violence, also known as domestic violence, is abuse that occurs in intimate relationships regardless of culture, race/ethnicity, or sexual orientation and involves behaviors used by one person to gain or maintain power and control over the other person. These types of abuse and characteristics of abuse include psychological, physical, sexual, verbal, or economic abuse, or isolation. Targeted victims in intimate partner violence incidences are predominantly women. According to the ecological model, intimate partner violence manifests at four levels, including individual, relationship, community, and societal. During the 1970s in the United States, recognition of intimate partner violence as a community problem affecting millions of American Caucasian women was apparent. Since that time increasing numbers of foreign-born individuals have resulted in increased prevalence of intimate partner violence among different groups of women (e.g., African women, Asian women, Southeast Asian women, Latinas, immigrant women, refugees) living in the United States. In addition, the intersection between intimate partner violence and immigration-related implications has increased for one particular group of women living in the United States: immigrant Latinas (i.e., approximately one in three Latinas have experienced physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime). This is partly due to the increase of Latinos migrating to the United States from Mexico, Central American countries, and other Spanish-speaking countries. According to the 2016 US census, Latinos are the largest and fastest-growing minority group in the United States. The majority of Latinos currently reside in large states and distinct geographical parts of the United States (e.g., California, Texas, New York, Southwestern and Eastern states). In the early 21st century, the Southeastern (e.g., state of North Carolina) and Midwestern (e.g., state of Iowa) parts of the United States have seen an increase in the Latino population. The criminal justice system’s involvement and efforts to mitigate intimate partner violence among migrant populations are noteworthy.",step2,True
The Relation between Business Property Values and Local Property Taxes,"ABSTRACT
               This study examines the relation between commercial and industrial property values and local property taxes using 1999 to 2009 data for the state of Georgia. Results show a negative relation between commercial values and property taxes, consistent with the new view of capital tax prediction that these taxes are borne, at least in part, by property owners. Incidence estimates show very high to full capitalization. There is little evidence of a relation between industrial property values and property taxes, contrary to prior research. This study is the first to provide empirical evidence of differences in commercial and industrial property tax incidence. The study contributes to the understanding of the capitalization of business taxes, which has been the subject of very little prior research. The results can inform policymakers who consider trade-offs in tax revenue needs, economic development, and issues of fairness in their localities.",step2,True
Global Commodity Chains and Global Value Chains,"A commodity chain refers to “a network of labor and production processes whose end result is a finished commodity.” The attention given to this concept has quickly translated into an expanding body of global chains literature. Research into global commodity chains (GCC), and later global value chains (GVC), is an endeavor to explain the social and organizational structure of the global economy and its dynamics by examining the commodity chains of a specific product of service. The GCC approach first emerged in the mid-1980s from world-system research and was reformulated in the early 1990s by development scholars. The development-oriented GCC approach turned the focus of GCC analysis to actor-centered processes in the global economy. One of the initial criticisms facing the GCC approach was its exclusive focus on internal conditions and organizational linkages, lacking systemic attention to the effect of domestic institutions and internal capacity on economic development. Other critics pointed to the narrow scope of GCC research. With the huge expansion in global chains literature in the past decade—not only in volume but also in depth and scope—efforts have been made to elaborate the global chains framework and to render it industry neutral, as partly reflected in the adoption of the term “global value chains.” Three key research themes surround these recent evolutions of global chains literature: GVC governance, “upgrading,” and the social construction of global value chains. Existing literature, however, still has theoretical and methodological gaps to redress.",step2,True
Building a Smarter Safety-Net: Evidence of Offsets between the SNAP and Medicaid Programs,"There is a growing consensus that reducing health inequalities requires not only
improvements in how we provide medical care, but also addressing the social
determinants of health at the root of inequalities. There is, however, less evidence on
how government-funded social service programs, many of which are designed to
address social determinants, interact to affect health. In this proposal, we examine
whether changes in SNAP eligibility, an important source of nutritional assistance for
many low-income families, impact patterns of health service use and health outcomes
among Medicaid beneficiaries. To do this, we construct a novel data linkage of
administrative Medicaid and SNAP datasets. Using this linked data, we will evaluate two
natural experiments that lead low-income families to acquire or lose SNAP benefits. In
the first experiment, we use a regression discontinuity design to estimate the effect of
acquiring SNAP on care and outcomes for the near-elderly. In the second experiment, we
leverage enrollment term limits to estimate the effect of the loss of SNAP benefits on
intermediate health outcomes. In a related set of policy simulations, we examine the
effects of SNAP eligibility on joint state spending across the SNAP and Medicaid
programs collectively. We also examine the impact of SNAP eligibility on income-based
disparities in health. These analyses will yield actionable information for policymakers in
two key ways. First, it provides much needed comprehensive evidence on the state-level
return to investments in SNAP, an important parameter for policymakers. Second, it
directly informs existing federal policy proposals that threaten to reduce the generosity
of the SNAP program.",step2,True
International Trade Friction and Firm Disclosure Tone: Evidence from China," Synopsis  The research problem  This study examines whether international trade friction has an impact on firm disclosure tone.  Motivation  The past two decades have witnessed a large amount of trade friction worldwide. Under this background, the impact of trade friction on microenterprises is of great concern to researchers. Previous studies have shown that trade friction is related to firm operating or financial activities such as performance, investment, stock prices, loan financing, and employment. However, there are no published papers about how trade friction impacts the disclosure behaviors of firms subject to the friction. This study attempts to fill this void by investigating whether firms manage disclosure tone when they are subject to trade friction.  The test hypotheses  We test two competing hypotheses in this study. Our first hypothesis is that firms impacted by trade friction increase the positive tone of their information disclosure. Second, firms impacted by trade friction decrease the positive tone of their information disclosure.  Target population  This study should be of interest to firm managers, investors, creditors, and policy makers.  Adopted methodology  Ordinary least squares regressions and archival data.  Analyses  We conducted this study by using a sample of listed firms in China. Over the past two decades, China has been the world’s largest country subject to trade frictions. In addition, China’s weak institutional environment and language habit provide an ideal setting for this study. Firm disclosure tone is measured as the frequency difference between the positive and negative words scaled by total words in an annual report. We tested whether there is a positive/negative association between trade friction and firm disclosure tone.  Findings  We find that firms strategically increase their positive tone in annual reports when they are subject to trade friction. Further analyses reveal that the impact of trade friction on disclosure tone is more pronounced for smaller firms, firms with more financial constraints, and firms with less analyst following. In addition, this impact is attenuated when firms have stronger corporate governance. Finally, we show that using more positive tones help firms subject to trade friction improve short-term market valuation, obtain more bank loans, and have lower cost of debt. ",step2,True

Exploring Neighborhood-Level Environmental Justice to Tackle County-Level Disparities in Breast Cancer Outcomes,"Breast cancer is a disease in which cells, originating from the breast epithelium, grow out of control and form tumors. The progression of breast cancer can vary, and its severity is often categorized by stages ranging from early, localized forms to more advanced stages involving widespread dissemination. Breast cancer cases can be hereditary or non-hereditary; Hereditary cases are caused by a penetrant gene mutation: one that is pathogenic and has the potential to promote the development of cancer whereas non-hereditary cases can be caused by a variety of day-to-day exposures affected by socioeconomic disparities and health literacy rates. Despite scientific and technological advancements, researchers and health officials still do not know enough about the disease and breast cancer incidence rates in the United States have steadily increased. This literature review aims to synthesize the relationship between breast cancer health outcomes and environmental justice, health literacy, and socioeconomic disparities. This relationship was first examined from a county-level in the state of Florida. We first examined three Florida counties with varying socioeconomic profiles (Broward, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach) and then examined neighborhoods within the county of Miami-Dade (selected because it has the highest breast cancer rates out of all Florida counties). This examination revealed higher incidences of breast cancer in Latinx and African American communities with high environmental exposures and lower socioeconomic statuses. The identification of specific neighborhoods primarily affected by environmental exposures and low socioeconomic statuses emphasizes the need for neighborhood level modeling to inform future breast cancer research and intervention strategies.",step2,True

The Geography of Gentrification and Residential Mobility,"AbstractGentrification research often starts with the hypothesis that gentrification causes displacement of a neighborhood’s original residents, particularly low-income and vulnerable residents. Recent research based on large-scale quantitative data suggests that the displacement effects of gentrification for low-income residents evident from case studies and qualitative data are modest at the macroscale. We use geocoded microdata from the American Community Survey to investigate the association between gentrification and residential mobility in the 2010s, the time period following the Great Recession. Our large national sample allows us to consider heterogeneity in the association between gentrification and residential mobility, investigating differential association by distinct clusters of metropolitan areas. We find a modest positive significant association between moderate and intense gentrification and residential mobility in our full national sample. The national estimates, however, mask considerable heterogeneity in the association between gentrification and residential mobility in different types of metropolitan areas. College Town and Retirement Destination metros see the largest positive association between gentrification and residential mobility, while Large Coastal and Large Southern/Midwestern metros experience a more modest positive association. We find weak or no significant association in Inland Empire/Texas Border metros. We heed a call for more investigation of heterogeneity in neighborhood processes across different contexts.",step2,True
School Closures and Rural Population Decline*,"AbstractSince 1998, more than 6,000 public schools have closed in rural U.S. counties. Very little research considers how these school closures impact the future growth (or decline) of rural communities. Given rural schools' importance to parents, local labor markets, and civic life, closures could trigger or reinforce population loss. On the other hand, the configuration of schools may simply be a consequence of population loss and not a cause. This paper tests these hypotheses using records from the Common Core of Data (CCD) and U.S. Census. Employing an instrumental variable analysis that exploits exogenous variation in school district boundaries and a difference‐in‐difference design that groups counties by propensity scores, I find that school closures induce population loss in many—but not all—cases. Specifically, counties with the lowest propensities to close schools experience the largest negative effects on population. This finding suggests that policymakers often overlook potentially important unintended consequences of school consolidation in rural communities.",step2,True
The effect of rural school closures on population,"Since 1998, more than six thousand public schools have closed in rural U.S. counties. Very little research asks how these school closures impact the future growth (or decline) of rural communities. Given that school districts are often the leading employers in rural areas, closures could trigger or reinforce population loss. On the other hand, rural reformers in the past have advocated for school consolidation as a way to transform rural communities into more centralized and sustainable places that retain more residents over the long run. Finally, the configuration of schools may simply be a consequence of population loss and not a cause. This paper tests these three hypotheses using records from the Common Core of Data (CCD) and U.S. Census. I employ an instrumental variable analysis that exploits exogenous variation in school district boundaries and a difference-in-difference design of matched counties.",step2,True
Global agricultural supply chains under tariff‐rate quotas," The tariff rate quota (TRQ) is a widely utilized market access instrument in global agricultural trade that allows a predetermined quantity of a product to be imported at a lower tariff rate than the usual rate. This study examines the design and administration of TRQ systems from an operations management perspective and analyzes their impact on market access, fill rates, and revenue for policymakers. We investigate the two most common TRQ administration methods, namely, licensing and first‐come, first‐served (FCFS) systems. We characterize the Nash equilibria (NE) of importers' strategies and observe how information delays and lead times can result in under‐utilization (i.e., imports being less than the quota limit) in licensing and over‐utilization (i.e., imports exceeding the quota limit) in FCFS TRQ systems. We introduce a dual TRQ system and demonstrate its superiority over licensing and FCFS systems. We study the effects of stock‐keeping options through customs‐bonded warehouses and the choice of logistics channels on arrival patterns and fill rates. We conduct a case study of the United Kingdom and the European Union imported beef market using customs data. Our numerical study provides an explanation for the suboptimality of the current TRQ systems and proposes modifications to transform the existing systems. Our findings offer practical directions for agricultural traders to reassess their supply chain strategies by considering the logistical implications of TRQ systems and understanding their competition. This study also urges policymakers to adopt an integrative approach in (re)designing TRQ systems, recognizing the pivotal role of supply chains in global agricultural trade. ",step2,True

Thirdly, the crisis has led to an unparalleled impact on the openness of international borders, with many questioning the sustainability of open borders and pointing out international flows of people as spreaders of the pandemic. 

In these extraordinary times, elections become even more unpredictable than usual. Here we argue that there is not just one expected impact of the Coronavirus outbreak on the electoral fate of Donald Trump. Based on classic theories of voting behavior, we expect that some aspect of this crisis might help him, while others might harm him. More specifically, this project tests which aspect related to the global pandemic will impact the vote for Donald Trump and why. 

The research question motivating our study is important for two reasons. Firstly, the vote drivers for Donald Trump, an atypical candidate in recent American history, are still a matter of controversy in political science (Hooghe and Dassonneville 2018). The significance of the Trump administration for the nature of American values and resilience of liberal democracy are a matter of intense debate, highlighting the importance of this case study. Moreover, Trump’s double status as both a populist outsider and a presidential incumbent make this case particularly interesting. While populist entrepreneurs are expected to benefit from some forms of economic anxiety and disaffection with the political system (De Vries and Hobolt 2020), incumbent candidates are expected to be electorally punished in bad economic times (Duch and Stevenson 2008). Disentangling which of these dynamics is at play is an empirical question to be resolved.

Secondly, this research question is also relevant for comparative scholars and beyond the specific interest on Trump’s electoral fortunes. The impact of economic and political crises on populist radical right and anti-immigrant narratives remains surprisingly controversial in previous scholarly literature. While some authors document a relationship between recessions and populist voting (Jackman and Volpert 1996; Hobolt and Tilley 2016), others find that the relationship is actually negative (Knigge 1998; Arzheimer and Carter 2006), insignificant (Lubbers, Gijsberts and Scheepers 2002), or conditional on other systemic factors (Golder 2003; Arzheimer 2009; Dancygier 2010). Similarly, the literature analyzing public support for liberal democracy has reached contradictory conclusions regarding the impact of the economy (Christmann and Torcal 2017).

The impact of a major economic downturn is one of the central ramifications of the Covid-19 pandemic, and taps into some of the most pressing puzzles in contemporary studies on populism and voting behavior. However, we will also study the impact of other potential channels connecting the pandemic with political outcomes: anxieties about immigration in a global and presumably dangerous world (i.e. narratives about the ‘Chinese virus’ or the virus spreading globally via open borders and international travelling routes), and the political management of the pandemic (with the US having the highest death toll in the world). The role of anti-immigrant reactions is particularly important, as they have been singled out as the main driver of Trump’s victory in 2016 (Hooghe and Dassonneville 2018; Reny et al. 2019). Determining whether economic explanations shape populist voting more or less than cultural anxieties, anti-immigrant attitudes, perceptions of political competence or, simply, partisanship, is an important question for comparative scholars these days.

This study will present the results of a survey experiment in the US manipulating the saliency of economic conditions, immigration flows, and the management of the Covid-19 pandemic on vote intention during the 2020 US Presidential campaign.",step2,True
Oral intake management in laboring woman : A scoping review,"INTRODUCTION
Labor is a period of high fluid and energy expenditure, which may lead to increased pain and negative birth experiences. Insufficient intake of energy during labour may cause maternal hypoglycaemia and augmented lipolysis, increased oxidation of fatty acids and consequently enhanced production of ketone bodies, which has a certain probability of causing prolonged labor, increased cesarean section rate, neonatal hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis and other adverse outcomes. Parturients remain awake during labor and have the ability to express their own will, excessive dietary restrictions may cause negative emotions such as unhappiness and stress.
In 1997, the World Health Organization reviewed existing data and recommends that health care providers should not interfere with a woman’s desire for oral intake during labor. Proper oral intake during labor can help shorten labor process, supplement carbon water and isotonic solution, which can stabilize blood sugar and electrolyte levels, reduce the incidence of hypokalemia. It has also been shown that proper oral intake can in turn improve the stressful state of parturients, which achieve a synergistic effect between mind and body. 
Oral intake includes carbohydrates, sugar-sweetened beverages, high-protein beverages, nutritional preparations, energy beverages, etc. In China, most content of the oral intake management during labor are arranged according to the personal wishes of the women, among which chocolate is the first choice, followed by sport drinks. In addition to chocolate, carbohydrate diet also includes bread, cake, noodles, etc. However, since the intake of solid food is not convenient for emergency cesarean section, it is often not recommended and has not shown significant advantages in many comparative studies. Sugary beverages, including orange juice, grape juice, and honey syrup, can both replenish water and sugar intake for energy, improving maternal metabolism and satisfaction. High-protein beverages such as enteral nutrition preparations, compared to conventional diets, have certain advantages in terms of nutritional value, absorption, portability, and preparation compared to conventional diets.
In 2007, the obstetric guideline of the American Society of Anaesthesiologists published that the oral intake of solids during labour increases maternal complications and solid foods should be avoided in parturients. It also recommended that modest amounts of clear liquids (such as water, clear tea, black coffee and sports drink) may be allowed for uncomplicated parturients. In 2013, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Society of Anesthesiologists recommended the modest amounts of clear liquids may be allowed for uncomplicated parturients but that solid foods should be avoided. Moreover, it also recommended parturients with risk factors for aspiration (such as morbid obesity, diabetes, and difficult airway, or parturients at increased risk for operative delivery) may require further restrictions of oral intake determined on a caseby-case basis. But how to supplement is not yet clear exactly defined.
Several studies tried to identify what types of food and drink are proper for low-risk women in labor. Sperling et al summaried recommendations of professional organizations and proposed, considering the rarity of aspiration events, eating low residue foods (biscuits, toasts, cereals) during labor should not be restricted if low-risk parturients understand the risks and obtain appropriate consent. Ciardulli et al conducted a meta-analysis of 12 studies found that less-restrictive food (mostly carbohydrates) intake is associated with a shorter duration of labor and  does not increase the incidence of vomiting. Kearney et al collated evidence-based guidelines for intrapartum hydration to assess maternal hydration during labor, but no recommendations with respect to assessment and management of hydration for women in labor were found. 
Within this context, the aim of this scoping review was to synthesize the form and content of oral intake management during labour, to identify the impact on birth outcomes and provide a reference for future research and clinical practice.",step2,True
Asian Americans in the Labor Market: Public Policy Issues,"Asian American/Pacific Islander public policy issues in the labor market are examined using the 2000 Census PUMS (Public Use Micro Sample) data.  AAPI labor market problems raised by earlier studies are revisited with the more recent data.  Southeast Asians, Vietnamese, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders continue to face problems of poverty/low income, unemployment, and discrimination in occupations and earnings.  Many API groups are less likely to be employed in managerial occupations controlling for factors such as education and potential experience.  New policy issues suggested by the data are lower rates of self-employment for many APIs compared to non-Hispanic whites as well as lower rates of homeownership by all API groups compared to non-Hispanic whites.",step2,True
Public Health Nationalism? A Pre-Analysis Plan,"China and the United States have pursued substantially different approaches to Covid-
19 policies, with Chinese efforts focused more on minimizing cases even if it means more
restrictions and Americans on minimizing restrictions even if it means more cases. Do
the preferences of their citizens differ as substantially as the policies enacted by their
leaders? If they do differ, to what extent do they reflect top-down (citizens basing
preferences on national cues) versus bottom-up (citizen preferences reflecting personal
ideas about freedom and risk etc.) factors? We explore these questions through a
multistage conjoint design embedded in two parallel surveys conducted in the United
States and China in April and May 2022. In the first stage, respondents are asked to
compare pairs of unnamed, hypothetical Covid-19 policy profiles and indicate which
profile they prefer. In the second stage, we present respondents with profiles of actual policies implemented by the United States and China and ask them to compare
the two. However, the countries are only named in the treatment group; they remain
unnamed in the control group. This two-stage designs allows us to estimate \country
priming effects"" (CPEs), obtained by netting the average marginal component effects
(AMCEs) for policy attributes, estimated in the first stage, from the raw treatment
effects of the second stage. We expect this CPE to be positive on average and that
pairwise difference is the largest for the U.S.-China comparison relative to other pairs
of country comparison. Our study elucidates the role of nationalism in driving citizen
support for public health policies.",step2,True
Methods,"Study design
This study is part of the Work Package 3 of the COST Action CA19101 - Determinants of Physical Activities in Settings (DEPASS). We plan to utilize a four-step modified Delphi method (Niederberger &amp; Spranger, 2020) in our initiative. This terminology consensus study will involve a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. It will be based on the systematic extraction of terminology (definitions) from the literature, as well as feedback received from academics and professionals in relevant areas. The feedback process will entail a systematic reduction of the multiple definitions presented in the literature for each term, resulting in the identification of the most widely accepted definitions.
The original list of 35 determinants, for which we aim to achieve a consensus statement, primarily stems from previous umbrella systematic literature reviews from the project 'Determinants of Diet and Physical Activity' (DEDIPAC). This list has been supplemented with additional systematic reviews concerning determinants of physical activity to ensure comprehensive coverage of all categories (Individual, Biological, Psychological, Behavioural, Environmental, and Socio-cultural). The original list includes the following determinants: age; sex; socioeconomic status; ethnicity; education attainment level; setting; household income; health status; stress; life events; physical fitness; heart rate; body fat; genetic profile and regulation; perceived competency; self-regulation; mental fatigue; motivation/goal setting; perceived behavioral control; enjoyment; self-efficacy; parental (role) modeling; PABs history and patterns; sedentary behaviour; phone usage; independent active mobility; sleep; participation in organised sports; active transport; backyard access/size; green space access; PA provision and ethos in setting; neighbourhood characteristics; provision proximity (parks/playground); access to sport/recreational facilities; time outdoors; availability of physical activity programs and equipment within schools and community; cultural perspective on PAB; group, family and peer support; companionship; social contact.
Stage 1- Panel committee and participants selection

Panel Committee
During the initial online meeting, DE-PASS members will be approached with an invitation to join the Panel Committee. Interested members should possess the required expertise, encompassing both academic knowledge and/or lived experiences. The Panel Committee aims to have representatives with expertise in sports, health, psychological, and social sciences. Furthermore, it's our goal to ensure that the Panel Committee includes members from equity-deserving groups, considering factors such as geographical location, gender, and ethnicity.

Participants selection
We will invite approximately 300 participants from 40 countries who are involved in the DE-PASS project. We anticipate a diverse representation among participants in terms of gender, ethnicity, geographical location, age groups, and occupation. As the DE-PASS Cost Action focuses on determinants of physical activity, all members within this network have an academic and/or practical background related to physical activity and/or the health domain.
Stage 2 - Literature review on definitions
Two types of data sources will be incorporated into this study: 
1. Definitions sourced from the literature through a systematic process, as well as definitions obtained from grey literature, including Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), dictionaries and organizational websites; 
2. The knowledge and perspectives of DE-PASS members, who are academics and practitioners in the fields of sport, health, psychological, and social sciences.

Search strategy
Initially, a systematic search will be conducted in databases including PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and Google Scholar.

The formula used for the search in databases will be applied to each determinant separately, as follows (the specific determinants will substitute the general term ‘determinant’):

((“determinant” was defined as) OR (“determinant” is defined as) OR (“determinant” is described as))

Subsequently, we will examine the potential sources that offer readily available and commonly utilized definitions of determinants. This will predominantly involve searching the MeSH and specialized dictionaries and reports from areas of sport, health, psychological, and social sciences.

Two reviewers (JD and JBS) will screen articles independently and consensus will be reached through discussion. 

All definitions will be gathered in a structured table format with the corresponding references to be used in the next steps (surveys, as described below). In cases where no definition is found, the term will still be included in the surveys.
 
Delphi procedure
Phase I - Preliminary Consensus Round
The initial survey (Survey 1) will be conducted among a Panel committee of six members of the DE-PASS Cost Action with expertise in sport, health, and social sciences. The objective will be to streamline definitions identified from the literature for survey purposes. Members of the group will attempt to select the most appropriate definitions for each determinant. In making their selections, they will adhere to criteria concerning universal applicability and broad relevance, as well as the clarity and comprehensibility of the definitions. Following this, the members will convene for a consensus-building session. Through rigorous discussions, we will aim to finalize up to the top three definitions for each determinant. If no definition is found for a particular determinant, this will be explicitly stated, and the determinant will proceed to the next phase in this manner.

Phase II - Best Definition Identification
This second phase will use a web-based survey (Survey 2) and will be distributed among all DE-PASS members. The Survey 2 will present three definitions (if possible) for each determinant, and the participants will be asked to anonymously select the one they believe best characterizes the given determinant. In the survey, participants will be given the choice to indicate if any of the provided definitions are unsuitable. Additionally, they will have the option to propose an alternative definition (free text option), which must be supported by existing literature, and also provide comments on the presented definitions.
After the completion of Survey 2, each member of the Panel committee will independently analyze the collected data. The analysis process will follow these steps: 1) If a definition is widely accepted as suitable based on the survey results and comments, it will proceed unchanged to the next phase of the project; 2) If a definition is deemed unsuitable, members have the option to refine its wording. In such cases, they will start with the highest-ranked definition from the survey as their base. If the gap between the top-rated definition and the next highest-rated is less than 10%, members may also consider combining elements from multiple definitions to improve clarity and relevance.
During this individual analysis, members should also pay close attention to any alternative definitions submitted in the free-text responses, as well as any additional comments provided by the participants. Any changes made to the definitions should aim to improve their overall clarity, relevance, and comprehensibility, ensuring they can be universally applied.

Phase III – Ranking evaluation
In a web-based Survey 3, participants will be asked to independently rank a total of 35 definitions (one ‘best’ definition per determinant), using a 5-point Likert scale (where 5 represents “strongly agree” and 1 “strongly disagree”). Consensus will be determined a priori to be achieved if ≥75% of participants “strongly agree” or “somewhat agree” with a particular definition.

Once the Survey 3 is completed, we will categorize the definitions of determinants into two groups based on the results and a predetermined threshold. The first group will meet the 75% threshold and will be presented at the expert panel meeting for evaluation.  The second group will not meet this threshold and these definitions will not go forward to the next phase. 

Phase IV – Expert panel meeting
The aim of this meeting is to assemble a conclusive report on the definitions of determinants where consensus has been reached. The meeting will be moderated by the Leader D3.3 (YN). All participants who took part in the previous rounds (Phase II and Phase III) will be invited. If there is an overwhelming interest in joining this panel, candidates will be selected to ensure the final group of 10 experts is sufficiently diverse and balanced. Each proposed definition will be discussed individually by the expert panel, with the goal of achieving a final version through primarily formal adjustments, such as ensuring consistent English usage and maintaining a uniform tone. Furthermore, based on our discussions, we will delineate future directions and pinpoint areas requiring further research.

DATA COLLECTION INSTRUMENTS/TOOLS/PLANS
•	The definitions gathered in the literature review will be integrated in a table. The table will include the list of determinants, the collected definitions for each of them, and the source (e.g., author(s), year of publication, title, DOI).  
•	A web-based questionnaire (Survey 1) with the collected definitions for each determinant will be designed and distributed among the core group, who will be asked to select the three most appropriate definitions. 
•	A web-based questionnaire (Survey 2) will be designed and distributed among DE-PASS members, with up to three definitions provided for each determinant. It is possible that some determinants may have no definitions available, or only one or two definitions. In addition to the three provided definitions, an optional ""other"" answer will be included, asking participants to propose an additional definition and provide a source. In addition, participants will have the possibility of not providing an answer for a particular determinant, if they don’t feel comfortable to do that (‘I prefer not to answer’). The questionnaire will be anonymous. However, participants will only be asked to provide the following background details: age (range), gender, ethnicity, country of living, work setting, level of education, occupation, and area of expertise.
•	A web-based questionnaire (Survey 3) will be created to grade the selected single definition in a 5-point Likert scale. 
•	Referring to both Survey 2 and 3, a Panel Committee will analyze the data to reach agreement on any unresolved definitions.
•	The results of the process will be reported in full and presented according to Literature review requirements.",step2,True
Measuring All-Cause Mortality With the Census Numident File,"Objectives. To assess the quality of population-level US mortality data in the US Census Bureau Numerical Identification file (Numident) and describe the details of the mortality information as well as the novel person-level linkages available when using the Census Numident. Methods. We compared all-cause mortality in the Census Numident to published vital statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We provide detailed information on the linkage of the Census Numident to other Census Bureau survey, administrative, and economic data. Results. Death counts in the Census Numident are similar to those from published mortality vital statistics. Yearly comparisons show that the Census Numident captures more deaths since 1997, and coverage is slightly lower going back in time. Weekly estimates show similar trends from both data sets. Conclusions. The Census Numident is a high-quality and timely source of data to study all-cause mortality. The Census Bureau makes available a vast and rich set of restricted-use, individual-level data linked to the Census Numident for researchers to use. Public Health Implications. The Census Numident linked to data available from the Census Bureau provides infrastructure for doing evidence-based public health policy research on mortality. ",step2,True
How did Covid-19 Affect Logistics Job Vacancy Postings?,"Human resources can differentiate firms from their competitors or directly affect the success or failure of firms. As in many sectors, there is a need for qualified employees in the logistics sector, which is of great importance for the national economies. Qualified employees in this sector contribute to the success of the companies and the development of the industry. In this study, it is aimed to reveal the qualifications and characteristics of the labour force needed by logistics companies. It was also aimed to show the impact of COVID-19 on logistics job ads. For this purpose, a total of 1,410 job vacancy postings (before COVID-19) and a total of 1,700 job vacancy postings (during COVID-19) were searched on the kariyer.net website with the word “logistics” and analysed by content analysis method. As a result, it was found that the most advertised province was Istanbul in both periods, the most looked up experience requirement in the candidates was 1-5 years in both periods, the opportunities provided to the candidates (transportation, food and beverage, career, social activity) were not mentioned much in both periods. This study reveals the status of logistics job postings in the period before COVID-19 and during COVID-19. It was also aimed to show the impact of COVID-19 on logistics job ads. We investigated whether the logistics employee demand has changed and whether the pandemic is affecting workforce characteristics. This is the first empirical analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on logistics vacancy postings.",step2,True
Gender effects in wage negotiations,"Using an online experiment to be run on Prolific.co, we want to investigate how gender affects the negotiation behavior between a worker and a manager. The experiment consists of an effort phase where both managers and workers work on different real effort tasks; both efforts jointly determine total profit. Then, worker and manager negotiate (using a structured wage table and free form chat) how to split the profit between worker (wage) and manager (profit-wage). The experiment comprises two experimental conditions. In the baseline condition, subjects remain unaware of the gender of the partner with whom they are negotiating the wage. In the treatment condition, in contrast, both manager and worker are informed about the gender of their negotiation partner. The study concludes with a questionnaire that contains a set of questions on personality, risk attitudes, and basic demographics. With the data from the experiment we plan to address the following questions: 1) Do female/male workers negotiate about their wages in a different way and do male/female managers negotiate differently? 2) Do negotiation outcomes (wages) differ between a setting where the gender of the other side is known as compared to when it is not? 3) Do negotiation outcomes (wages) differ between mixed and same gender pairs when gender is known? 4) Do managers behave differently when they negotiate with workers of same versus different gender?",step2,True
Gender pay-gap and fairness: A vignette experiment in Italy,"Despite progress in developed nations, gender inequality remains prevalent, particularly in the labour market, including employment rates, unemployment, and wages (Kiessling et al., 2019; Pelham, Hetts, 2001; Hogue et al., 2007). According to Hazel and Kleyman (2020), various factors contribute to this gap, including the ""motherhood penalty"" (Budig, Hodges, 2010; Hartmann et al., 2016), occupational segregation (Hegewisch et al., 2010), compensation negotiation (Mazei et al., 2015), entitlement (O’Brien et al., 2012), the ""glass ceiling"" (Catalyst, 2018), the ""glass cliff"" (Mulcahy &amp; Linehan, 2014), bias or discrimination in job advertisements and hiring (Gaucher et al., 2011), performance evaluations (Koch et al., 2015), workplace harassment, and leadership stereotyping (Catalyst, 2005; Eagly, Karau, 2002).
Italy scores rather low on the gender equality index with 63.8 points compared to the European Union (EU) average of 68.0 (EIGE, 2021). Although Italy’s gender pay gap stands at 4.2%, much lower than the EU average of 13% , it still lags behind many OECD countries in female and youth employment rates . Indeed, in 2023, the Bank of Italy reported that “the difference between the employment rate of men and women was 18.1 percentage points in Italy, the second largest in the European Union and appears to be mostly driven by the lower participation of women in the labour market: Italy indeed shows the lowest female activity rate in the EU (56.4 and 69.5 per cent, respectively in 2022), while gender differences in unemployment rates — although larger than the European average — are more limited (2.3 percentage points, compared with 0.6 points in the EU)” (Carta et al., 2023: 8). 
In such context, it is essential to quantify people’s perceptions of fair wages for men and women. Several studies have examined gender differences in perceptions of earnings fairness (Adriaans et al., 2022; Brüggemann, Hinz, 2023; Cohn et al., 20215; Pfeifer, Gesine, 2019; Schildberg-Hörisch et al., 2023; Wysieńska-Di Carlo, Karpiński, 2024) and the factors influencing this gap. Others have explored pay disparities across occupational sectors and the role of gender bias in recruitment (Carlsson et al., 2021; Schwarz, Copoock, 2022). Furthermore, recent research has highlighted the influence of fields of study and hobbies in perpetuating the gender pay gap (Galos, Kulic, 2022; Galos, 2024; Gemar, 2020). However, much of this research has not focused on Italy.
This experiment seeks to explore perceptions of fair wages and candidate suitability based on different characteristics, including gender, age, ethnicity, parental status, field of study, occupation, and hobbies. Specifically, the objectives are to:
•	Examine perceptions of fair wages based on gender (women versus men).
•	Assess candidate suitability for specific positions based on gender in combination with age, ethnicity, parental status, field of study, occupations, and hobbies.
•	Explore how perceptions of fairness and suitability in proposed scenarios vary according to survey respondents' characteristics.
This experiment is significant for three reasons. First, as it is difficult to disentangle the reasons for gender pay gap with observational data, and particularly to study bias, the experimental approach offers a better understanding of the possible patterns of bias. Second, it focuses on Italy, offering a novel case study in the literature. Finally, it investigates how different characteristics (i.e., age, ethnicity, parental status, field of study, occupation, and hobbies) interact with gender influencing salary evaluation and job suitability of men and women.

Understanding employees' informal workplace learning,"
               Purpose
                – This paper aims to investigate the joint influence of employees' career motivation and their self-construal on their engagement in three informal workplace learning activities: keeping up-to-date, asking for feedback from supervisors and knowledge sharing. 
            
            
               Design/methodology/approach
                – Data were collected through an online questionnaire from 323 employees from four Dutch Vocational Education and Training (VET) schools. Regression analyses were used to test the hypothesis. 
            
            
               Findings
                – Career motivation is positively related to all three informal learning activities. Employees' individual self-construal strengthens the relationship between career motivation and engagement in the learning activity of keeping up-to-date, while employees' collective self-construal strengthens the relationship between career motivation and engagement in the learning activity of knowledge sharing. Contrary to expectations, employees' relational self-construal does not strengthen the relationship between career motivation and engagement in the learning activity of feedback asking from supervisors. 
            
            
               Research limitations/implications
                – The use of cross-sectional data collection made this study vulnerable to common method bias. Future studies should consider using a longitudinal research approach to overcome this limitation. 
            
            
               Practical implications
                – The findings suggest that both the motivational issue of “what do you want” and the self-identity issue of “who you are” are important for employee informal workplace learning. For human resource (HR) professionals this suggests that they should stimulate employees' career motivation, while for employees this suggests that they should engage in informal learning activities in keeping with their own style. 
            
            
               Originality/value
                – This is one of the first studies to provide empirical support for the joint influence of career motivation and self-construal on employees' informal workplace learning.

The Effect of Eviction on Maternal Criminal Justice Involvement," Millions of individuals in the United States experience eviction each year, with low-income women being particularly at risk. As a result, scholarship has increasingly sought to understand what the implications of eviction are for families. In this article, we build on this work by presenting the first estimates of the impact of eviction on criminal justice involvement for mothers in the U.S. context and examining three pathways that may help to explain these associations. Using longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, adjusted estimates suggest that mothers who have been evicted have more than two times higher odds of experiencing criminal justice involvement. When we differentiate by eviction timing, we find that both recent and less recent evictions are associated with criminal justice involvement. Last, we find that eviction indirectly affects criminal justice involvement through future financial hardship and substance use. ",step2,True
Formal Challenges of Criminal Liability of Legal Persons in Iran's Criminal Justice System,"In this discussion, we aim to address the topic of the formal challenges of criminal liability of legal persons in Iran's criminal justice system and the procedural issues associated with it. One of the innovations of the Islamic Penal Code ratified in 2013 is the recognition of criminal liability for legal persons. The significance and special status of legal persons in contemporary society compelled the legislator to establish this important institution in criminal law by dedicating several articles to it. Criminal liability of legal persons has not been discussed in Islamic jurisprudence. This research examines the criminal liability of legal persons in Iran's criminal justice system. The foundations of criminal liability of legal persons differ between jurisprudence and law, although there are similarities in the reasoning process; however, the methods of proof vary. The basis of the criminal liability of legal persons is vicarious liability. Legal persons may attempt to conceal their assets to evade the enforcement of criminal judgments. Additionally, corruption and collusion can influence judicial and enforcement procedures, thereby harming justice and trust in the judicial system. Delays in various stages of the judicial process, such as issuing judgments later than expected and delays in executing enforcement actions, can also reduce confidence in justice. Insufficient coordination and cooperation between judicial, enforcement, and law enforcement institutions can present obstacles to enforcing criminal judgments against legal persons. These challenges highlight the necessity of reforms and changes in Iran's judicial and criminal enforcement systems to improve procedural efficiency and enhance justice when dealing with legal persons who bear criminal liability. The research methodology is analytical and descriptive. The findings of this study emphasize reforming the perpetrator and facilitating fair trial proceedings, ensuring that the harm inflicted on victims is adequately compensated. Given the resources available to legal persons, they are in a better position than natural persons to compensate the victims of crimes. Punishing legal persons upholds the principle of equality before the law and the principle of the individuality of punishments, thereby promoting justice and fairness.

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Work Requirements and Safety-Net Program Participation,"ImportanceWork requirements are a controversial feature of US safety-net programs, with some policymakers seeking to expand their use. Little is known about the demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic characteristics of individuals most likely to be negatively impacted by work requirements.ObjectiveTo examine the association between work requirements and safety-net program enrollment.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis cohort study included Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) enrollees in Connecticut. The impact of SNAP work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents—the target population—was estimated using a triple-differences research design comparing outcomes before and after the policy (first difference) in affected and exempted towns (second difference) between the targeted population and untargeted parents and caregivers (third difference). SNAP and Medicaid enrollment trends were assessed for a 24-month period, and the characteristics of individuals most likely to lose coverage were examined. Data were collected from August 2015 to April 2018, and data were analyzed from August 2022 to September 2024.ExposuresThe reintroduction of SNAP work requirements in 2016.Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of enrollees disenrolled from SNAP and Medicaid.ResultsOf 81 888 Medicaid enrollees in Connecticut, 46 872 (57.2%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 36.6 (7.0) years. Of these, 38 344 were able-bodied adults without dependents, of which 19 172 were exposed to SNAP work requirements, and 43 544 were parents or caregivers exempted from SNAP work requirements. SNAP coverage declined 5.9 percentage points (95% CI, 5.1-6.7), or 25%, following work requirements. There were no statistically significant changes in Medicaid coverage (0.2 percentage points; 95% CI, −1.4 to 1.0). Work requirements disproportionately affected individuals with more chronic illnesses, targeted beneficiaries who were older, and beneficiaries with lower incomes. Individuals with diabetes were 5 percentage points (95% CI, 0.8-9.3), or 91%, likelier to lose SNAP coverage than those with no chronic conditions; older SNAP beneficiaries (aged 40 to 49 years) with multiple comorbidities were 7.3 percentage points (95% CI, 4.3-11.3), or 553%, likelier to disenroll than younger beneficiaries (aged 25 to 29 years) without chronic conditions; and households with the lowest incomes were 18.6 percentage points (95% CI, 11.8-25.4), or 204%, likelier to lose coverage than the highest income SNAP beneficiaries.Conclusions and RelevanceIn this cohort study, SNAP work requirements led to substantial reductions in SNAP coverage, especially for the most clinically and socioeconomically vulnerable. Work requirements had little effect on Medicaid coverage, suggesting they did not lead to sufficient increases in employment to transition beneficiaries off the broader safety net.",step2,True
Rural versus Urban Areas and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,"AbstractThis study quantifies how spending changes induced by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) affects production and employment in rural and urban areas. A general equilibrium simulation model with an estimated demand system is first used to project how SNAP affects spending on different goods and services. These impacts are then linked to the expansion and contraction of different economic sectors that differ in importance across rural and urban Oregon. In urban areas, a number of service sectors linked to higher-income households shrink slightly in response to SNAP, while food-related sectors expand; the net effect on jobs is slightly negative. Production changes in rural areas are generally smaller, while having a slightly positive net effect on jobs. Overall, SNAP makes a positive difference for low- or no-income households without strong effects elsewhere in the economy.",step2,True
There was no golden age: social mobility into cultural and creative occupations,"Cultural and creative industries are currently narrated as one of the greatest forces for openness and social mobility that Britain has (Hancock 2016). However, there is little, if any, evidence to support this position. Recent research has suggested the creative and cultural occupations are dominated by those from professional or managerial backgrounds (O’Brien et al 2016, Oakley et al 2017), with cultural theorists arguing this reflects declining rates of social mobility over time (Banks 2017). This paper provides the first empirical assessment of claims made by policy and cultural theory concerning changing patterns of social mobility into cultural and creative occupations. We use the England and Wales Longitudinal Study, along with three birth cohort studies, to offer the first analysis of social mobility into cultural and creative occupations over time. We demonstrate that: cultural and creative occupations have always been characterised by overrepresentations of those from privileged social origins, with little evidence of a classless meritocracy; rates of absolute social mobility are declining in these occupations, contradicting policymakers’ faith in a ‘meritocracy’ for talented individuals aiming to work in artistic and cultural jobs; this decline in absolute levels of social mobility is in contrast to the stability in relative social mobility, indicating there was no ‘golden age’ for social mobility into cultural occupations. These three points illustrate the importance of occupational perspectives on cultural and creative industries and the value of sociological analysis for public policy questions in this area. In particular, the lack of social fluidity in the occupations producing culture is a key issue for future public policy intervention. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research on longevity of cultural careers and the importance of gender using the Longitudinal Study dataset.",step2,True
Risk and Protective factors of Polydrug Overdose in North Carolina,"Despite intensive prevention efforts from federal and state agencies, drug overdose deaths have been increasing steadily over the past two decades. Overdoses claimed &gt; 93,000 lives in 2020 alone, and more than 100,000 deaths during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.1,2 Drug overdose rates are even higher among vulnerable populations such as formerly incarcerated individuals, who experienced 20 times higher fentanyl overdose mortality than the general population during 2016-2019 in North Carolina (NC). Further, in NC, &gt;70% of overdoses involve multiple drugs (polydrug), especially illicit fentanyl mixed with prescription opioids, cocaine, benzodiazepines, and stimulants.3 Polydrug overdoses are increasingly fatal, both because of high potency of the drugs and because naloxone is less effective for polydrug overdoses. Polydrug overdoses are also increasing disproportionately among racial/ethnic minority Americans.4-7 From 2007-2019, cocaine and opioid combined overdose rates increased by 575% among Blacks compared to 184% among Whites.6
These changing trends from single to polydrug overdose deaths are evident nationwide. However, entities with the potential to implement large prevention initiatives – health systems, insurers, and departments of corrections – lack the linked data to establish benchmarks of polydrug overdose incidence in their populations and define risk and protective factors. Many people who die from polydrug overdose have had contact with health care, health insurance, or correctional system, representing critical missed opportunities for prevention.  Further, growing research, including by our team, suggests that rapid dose reduction in prescription opioids among those receiving long-term high-dose opioids increases the risk of opioid overdose,8,9 10,11 possibly by leading to substitution with illicit opioids,12,13 but the relationship of long-term prescription opioid management decisions with polydrug overdoses remains undefined. Finally, despite the power of “big data” approaches, certain questions key to prevention efforts can only be examined through complementary qualitative primary data collection with people with lived experience and treatment providers, such as the pathways to polydrug use and the role of prescription opioids as an on-ramp to polydrug use.14
To address these key needs, our objective in this proposal is to define polydrug overdose rates and trends in four large populations representing publicly and privately insured individuals, health system patients, and formerly incarcerated individuals; identify short- and long-term risk and protective factors for polydrug overdose in each population; assess the relationship between long-term prescription opioid management decisions and risk of polydrug overdose; and elucidate pathways to polydrug use from the user and treatment provider perspectives. We will accomplish this objective by linking 16 years of statewide mortality and cause-of-death data with large administrative datasets from the state Medicaid program, a large private insurer, a large statewide health care system, and the state Department of Corrections, as we have successfully done in prior projects, combined with complementary primary qualitative data collection from users and providers. Our team is well positioned to address these needs through our deep research expertise in overdose, 11,15-18 acute and chronic pain,17,19-22 mental health,23,24 health care utilization,20-22 and qualitative methods;16,24,25  our extensive experience in applying rigorous epidemiological methods to large, linked databases; our established access to the proposed databases; and our successful work in three prior federally funded projects26-28 to link all of these databases using all necessary safeguards and security measures.",step2,True
THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF MILITARY SERVICE: EVIDENCE FROM THE VIETNAM DRAFT," There is a strong cross‐sectional association between military service and adverse health. However, veterans differ very significantly in their observable characteristics from nonveterans, suggesting that some of the association between military service and adverse health may be due to omitted variables bias. To address this problem, we use draft eligibility as an instrument for military service. Despite a very strong first‐stage relationship between draft eligibility and military service, the two‐stage least squares estimates of the difference in health between veterans and nonveterans are statistically insignificant and too imprecise to preclude the differences in health found in the cross‐sectional regressions.

"Salience, Food Security, and SNAP Receipt","AbstractHousehold food insecurity status in the United States is ascertained by a battery of close‐ended questions. We posit that the monthly nature of benefit receipt from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) creates experiences of food hardship, which become salient in the context of SNAP receipt, and in turn exert influence on the response to food security questions. We test this hypothesis by examining answers to a 30‐day food security module in relation to when SNAP benefits are received. We find that for SNAP households near the end of or at the beginning of the benefit month, the probability of being classified as food insecure increases by 11 percentage points, over a baseline of 42 percent. We also find that the probability of responding affirmatively to any of the first five items in the module increases during this time. We discuss the importance of these findings for the estimation of food security and its implication on program evaluation.",step2,True
Socioeconomic and demographic aspects related to food and nutrition (in)security of Brazilians during the COVID-19 pandemic: A scoping review.,"P (participants), C (concept), C (context):
P - Brazilian population
C - SAN
C - COVID

Objective:
The main objective of this scoping review is to identify the socioeconomic and demographic contexts related to food (in)security of Brazilian families during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction:
The emergence of COVID-19 in Brazil highlighted the discrepancy between the different social realities coexisting in the same country, and rekindled discussions on food and nutrition security, in the same way, that it has been happening in other nations. Knowing the factors that aggravated the SAN/IAN scenario in Brazil during the pandemic moment is an important starting point for making strategic decisions that help to mitigate these effects on the quality of food for individuals. Because of this, checking the available evidence is essential to understand what has already been studied and to identify knowledge gaps that are still poorly addressed in this new scenario.

Inclusion criteria:
The review will focus on studies developed in Brazil to investigate food and nutrition (in)security since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Only studies carried out for the Brazilian population will be considered. This review will include quantitative studies and those that mix the quantitative method with the qualitative one. Qualitative studies, articles on the validation of questionnaires to investigate AI and others forms of articles will be excluded, like, essays, opinions, and commentary.

Methods:
The bibliographic search will be carried out in the BVS, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, using the search descriptors in English (MeSH Terms): ""food supply""; OR ""food insecurity""; OR ""food security"" (title), OR ""segurança alimentar"" OR “insegurança alimentar”; OR “seguridad alimentaria”; AND ""COVID"" OR, “coronavirus” OR, “pandemics”; AND ""Brazil"". The data will be taken from the materials selected according to the inclusion criteria, by independent reviewers, and will be presented in tables, as well as in text format through a narrative construction.

INTRODUCTION:
Food and Nutrition Security (SAN) is defined as the realization of the human right to adequate food (DHAA) for all citizens, with access to food regularly and healthily, so that the guarantee of this right does not impact other essential needs, respects food culture and diversity and is sustainable from an environmental, economic, and social point of view, and is recognized in Brazil through Law 11.345/2006.
By contrast, Food and Nutrition Insecurity (IAN), is considered both in situations of insufficient food, as in the presence of hunger and malnutrition, and also in situations of aggravations arising from an inadequate diet, such as for overweight and nutritional deficiencies. specific. The consequences of these situations fall on different sectors, more directly health and economics.
During the pandemic, the SAN/IAN scenario in Brazil has changed, and today, more than half of Brazilian households, 59.4%, are in a situation of FIN, according to a study carried out by researchers at the “Food for Justice” group at the Free University of Berlin, together with the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) and the University of Brasília (UnB).
Food and Nutrition Insecurity directly impacts the health of individuals, for example, increasing the immunological vulnerability of the human organism, harming physical and mental development, and increasing the chances of developing diseases, which makes the most vulnerable portions of the population even most exposed to COVID-19. It is known that food and nutrition security has been affected by the social and economic impacts of COVID-19, especially when considering situations of social, income, ethnic-racial, gender inequality, and access to health services.
Recently, Brazil has suffered from the effects of the spread of the Ômicron variant, which seems to be increased by a synergistic effect with an influenza epidemic caused by the H3N2 variant in the country. The advance of a new wave has caused a series of dismissals of employees from the various economic sectors and increased concern about the impacts that the pandemic will continue to produce over another year on the living conditions of Brazilians.
The current scenario of uncertainties reinforces the need to know the aspects that contribute to the perception of food and nutritional insecurity among the population in general, such as the change in household income, changes in the work routine, among other factors that can contribute to increased social, economic and food vulnerability of these individuals.

REVIEW QUESTIONS
What are the sociodemographic and economic aspects that influence FNS during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil?

This main question can be subdivided into other propositions:
What kind of evidence and/or study designs verify the relationship between the COVID 19 pandemic and food and nutrition (in)security?
What types of variables make up the studies that point to the increase in IAN during the pandemic moment?
What knowledge gaps do these studies still present?

INCLUSION CRITERIA

Participants
Studies carried out with the Brazilian population using the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale (EBIA) from the first case of COVID 19 in the country until the present moment will be analyzed. This involves studies that used the full version or adaptations of the EBIA, excluding those that, perhaps, sought to carry out validations of the scale during this period.

Concept
The initial concept of this study is to assess how the Brazilian population perceives food and nutrition (in)security during the pandemic caused by the new coronavirus. The pandemic directly affects food supply and demand, reducing purchasing power, as well as the ability to produce and distribute food, which causes greater problems for the most vulnerable parts of the population (ALPINO et al, 2020). The national scientific literature points to an increase in food and nutritional insecurity from 2016, after a long period of promotion of social assistance policies, such as Bolsa Família, for example. According to Santos et al. (2018), the prevalence of food safety increased by 19% between 2004 and 2013, from 64.8% to 77.1%. In the context of the pandemic, the Brazilian Research Network on Food and Nutrition Sovereignty and Security (PENSSAN Network), carried out the National Survey on Food Insecurity in the Context of the Covid-19 Pandemic in Brazil, which found that 55.2% of the population was some degree of food insecurity, of which 9% lived with hunger. Due to the changes that the pandemic scenario brings to the reality of the Brazilian population, this review aims to know the variables that make up the perception of Brazilians about SAN/IAN, to characterize theoretical models that help in the construction of statistical analyzes more robust.

Context
The review will be limited to the search for scientific productions that bring evidence only from the Brazilian population since it is understood that the characteristics that define the SAN/IAN differ among the different populations. Therefore, this includes publications made in national and international journals, which bring within their scope the use of the EBIA, regardless of its version - full or short, specifically in the Brazilian population and have statistical analyzes that dialogue with socioeconomic and demographic variables, excluding, therefore, the review studies, and considering qualitative and quantitative studies, in addition to those that mix the quantitative/qualitative approach. Studies that do not consider SAN/IAN as the main outcome will also not be considered.

METHOD
This scoping review will be conducted following the JBI methodology.

Selection of studies
Following the pre-established search and selection protocols, all studies to be considered will be organized on the Zotero platform and those that may be duplicates will be excluded. Titles and abstracts will be evaluated by independent reviewers for proper comparisons regarding the agreement with the inclusion criteria. The full texts will be evaluated in detail by the reviewers and again analyzed according to the inclusion criteria. The reasons for the exclusion of studies will be reported in the content of the scoping review. Any disagreements between evaluators will be discussed in a group for consensus decision-making. The results will be extracted and discussed throughout the study and will be consolidated according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) in a diagram.

Data extraction
Information of interest will be extracted from publications by independent reviewers, following the inclusion protocols, aligned with the objectives of this scope review proposal and the guidelines stipulated by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI).

Data presentation
Data from the included studies will be presented in tables and as a descriptive summary. Tables will illustrate the central concepts arising from the included studies, which will be described in detail in the descriptive summary.",step2,True
"Nutrition, obesity and unhealthy food relationships in food insecure populations: systems modelling of health-related policies and outcomes (NOURISH).","Obesity and food insecurity are rising in the UK, and policy makers need to identify evidence-based strategies to reduce these. Both are strongly related to environmental factors influencing food access and availability. Policies that alter the food environment may reduce obesity, but they may have unintended consequences including differential effects on food secure versus insecure populations. Agent-based models (ABMs) are a promising tool for evaluating public health policies, considering the complexity of behaviour and individual-environment interactions. However, their application to dietary policy has been limited. 

Aim: To assess the health, economic and inequality impact of food environment policies across localities using a categories of food insecurity lens. 

Research questions: 
RQ1: What conceptual model describes how food insecurity, alongside other factors within the food system, influences the impact of food environment policies on high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) food consumption and obesity?
RQ2. How can a combination of datasets inform the estimation of structural equation models and a synthetic population to examine how differential exposure to environment factors including deprivation affect household food insecurity and hence influence different food choices for individuals, households and communities? 
RQ3: What is the structure and parameter estimation for an agent-based model that incorporates how environment and food insecurity factors influence individuals’ food choices so that the model is calibrated to the emergent, contrasting trends between 2018 and 2023 in HFSS consumption by food insecurity categories and obesity rates for population subgroups across local authorities in Greater Manchester?  
RQ4: What are the impacts of three food environment policies (advertising, outlet restrictions, accessibility of healthy food) on health outcomes, labour market outcomes and inequalities for population subgroups across Greater Manchester localities including those defined by food insecurity category?

Methods: 
The study takes a multidisciplinary approach involving stakeholder engagement, conceptual modelling, data synthesis, structural equation modelling, and empirical ABM development including comprehensive model calibration and validation. We will integrate data from surveys and environmental databases to create a synthetic population. The ABM will be calibrated and validated using trends in obesity and HFSS consumption for 10 local authorities across Greater Manchester. We will use the ABM to simulate three dietary policies and quantify the impact on HFSS consumption, obesity, and health and economic costs and benefits. 

Timelines for delivery. 
The project has four work packages across a 36-month period. We will specify model structure and perform data integration in the first year of the project. The second year of the project will build and validate the ABM. The final year of the project will perform health economic analysis for three food environment policies. 

Anticipated impact and dissemination. 
We will publish 7 open-access publications across health, nutrition and modelling journals. We will present at key obesity and public health conferences. Our work will build a robust framework for UK-focused ABMs of food policies with a food insecurity lens. We will develop policy briefing documents with stakeholders and public representatives to communicate key findings.",step2,True
Family Stories about Parents as Resources for Young Adults’ Well-Being and Identity,"We are surrounded by life stories throughout life. This includes stories about our family members and other important people as we are growing up. Family stories include smaller, daily events—the kinds of stories shared over meals—as well as stories about larger milestones or events (e.g., how parents met, birth of a loved one) and stories about the deeper family genealogy (e.g., stories about how descendants first immigrated to the United States). Just like the ways we have access to autobiographical life stories and organize these stories can be important for well-being and a clear understanding of our identity, the stories we carry about others—our vicarious stories—could be important for these areas of functioning. We tested college adults’ access to stories about their parents, focusing on stories about events their parents were proud of growing up. We asked whether college adults might differ in having ready access to stories about parents, why stories about parents were first shared with these adults, and how coherent the memories about parents were rated by storytellers. We were also interested in how these stories might be related to well-being and identity progress. We expected having access to stories, having stories that were shared for certain functions (i.e., life lessons), and having stories that were viewed as more coherent would be related to greater well-being and identity development. We studied two groups of college adults: adults working remotely during COVID-19-related shutdowns (i.e., Fall 2020); and adults working in-person around colleges (i.e., Spring 2022). Most adults had ready access to stories about parent stories, and many stories involved life lessons or ways of better understanding parents’ upbringings. Parent story coherence was positively related with aspects of well-being and identity commitment, reinforcing the widespread relevance and importance of family stories. ",step2,True
Housing Choice Voucher Holders and Neighborhood Crime," It is often alleged that households moving into neighborhoods with the aid of housing choice vouchers (HCVs) raise crime rates there. We use 1999–2008 quarterly data from Chicago census tracts to test this allegation with a dynamic panel model designed to overcome the challenges of omitted variable and endogeneity biases. We find no support for the proposition that growth in HCV holders leads to growth in violent crime rates, regardless of neighborhood context. We find that growth in HCV holders is positively associated with growth in property crime rates, however, in higher poverty neighborhoods or if HCVs exceed a threshold concentration. ",step2,True
Reducing Anti-Immigrant Sentiment and Promoting Pro-Immigrant Behavior in Host Latin American Countries,"The world faces a humanitarian crisis, partly driven by the thousands of undocumented migrants from Latin America and the Caribbean trying to reach the United States. For human rights advocates, one of the most pressing challenges in addressing this crisis is how to improve citizens’ attitudes toward immigrants. While a growing scientific consensus indicates that hearing about the experiences of outgroup members reduces intergroup bias, we still know little about which specific narratives can durably reduce anti-migrant sentiment and promote pro-immigrant behavior. Drawing on multiple theoretical traditions from social psychology and political science, we fill this gap by examining the policy, prejudice-reduction, and altruistic consequences of four types of personal narratives that (1) challenge the association between migrants and criminals, (2) highlight shared life aspirations between natives and migrants, (3) depict migrants as hardworking, and (4) highlight the solidarity of fellow native citizens. We test the implications of empathy-based audiovisual media campaigns by focusing on Mexico, a country that has repeatedly responded to the humanitarian crisis at the border with repressive tactics, including militarization and use of force, apprehensions in detention facilities, the separation of children from their parents, and massive deportation of refugees. Our research program relies on a mixed method approach, combining extensive fieldwork research with a series of survey experiments embedded in large-scale online surveys that oversample respondents in high migration states in the northern and southern borders of Mexico. This pre-analysis plan (PAP) contains the description of our experimental design, power analysis, and the ways we anticipate analyzing the data. We will conduct a three-wave panel study with approximately 8,000  individuals taking the baseline survey. We anticipate publishing at least three studies using data from the three-wave panel.",step2,True

Policy influences on early care and education arrangements,"In this study, we compare early care and education arrangements from 2012 to 2019 using two waves of the National Survey of Early Care and Education. While awareness of the importance of early education has been growing over the last two decades, concerns about affordability, quality, and access, especially for children from economically-disadvantaged families and English language learners, continue to challenge policy makers at the federal, state, and local levels. We take advantage of the release of the 2019 data to examine the consequences of two main policy or programmatic changes that have occurred between 2012 to 2019. 
 One policy is the reauthorization of the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) in 2014. CCDF provides federal money to states and territories to subsidize the cost of childcare for low-income families. The new law made significant changes to eligibility requirements and redetermination criteria for childcare subsidies, making it likely that more families might be eligible and participate. Three aspects of the new law will be examined: higher-income eligibility thresholds, longer recertification periods, and fewer barriers for Hispanic and non-native English speakers. Because some states were already implementing some of these policies, the new law creates state variation of policy implementation between 2012 and 2019. Our work extends recent descriptive and correlational literature on the 2014 CCDF law by leveraging the longitudinal nature of the data and using quasi-experimental techniques. The main questions to be answered are (1) What effects these changes have made to the characteristics of children enrolled in various early care and education settings and (2) Is there evidence of  differential impact among children from the lowest-income families or those residing in high-poverty communities and/or areas with higher percentages of Hispanic children?   
The second policy of interest is the decision at the state or local level to increase the availability of prekindergarten (pre-k) classes in public school settings. Prekindergartens located in public school settings are often free or heavily subsidized and research suggests pre-k located in public schools may be more effective than home- or center-based programs at enhancing school readiness. Yet a lack of flexibility in scheduled hours may limit their attractiveness to some parents and the growth of this free or low-cost early care option may ultimately reduce the number of care slots available in other settings. We specifically seek to answer the following questions: (1) How do the characteristics of preschool-aged children differ across early care and education settings as the availability of pre-k slots in public schools varies over time and within states? (2)  Is there evidence of differential impact among children from the lowest-income families or those residing in high-poverty communities and/or areas with higher percentages of Hispanic children? For both inquiries, our focus is on children not yet in kindergarten.   
 To answer our research questions, we first document and compare the characteristics of young children attending various early care and education settings for both the 2012 and 2019 cohorts. We then will use regression analyses including multinomial probit equations, difference-in-difference analyses and Oaxaca decompositions to better understand the factors predicting the family’s choice of main care setting. Investigations will allow us to test whether the two policy changes had effects on the decision to enroll in home-, center-, and Head Start settings in particular. Answers to these questions will assist the Administration for Children and Families and also the Office of Head Start in learning more about changes in the early care environment over time especially for economically-disadvantaged and English learning children.",step2,True
Labor Market Returns to Noncredit CTE Programs in Virginia Community Colleges,"Building on a long standing partnership with the entire Virginia Community College System (VCCS) of 23 institutions, this project aims to estimate employment and wage returns of the noncredit CTE programs offered by these schools.  Noncredit CTE programs, called ""FastForward"" programs in Virginia, were expanded in the community college system in 2016.  We will use data from all enrollees in the FastForward program since 2016 alongside VCCS credit-bearing data, National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) data, and Virginia Unemployment Insurance (UI) wage records to reports the labor market returns to the FastForward programs.",step2,True
Domestic Creditors and Sovereign Debt Repayment,"A growing share of emerging market sovereign debt is held, by choice or government pressure, by domestic institutional investors and individuals. Our study examines the implications of this development for how we understand the politics of sovereign debt repayment. We examine two implications of this development. First, we test if citizens have a preference for repaying debt held by domestic creditors. Second, we examine the implication that domestic debt provides a clearly identified constituency for repayment consistent with distributive arguments of the ``democratic advantage'' in sovereign borrowing. We test if such material interests influence preferences for debt repayments with a survey experiment fielded in Brazil in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic. Our study has clear implications for research on the ``democratic advantage.'' However, it also holds implications for debates over the role of material interests in sovereign debt politics and international political economy more broadly.",step2,True
Impact of unconditional cash transfers on background and oscillatory brain activity in infancy and early childhood,"Growing up in families with lower economic resources has been associated with children's brain function. Evidence suggests that early brain function may be sensitive to economic aid interventions. Previous research from the Baby First Years project (BFY) suggests that, in households with incomes below the federal poverty line, receiving a larger unconditional cash gift ($333 monthly) may have impacts on brain activity in infancy and early childhood when compared to peers who received a more nominal cash gift ($20 monthly). This has been measured with electroencephalography (EEG) during baseline/resting state protocols employing absolute/relative power to characterize brain function (see ""Other"" section of this preregister for more information about these results). One limitation of standard power measures is that they conflate two separable sources of brain activity (aperiodic and oscillatory) that have their own biological origins. As such, current BFY findings may be driven by variations in either background or oscillatory activity. This study aims to add additional understanding to already observed impacts in brain activity by re-analyzing BFY data to separate aperiodic and oscillatory brain activity when children were 12 months and 4 years old. Based on the preprocessed data sets already published, we will parameterize the EEG power spectrum employing “specparam” toolbox to delineate group differences in aperiodic and oscillatory activity between high-cash income and low-cash gift groups.",step2,True
"Unraveling Firms: Demand, Productivity and Markups Heterogeneity","Abstract
               We develop a novel framework that simultaneously allows recovering heterogeneity in demand, quantity total factor productivity and markups across firms while leaving the correlation between the three dimensions unrestricted. We accomplish this by explicitly introducing demand heterogeneity and systematically exploiting assumptions used in previous productivity estimation approaches. In doing so, we provide an exact decomposition of revenue productivity in terms of the underlying heterogeneities, thus bridging the gap between quantity and revenue productivity estimations. We use Belgian firms’ production data to quantify total factor productivity, demand and markups, and show how they are correlated with each other across time and with measures obtained from other approaches. In doing so, we find quantity total factor productivity and demand to be strongly negatively correlated with each other, so suggesting a trade-off between the quality of a firm’s products and their production cost. We also show how our framework provides deeper and sharper insights on the response of firms to increasing import competition from China.

The Consequences of Incarceration for Mortality in the United States,"Previous research suggests that incarceration has negative implications for individuals’ well-being, health, and mortality. Most of these studies, though, do not follow former prisoners over extended periods of time and into older adult ages when it is more likely that cumulative consequences of incarceration will be felt. This paper contributes to this literature by employing for the first time the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to estimate the long-run association between individual incarceration and mortality over nearly 40 years, and supplementing those analyses with the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79). We then use these estimates to investigate the implications of the US incarceration regime and the post-1980 incarceration boom for the US health and mortality disadvantage relative to industrialized peer countries (the United Kingdom).",step2,True
Access to Credit for Minority-owned Businesses,"Equal access to small business credit is a critical underpinning to equity in economic opportunity; however, it is difficult to regularly assess the fairness of credit provision. Prior research has focused on the Federal Reserve Board’s Survey of Small Business Finance, but last data from this source covered 2003. This article provides preliminary results on new credit access question added to the Census Bureau’s 2021 Annual Business Survey. We find that minority-owned businesses were just as likely to apply for credit in 2020, but Black-, Asian-, and Hispanic-owned businesses were less likely than white-owned businesses to report receiving all of the credit that they sought. Black-, Asian-, and Hispanic-owned firms also more frequently reported that the credit was intended for meeting operating expenses and that their ongoing viability was weaker heading into 2022.",step2,True
