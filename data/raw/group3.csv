2,"evicted america: national study of eviction prevalence, causes, and consequences",Baruch,2019,2022.0,Ashley Gromis,"We study the prevalence, causes, and consequences of eviction in the United States. We will use the 2017 American Housing Survey, which contains measures of informal as well as formal eviction, and the 2018 Rental Housing Finance Survey, when it becomes available. We will first produce national and regional estimates of the prevalence of types of evictions, comparing the frequency of formal and informal eviction. Next, we will document the causes of eviction, focusing on the importance of demographic and socioeconomic factors, including family type, gender, and income level. To inform policy and programmatic responses, we will then analyze the consequences of eviction on housing search, housing quality, and neighborhood quality.

3,an evaluation of the impact of the social security disability insurance program on labor force participation during the 1990s,Chicago,2007,2007.0,Susan E Chen,"This study will evaluate the impact of the Social Security Disability Insurance program (SSDI) on the labor force behavior of men. I will use two main approaches. First, I will follow Bound (1989) using a more current dataset, with more complete information on rejected SSDI applicants. This technique will produce a more precise upper bound on the elasticity of SSDI participation. Second, in addition to providing an upper bound, I will adopt a quasi-experimental approach to provide a point estimate of the impact for an important sub-sample of applicants: those whose eligibility is based in part on vocational factors. More specifically, with data on rejected as well as accepted SSDI applicants, I will be able to exploit the idiosyncrasies of the Social Security Administration’s Disability Determination Process. I will be able to show that the SSDI participation rule fits within a quasi-experimental design framework that has recently gained significant attention in the economics literature: the Regression Discontinuity Design. The data that will be used are the 1990-1996 panels of SIPP exact matched to the Social Security Disability Determination 831 file. Creation of this new dataset will enhance the reach of the SIPP data in three ways. First, by matching the SIPP to Social Security data, I will obtain a more accurate measure of SSDI participation than available in the SIPP. Second, I will be to study the accuracy of and relationships between self-reported SSDI benefit receipt, health measures and disability status in the SIPP.

7,hedonic models of real estate and labor markets,Chicago,2007,2012.0,Bhashkar Mazumder,"The proposed research program will develop and implement methods to estimate hedonic price supply and demand models applied to two important classes of empirical economic issues where hedonic models are applicable, real estate and labor markets. Since these models include attributes that are highly location specific, this project will also develop and implement methods to link the micro-observations of Census Bureau datasets to micro-observations of other Census Bureau datasets and to external datasets. This linkage will be based on locations of the micro-observations, i.e., their physical geospatial proximity with each other, and will be performed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). These two activities, development of hedonic prices and geospatial linking, form the principal benefits to the Census Bureau. In addition, through the application of these models to specific topics of interest, we will also generate bene-fits to specific Census Bureau surveys, such as the American Housing Survey and other surveys used through the course of the project. In order to apply hedonic models to study location issues, datasets containing highly detailed geographic information and robust methods for establishing the geospatial relationships are required. The project will use GIS modeling tools to create the necessary statistical measures of collocation that will enable us to examine specific topics using the hedonic approach. In addition, part of the proposed research will develop new methodological approaches that address some of the theoretical and empirical shortcomings with the classical hedonic model. The topics that will be studied in this project include: an analysis of residential real estate markets; an analysis of school quality, education, location, and neighborhood effects; commercial real estate markets and community economic development; and a hedonic analysis of labor markets.  This research program is focused not only on developing the data sources and tools needed to apply the hedonic approach to these questions but also on testing our progress with a series of interrelated topical studies that focus on some of these aspects. While the longer term goal is a more integrated assessment of the hedonic values across all of these factors, we begin with examining several more “manageable” sized research topics in this general area by incrementally developing the data and tools needed to measure the aforementioned community factors and estimate the hedonic prices associated with them.

22,california immigrant families and welfare reform,Berkeley,2002,2005.0,Henry E Brady,"This proposal is part of a larger study of the impact of welfare reform on California’s immigrant families. We propose to use the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and Current Population Survey (CPS) linked to two major statewide administrative data sets in California, the Medi-Cal Eligibility Data System (MEDS) of the California Department of Health Services and Unemployment Insurance/Disability Insurance (hereafter referred to as EDD data) of the California Employment Development Department. The linkage of these data sets will produce longitudinal files for the California sub-sample of the CPS and SIPP with detailed information on immigration status and household characteristics combined with administrative data on public assistance program participation and earnings over time. The proposed research will benefit the Census Bureau in a number of distinct ways. First, it will provide the Census Bureau with a basis to evaluate the accuracy of important self-reported measures in the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and the Current Population Survey (CPS), including Medicaid coverage, receipt of cash aid, Food Stamps, and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). This validation will be valuable for the future use of these surveys because SIPP and CPS tend to differ significantly in their estimates of participation in these important programs. Second, comparing the SIPP and CPS data on program participation with the MEDS records will allow us to investigate differences between self-reports and administrative records for the two same individuals due to characteristics of the surveys, such as reference time periods and question wording, which are linked to the inaccuracies of survey respondents’ self reports. Third, the match of EDD records with CPS and SIPP records will provide us with estimates of the direction and size of errors in reported earnings in the surveys. Fourth, this match will enable us to examine more closely the differences in poverty measures and rates using the CPS and SIPP by comparing the two surveys to administrative wage records and public assistance use. Fifth, using the administrative data we will evaluate the Survey of Population Dynamics (SPD) for its ability to track the use of welfare programs.

29,role mothers: intergenerational transmission of attitudes towards work,Chicago,2021,2024.0,Kelly G Strada,"What were the main drivers of female labor force participation during World War II? Were there long-term consequences for women who entered the workforce and for their children? In order to address these questions, I make use of the Census Numident File combined with the 1940 Census to construct a novel intercensal measure of labor force entry--SSN first issuance--for the wives of draft-eligible men. After linking these data to the WWII Enlistment Records, I exploit the draft lottery to construct an individual-level instrument for married women's workforce entry. In doing so, I can disentangle the supply and demand-side drivers of female labor supply during WWII--the former being proxied by government spending by town--conditional on a rich set of covariates. Furthermore, I plan to leverage the longitudinal structure of PIK-ed mandatory surveys to assess the long-term consequences of female entry. Specifically, by using reduced form evidence and instrumental variable techniques, I intend to assess whether being a working woman increased the likelihood of divorce and whether the outcomes of children of working mothers differed substantially from those of non-working mothers. In order to address identification concerns, I plan to extend the analysis to elicit random variation in the entry of female neighbors. Preliminary results suggest that a man's draft status (and timing) strongly predicts his wife's labor force entry: by accessing RDC data I wish to evaluate whether women paid a social cost for working and if their children benefited from having a working mother.",True,,,,https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcw037,https://openalex.org/W2481505561,2016.0,Oxford University Press,False,journal-article,Lucinda Platt,93.0,"Culture, Economy, and Development Studies",Social Sciences,2025-03-29T20:44:10.381744,0000-0002-8251-6400,London School of Economics,London,,GB,Step 2 Enriched Scraping + API,,,Step 2 Original_29

This project investigates measurement issues related to electronic commerce and produces estimates of the eﬀects of e-commerce on productivity. The project will also examine the impact of computer networks on business processes and on various elements of the supply chain. The study will examine the types of enterprises that use Electronic Commerce Technology (ECT), examine how ECT aﬀects e-supply chain and transforms production, deter-mine if and how the use of ECT results in value addition (or creation), and determine the adequacy of the measures used by the U.S. Census Bureau. The research will generate estimates of the eﬀect of e-commerce on productivity in manufacturing plants. The investigation will determine whether plants that invested in e-commerce technology received returns in the form of added productivity gains. The researchers’ investigation using Census Bureau data can lead to a detailed examination of whether the data are consistent with one of these hypotheses and identify sources of potential e-commerce measurement problems.

47,community variation in victim crime reporting: a multilevel analysis using data from the area-identified ncvs,Chicago,2001,2003.0,Eric P Baumer,"Although it has been well documented that a substantial portion of all crime experienced by citizens in the U.S. is not reported to the police, very few studies have systematically examined whether residents of certain types of communities are more, or less, likely to report crime victimizations to the police. This issue has not been addressed extensively largely because the data needed to do so—data on victims of crime and on the communities in which they reside—traditionally have not been available to researchers. If approved by the Census Bureau, the proposed research will use data from the 1995-2001 Area-Identified National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), linked with data from the Sample Survey of Law Enforcement Agencies (SSLEA), the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, and census data on tracts and places to investigate the effects of several characteristics of communities on the likelihood of police notification by crime victims. The community characteristics considered will include neighborhood features such as socioeconomic disadvantage, minority concentration, immigrant concentration, and residential instability, and place-level indicators such as the degree of local police involvement in community policing activities and the racial composition of the local police agency. The proposed research contributes significantly to the literature on victim crime reporting, and the analyses have important implications for macro-level research and theory tests which often assume little or no systematic variation in crime reporting across communities. In addition, the research will benefit the Census Bureau by adding contextual data to the NCVS, evaluating and improving the usefulness of the NCVS, using methodologies (e.g., survey regression techniques, multilevel modeling) that will enhance understanding of these data, and highlighting the value of the NCVS for cutting-edge theoretical and relevant research.",True,,,,https://doi.org/10.1086/449253,https://openalex.org/W2080643893,1997.0,University of Chicago Press,False,journal-article,Robert J.

While the implications of this “China Shock” for the U.S. manufacturing sector are well documented, little is known about how U.S. firms—the entities that own plants and employ workers—adjust to the China Shock. Do firms reallocate resources away from affected plants and toward plants in less affected industries? Or do they shift resources towards affected plants, allowing them to compete more effectively against Chinese imports? And what explains the direction and magnitude of the resource reallocation?

53,capital  adjustment and productivity patterns of plants and firms in the u.s. food and kindred products industry,Michigan,2003,2005.0,Pinar Celikkol Geylani,"Productivity advancement has been a major contributing factor to economic growth in the postwar U.S. economy and more accurate measurement of productivity and growth will assist future industry and government decision-making activities. The proposed research address some fundamental issues related to productivity and growth in the food-manufacturing sector by focusing on the stimuli to productivity growth. By focusing on the investment patterns of Food and Kindred Products Industry, this project will
• Examine the behavior of capital adjustment patterns of plants and firms
• Examine the dynamic factor demand decisions and resource allocations of the constituent units of the firm
• Examine long-argued capital measurement problems surrounding the time series data
• Investigate implications of the empirical evidence for the shape of the adjustment cost function
• Analyze productivity changes of plants and firms under these capital adjustment cost and investment patterns
• Identify and distinguish the gains from investment spikes as indicative of the lifting the plateau to a new one that can lead to longer periods of productivity growth from the productivity gains within an investment period.
Thus this proposal intends to take the literature one step further by investigating how capital and its adjustments influence productivity. Generally, plant-level studies analyzing productivity dynamics concentrate on the overall manufacturing plants in U.S., while studies analyzing productivity issues in the Food and Kindred Products industry primarily concentrate on the aggregate level. There are currently no studies that analyze the productivity dynamics at the most disaggregated plant level, considering all product subgroups of the food-manufacturing sector. With this study, we will be able to focus on investment patterns and lumpy capital adjustment costs separately analyzing all sub-industries of the food sector, which allows us to capture extensive heterogeneity within and across industries. The Food and Kindred Products industry is an excellent candidate for investigating lumpy investment patterns as the industry has become increasingly capital-intensive, and high-tech over the past few decades in the processing, packaging, and marketing of food products (Morrison, 1997). Therefore, the data required for this research is the U.S. Census’ Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) for the years 1963-1999 containing the annual establishment level production data for the manufacturing plants and firms specifically in Food and Kindred Products Industry. 
For an accurate measurement of productivity growth, we need to consider economies of scale, productivity enhancing changes arising from factors such as experience, learning-by-doing, increased knowledge, new innovations, better techniques for producing output, measuring relative capital intensity of production technology, existence of quasi-fixity of inputs, and the adjustment cost of these factors. As capital input is a significant component of total cost, analyzing the behavior of quasi-fixed factors in the measurement of productivity is crucial, especially if the firms require massive amounts of capital in the form of plant and equipment. Therefore, confidential Census data is essential to investigate the effect of capital adjustment on productivity and to develop a method, which can control for plant and firm fixed effects in measuring the productivity at plant and firm level. This research will provide benefit to the Census Bureau by developing a new improved measure of economic growth associated with investment spikes. This methodology removes procyclical biases associated with the business cycle. Thus it has the potential to propose changes in the questionnaire design and collection methodology to improve the economic content of the information gathered by the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM) and the Census of Manufacturers (CM) in the area of capital input series and total factor productivity at both the plant and firm level. By computing productivity at both levels, the researcher will be able to separately estimate both plant level productivity and firm level productivity in relation to aggregate level productivity. Previous studies have shown that aggregate growth measures may be significantly reduced when using the plant level data. Therefore the disaggregated measure of total factor productivity generated by this research will assist the Census Bureau in determining and evaluating whether the aggregation problem found in the literature is due to underlying economic forces or if it is possibly due to the questionnaire design or collection methodology.",True,,,,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjaa004,https://openalex.org/W2611356021,2020.0,Oxford University Press,True,journal-article,David Autor,1514.0,Economic Growth and Productivity,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance",2025-03-25T12:36:40.962826,,,,,,Step 2 Enriched Scraping + API,,,Step 2 Original_53
56,"investigating the influence of urbanicity on employment, commuting & wage earnings among people with disabilities",Chicago,2016,2018.0,Sandy Wong,"The 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits employment discrimination against Americans with disabilities, yet many individuals with disabilities continue to experience difficulty entering the labor market. While there is a wealth of research on the employment outcomes, wage earnings, and government program participation of people with disabilities in the U.S., there is relatively little consideration of how place of residence influences these trends. This project has three objectives: (1) to investigate the effect of urbanicity (how urban or rural a locality is) on the differential employment outcomes between people with and without disabilities; (2) to examine the influence of urbanicity and commute patterns (specifically commute time and travel mode) on the variance in wage earnings between people with and without disabilities; and (3) to analyze how urbanicity affects the degree to which Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients respond to survey questions related to disability. This research focuses on the working-age population (18-64 years of age) surveyed by the Census Bureau in 2000 and 2010-2014, two points in time following the enactment of the ADA.

Work will focus on manufacturing firms but will also investigate how banking law changes affect other sectors of the economy. The research uses the Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity (QPC), the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM), the Census of Manufactures (CMF), and the Longitudinal Business Database to analyze the effects of banking deregulation on plant-level output, employment, investment, productivity, and capital-to-labor ratios. Further, the project investigates the influence of banking deregulation on the market selection process and the reallocation of resources across manufacturing plants. The study will also use the Survey of Business Owners and the Integrated Longitudinal Business Database to provide a direct research link between credit markets and the productive sector by identifying firms that use debt to finance startup capital. This will allow the researchers to investigate whether banking deregulation affects access to credit for new businesses or the future performance and asset accumulation of borrowing firms. The research will benefit the Census Bureau by studying the quality of the data in the recently launched QPC. The researchers will compare the data in the QPC to data in the ASM and CMF, in addition to using the QPC (and it predecessor, the annual Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization) to study variation in capacity utilization rates across states. The analysis of capacity utilization variation will be performed in order to evaluate whether the QPC can be used to make inferences at the state level.  Finally, this work will benefit the Bureau by producing population estimates of how changes in state banking regulations affect firms' access to credit and asset accumulation, and how such changes influence the manufacturing sector in terms of the economic performance and input choices of plants, the reallocation of resources, and the market selection process.",True,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2010.01589.x,https://openalex.org/W2060032353,2010.0,Wiley,False,journal-article,Thorsten Beck,2257.0,"Banking stability, regulation, efficiency","Economics, Econometrics and Finance",2025-03-26T05:42:18.021398,0000-0002-2937-4773,,,,,Step 2 Enriched Scraping + API,,,Step 2 Original_57

It does so by performing three tasks. First, it creates annual estimates of the total value of exports from the data collected in the ASM and compares these estimates over time to related statistics in the U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services (FT990) series. Second, it performs the same type of comparisons for industries in which it is believed that the quality of related FT990 estimates has declined over the period of the study. Third, it uses the ASM data to examine whether there are systematic differences in export-growth rates across different types of manufacturing establishments.

76,the importance of relocations in u.s. manufacturing,Michigan,2006,2008.0,Yoonsoo Lee,"A firm can grow over a sustained period of time by renewing itself through recurrent responses to various internal and external challenges. In the short run, a firm expands and contracts its activities and the number of workers it employs. Some radical changes in the environment, however, may lead a firm to shut down a plant and start over in a new location. Because of this, competition among state and local governments to lure businesses has attracted considerable interest from economists, as well as legislators and decision-makers, regarding issues influencing relocation of a firm’s manufacturing activities. While this process of relocation can cause dramatic shifts in activity and employment at the regional levels, as well as at the firm levels, very little is known about the actual patterns of relocation in the U.S. economy. Only a few previous studies have looked at how manufacturing firms geographically locate their production, and most of these have focused on either small manufacturing samples or small geographic regions. This project expands on this previous work by summarizing the patterns of plant relocation and the post-move performance of relocated plants using the full population of manufacturing establishments in the United States over the period 1963-1999 using non-publicly available plant and firm level data from the U.S. Census Longitudinal Research Database (LRD). Focusing on an individual firm’s decision to relocate, this project analyzes information on the relocation of a firm’s manufacturing activities in the following three subprojects. First, this project assesses the relative importance of relocation across industries and regions by constructing industry level measures of entry, relocation, and exit. The study then examines whether relocation produces different patterns in plant openings and closings compared to de novo entry and permanent exit. Second, this project studies the characteristics of relocated plants along with their decision to relocate. Econometric model estimation will characterize how individual firms’ geographic shifts of production processes are influenced by taxes, unionization, factor prices, ownership, and other geographic and plant specific characteristics. Third, this project investigates the impact of geographic shifts on a firm’s post move production by comparing the growth rates of output and productivity for newly relocated plants to those of existing plants in the original location. The inverse growth-age relation suggested by Jovanovic’s (1982) firm- learning model is tested for relocating plants to examine whether the inverse growth-age relation observed among young firms also holds for relocating plants that start over in a new space. This project provides a number of benefits to the Census Bureau. These benefits include producing new statistics on the geographic movement of manufacturing activities at the firm level thereby suggesting a new way to expand the utility of the LRD in describing the geographic patterns of economic activities in the United States. Results of this research may also demonstrate the need for new measures of relocation to be incorporated in future surveys. Additionally by establishing links to the original plant of relocated plant, this research examines the consistency of geographic identifiers by potentially identifying previously undocumented coding problems and improves the understanding of regional linkages in the LRD. A better understanding of the dynamic geographic distribution of firm activity will help characterize the patterns of firm ownership that could be valuable for designing inquires on the Company organization survey that is an important Title 13 component of the Standard Statistical Establishment List.",True,,,,https://doi.org/10.2307/41166664,https://openalex.org/W1978399955,1991.0,SAGE Publishing,False,journal-article,Robert M.

78,estimating the determinants of private school enrollment: the role of school attendance zone racial and ethnic composition,Cornell,2016,2021.0,Salvatore Saporito,"Public schools are more racially segregated than the school attendance areas to which they supply services. Individual choice for private schools may play a substantial role in contributing to public school segregation, beyond what it would be if all students enrolled in the public school that served their residential area. One of three basic factors likely drives private school enrollment rates. First, children from one racial group, particularly white children, may be more likely to enroll in a private school as shares of non-white students in their school catchment areas increases. Second, members of all racial groups are less likely to enroll in private schools as shares of children in their catchment area who are of their same race increases. A third view is that race is inconsequential in driving private school enrollment. These competing models will be assessed by integrating three data sources: restricted-access American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year period estimates for 2005-2009, the School Attendance Boundary Information System (SABINS), which contains geography delineating school catchment areas for thousands of such areas for the 2009-2010 school year, and the Common Core of Data, which describes the characteristics of children who are enrolled in all public schools throughout the United States. Analyses of these three datasets will result in models estimating the probability that a child is enrolled in private school based on their race and the racial composition of the school catchment area in which they live, while holding constant a battery of family, attendance area, and school characteristics.",True,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.12099,https://openalex.org/W2101557912,2013.0,Wiley,False,journal-article,Christina Weiland,631.0,Early Childhood Education and Development,Social Sciences,2025-03-15T23:09:00.860565,0000-0001-7181-8799,,,,,Step 2 Enriched Scraping + API,,,Step 2 Original_78
79,civic engagement and citizens' context,Philadelphia,2021,2023.0,Lee Shaker,"This project examines the link between Americans' context--defined as their physical, social, and informational environment--and their civic engagement (e.g. participating in community groups, engaging in boycotts, etc.) in order to improve understanding of the Volunteering & Civic Life Supplement (VCL) of the Current Population Survey and suggest possible changes to its sampling strategy for future iterations. Traditionally, studies of civic engagement in the United States either use relatively small national surveys to give a general overview of Americans' behavior or employ mixed methods to delve more deeply into behavior within a handful of specific communities. To extend beyond these two approaches, I will use large Census datasets to conduct multilevel analysis of civic engagement nationwide that considers the influence of both individual and local/contextual factors. In addition, I will compare models created using the Census Civic Engagement Supplement (2008-2011, 2013) and VCL Supplement (2017-2019) datasets with similar models that include many other related political attitudes and behaviors measured by the General Social Survey and American National Election Survey (but with fewer respondents). This research offers three key benefits for Census. First, preparations for the analysis require detailed investigation of the previous year-by-year and country-by-county samples for the CES/VCL. This examination will underpin an assessment of the sampling frame's strengths and weaknesses for measuring civic engagement over time in disparate types of communities. Second, comparative analysis with external surveys that include measurement of additional related variables will contextualize findings from the VCL and improve our understanding of its results.

82,the human factor in corporate restructuring decisions,UCLA,2009,2013.0,Liu A Yang,"This study analyzes the link between the characteristics of firms’ labor forces (the human factor) and corporate restructuring decisions, such as plant closure and acquisitions. Specifically, it will analyze whether the labor composition and the wage structure of a plant or firm affects its probability of being shut down or of becoming a takeover target, and how factors such as experience, human capital, and wages explain the cross-sectional differences in worker retention decisions and firm performance following an acquisition or plant closure. The project uses employee information from the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) Program, firm-level information from the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), financial data from Compustat and information on corporate restructuring from the SDC Platinum Mergers and Acquisitions database. Additional data on manufacturing industries includes plant-level information from the Annual Survey of Manufactures and the Census of Manufactures to construct sharper estimates of changes in plant-level productivity around restructuring events. The project will evaluate the consistency of various databases maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau and analyze the implications of any inconsistencies on census published statistics. Accurate information on corporate restructuring is especially important for time series and worker statistics, such as those produced by the LEHD program. Moreover, since the SDC data documents the time when restructuring becomes effective in the legal sense and census databases record the time when real changes are made (in terms of labor and capital), comparing these two sources will provide valuable information on the length of the integration process. Statistics on the changes in workforce composition and the change in the wage distribution after restructuring will be produced.

A principal objective of the project is to build on prior work by linking additional years of import and export transaction data to the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and enhancing the existing match of 1993 and 2000 data. The additional years to link are 1992, and 1994–1999 (with the hope of obtaining (and linking) additional years of data from the Foreign Trade Division). The links are made via the EIN information on the import and export transaction files to the Standard Statistical Establishment List files (SSEL) and for exports to Canada, the link is made via business name. We propose to investigate improved matching methodologies using enhanced statistical matching algorithms. 
With the additional linked data, the project proposes to examine a number of issues to increase the Census Bureau’s understanding of the quality of data collected in Title 13, Chapter 5 programs. The topical areas to be investigated include multinational corporation import and export pricing and valuation behavior, geographic and product market entry, the impact of trade on the domestic economy, and treatment of inventory in transit.
