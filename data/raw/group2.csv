Vulnerable Jobs and the Wage Effects of Import Competition,https://doi.org/10.1111/irel.12240,"Do job characteristics modulate the relationship between import competition and workers’ wages? Using pooled cross‐sectional, linked employee‐establishment Census Bureau microdata and O* NET occupational characteristics, the paper models import competition and wages for more than 1.6 million individuals, grouped by job vulnerability defined by routineness, analytic complexity, and interpersonal interaction. Results show import competition is associated with wages that are: lower in routine and less complex jobs; higher in nonroutine and complex jobs; and higher for the highest and lowest levels of interpersonal interaction. This demonstrates the importance of accounting for occupational characteristics in understanding how trade and wages relate.",2019,2019-06-10,1,"{'David L. Rigby', 'Abigail M.

Impacts of Trade on Wage Inequality across the United States: Analysis Using Matched Employer-Employee Data - eScholarship,,"The research presented in this dissertation examines the impacts of trade from low-wage countries on U.S. labor markets. Analysis explores how imports from low-wage countries influence the wages of workers with high- and low-levels of education and how such trade may be related to growing wage inequality. Linkages between import competition and low-wage imports at the national level are extended to individual census regions to provide some of the first sub-national data linking trade and wage inequality. Standard models of trade impacts by education-skill categories also are extended to capture the influence of task-based characteristics of work. Finally, the effects of import competition from low-wage countries on the likelihood of plant closure are examined. Engaging with the most recent theoretical models of trade, the empirical analysis presented in this dissertation uses detailed microdata from the U.S. Census Bureau. Those data are used to link individual workers to manufacturing plants and firms. The resulting employer-employee files are appended with data on the task characteristics of different occupations and with measures of import competition built-up from individual trade transaction data. The result is one of the most comprehensive datasets yet built connecting measures of trade to the characteristics of jobs, workers and business establishments spanning the years 1992-2007. Analysis of these data yields insights into the socially and spatially uneven consequences of trade. This dissertation finds that low-wage import competition is significantly related to increased inequality, driving down wages for workers with low levels of formal education and driving up wages for workers with high levels of education. The results indicate that import competition increases the nonproduction worker share of total wages within establishments, another measure of wage inequality related to differences in worker skills/education. It also reveals that the relationship between wage inequality and low-wage import competition varies substantially across U.S. regions.

Coverage and Agreement of Administrative Records and 2010 American Community Survey Demographic Data,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ktmz9,"The U.S. Census Bureau is researching possible uses of administrative records in decennial census and survey operations. The 2010 Census Match Study and American Community Survey (ACS) Match Study represent recent efforts by the Census Bureau to evaluate the extent to which administrative records provide data on persons and addresses in the 2010 Census and 2010 ACS. The 2010 Census Match Study also examines demographic response data collected in administrative records. Building on this analysis, we match data from the 2010 ACS to federal administrative records and third party data as well as to previous census data and examine administrative records coverage and agreement of ACS age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin responses. We find high levels of coverage and agreement for sex and age responses and variable coverage and agreement across race and Hispanic origin groups. These results are similar to findings from the 2010 Census Match Study.",2017,2017-01-11,5,"{'Renuka Bhaskar', 'Adela Luque', 'Sonya Rastogi', 'James Noon'}",,"Health disparities and outcomes; Gender, Labor, and Family Dynamics; Healthcare Policy and Management",,preprint,Adela Luque,https://openalex.org/A5110302993,Decennial Census; Census Bureau,Decennial Census; Census Bureau,Washington
The Nature of the Bias When Studying Only Linkable Person Records: Evidence from the American Community Survey,,"Record linkage across survey and administrative records sources can greatly enrich data and improve their quality. The linkage can reduce respondent burden and nonresponse follow-up costs. This is particularly important in an era of declining survey response rates and tight budgets. Record linkage also creates statistical bias, however. The U.S. Census Bureau links person records through its Person Identification Validation System (PVS), assigning each record a Protected Identification Key (PIK). It is not possible to reliably assign a PIK to every record, either due to insufficient identifying information or because the information does not uniquely match any of the administrative records used in the person validation process. Non-random ability to assign a PIK can potentially inject bias into statistics using linked data. This paper studies the nature of this bias using the 2009 and 2010 American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS is well-suited for this analysis, as it contains a rich set of person characteristics that can describe the bias. We estimate probit models for whether a record is assigned a PIK. The results suggest that young children, minorities, residents of group quarters, immigrants, recent movers, low-income individuals, and non-employed individuals are less likely to receive a PIK using 2009 ACS. Changes to the PVS process in 2010 significantly addressed the young children deficit, attenuated the other biases, and increased the validated records share from 88.1 to 92.6 percent (person-weighted).",2014,2014-01-01,27,"{'Brittany Bond', 'Adela Luque', 'J.

Nonemployer Statistics by Demographics (NES-D): Using Administrative and Census Records Data in Business Statistics,,"The quinquennial Survey of Business Owners or SBO provided the only comprehensive source of information in the United States on employer and nonemployer businesses by the sex, race, ethnicity and veteran status of the business owners. The annual Nonemployer Statistics series (NES) provides establishment counts and receipts for nonemployers but contains no demographic information on the business owners. With the transition of the employer component of the SBO to the Annual Business Survey, the Nonemployer Statistics by Demographics series or NES-D represents the continuation of demographics estimates for nonemployer businesses. NES-D will leverage existing administrative and census records to assign demographic characteristics to the universe of approximately 24 million nonemployer businesses (as of 2015). Demographic characteristics include key demographics measured by the SBO (sex, race, Hispanic origin and veteran status) as well as other demographics (age, place of birth and citizenship status) collected but not imputed by the SBO if missing. A spectrum of administrative and census data sources will provide the nonemployer universe and demographics information. Specifically, the nonemployer universe originates in the Business Register; the Census Numident will provide sex, age, place of birth and citizenship status; race and Hispanic origin information will be obtained from multiple years of the decennial census and the American Community Survey; and the Department of Veteran Affairs will provide administrative records data on veteran status. The use of blended data in this manner will make possible the production of NES-D, an annual series that will become the only source of detailed and comprehensive statistics on the scope, nature and activities of U.S. businesses with no paid employment by the demographic characteristics of the business owner. Using the 2015 vintage of nonemployers, initial results indicate that demographic information is available for the overwhelming majority of the universe of nonemployers. For instance, information on sex, age, place of birth and citizenship status is available for over 95 percent of the 24 million nonemployers while race and Hispanic origin are available for about 90 percent of them. These results exclude owners of C-corporations, which represent only 2 percent of nonemployer firms. Among other things, future work will entail imputation of missing demographics information (including that of C-corporations), testing the longitudinal consistency of the estimates, and expanding the set of characteristics beyond the demographics mentioned above. Without added respondent burden and at lower imputation rates and costs, NES-D will meet the needs of stakeholders as well as the economy as a whole by providing reliable estimates at a higher frequency (annual vs. every 5 years) and with a more timely dissemination schedule than the SBO.",2019,2019-01-01,3,"{'Renuka Bhaskar', 'James Noon', 'Kevin Rinz', 'Adela Luque', 'Victoria Udalova'}",,Firm Innovation and Growth; Entrepreneurship Studies and Influences; Labor market dynamics and wage inequality,RePEc: Research Papers in Economics,preprint,Adela Luque,https://openalex.org/A5110302993,Decennial Census; Census Bureau,Decennial Census,Washington
Technology Use and Worker Outcomes: Evidence from Linked Employer Employee Data,,"In the course of our project we have produced several papers using the Survey of Manufacturing Technologies, the Business Register and the Decennial Census in combination with external Unemployment Insurance Earnings Record files from the State of Maryland. In this Technical Report we discuss the benefits to the Census Bureau based on the results of this project. We focus on four sets of results. First, economic survey data can be successfully integrated with Decennial and administrative record data to increase the value of existing economic data products. We show that the resulting sample sizes are sufficiently large to justify the effort. Second, we demonstrate that the Survey of Manufacturing Technologies (SMT) has a significant longitudinal component that approximates 15% of the sample of plants. The sample is not representative of the population of surviving firms of similar characteristics. However, sample weights can be created to address this issue. Third, we show the viability of using the SMT for single state studies. We find that the SMT Maryland sample is fairly representative of manufacturing plants in Maryland although they tend to be somewhat younger and larger than the average for the state. Fourth, we show that the composition of the workforce varies considerably across plants of different technological intensity. We show how integrated microeconomic data can be used to shed light on the underlying factors behind this variation.",2008,2008-01-01,0,"{'Javier Miranda', 'Adela Luque'}",,Firm Innovation and Growth; Italy: Economic History and Contemporary Issues,,article,Adela Luque,https://openalex.org/A5110302993,Decennial Census; Census Bureau,Decennial Census; Census Bureau,Washington

Using an event-study approach, we find that lottery wins lead to increases in firm hiring of college- educated, immigrant labor along with increases in scale and productivity.

Public-Use vs. Restricted-Use: An Analysis Using the American Community Survey,https://doi.org/10.29012/jpc.661,"Statistical agencies frequently publish microdata that have been altered to protect condentiality. Such data retain utility for many types of broad analyses but can yield biased or insufficiently precise results in others.

We investigate the advantages and disadvantages of public-use and restricted-use data from the American Community Survey (ACS) in constructing a wage index. The public-use data used were Public Use Microdata Samples, while the restricted-use data were accessed via a Federal Statistical Research Data Center. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each data source and compare estimated CWIs and standard errors at the state and labor market levels. We find the results from the publicly available data are generally good relative to the restricted-use data, with greater similarity for larger areas and less similarity for smaller areas.

Universal Mechanism to Link Multiple Datasets with Synthetic Populations for Clinical and Epidemiological Research,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-456335/v1,"Abstract Many modern predictive models require knowledge acquired from multiple datasets, yet data linkage can be a substantial challenge. Datasets exist in a wide variety of formats and linking them directly is often infeasible or restricted by privacy requirements. One solution is to map variables from different datasets onto a synthetic population, producing a dataset that contains information from multiple sources sufficient for reliable statistical inference with quantifiable uncertainty. This approach is universal because it is applicable to a broad range of datasets and has good potential for privacy protection.We consider datasets with information about individuals and describe three methods for building linked synthetic data: resampling, modeling predictors independently, and modeling predictors sequentially. We apply these methods to the prediction of the prevalence of Florida youth vaping by state, county, and census tract using the 2018 Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey (FYSAS) and the 5-Year American Community Survey (ACS). We find that resampling and sequential modeling most closely approximate the 2018 survey results, and that the sequential model captures more variability. We find that the order of predicting the variables in sequential modeling does not substantially impact the outcome.",2021,2021-05-06,0,"{'Alan F.

Predictors of Autism Spectrum Disorder and ADHD: Results from the National Survey of Children's Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2023.101512,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are two of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders with comorbidity rates of up to 70%. Population-based studies show differential rates of ADHD and ASD diagnosis based on sociodemographic variables. However, no studies to date have examined the role of sociodemographic factors on the likelihood of receiving an ADHD, ASD, or comorbid ASD+ADHD diagnosis in a large, nationally representative sample. This study aims to examine the impact of sociodemographic factors on the odds of experiencing ASD-only, ADHD-only, or both diagnoses for children in the United States. Using a mixed effects multinomial logistic modeling approach and data from the 2016-2018 National Survey of Children's Health, we estimated the association between sociodemographic variables and the log odds of being in each diagnostic group. Sociodemographic variables were differentially related to the three diagnostic groups: ASD-only, ADHD-only, and ASD+ADHD. Compared to girls, boys experienced higher odds of all three diagnosis categories. White children had higher odds of having an ADHD-only or ASD+ADHD diagnosis compared to Non-Hispanic (NH) Black, NH multiple/other race, and Hispanic children. Odds ratios for levels of parent education, household income, and birth characteristics showed varying trends across diagnostic groups. Overall, our findings point to unique sets of risk factors differentially associated ASD and ADHD, with lower income standing out as an important factor associated with receiving a diagnosis of ASD+ADHD.",2023,2023-08-02,10,"{'Jessica Bradshaw', 'Jan M.

Examining the association between rurality and positive childhood experiences among a national sample,https://doi.org/10.1111/jrh.12708,"Abstract Purpose The present study examines the association between rurality and positive childhood experiences (PCEs) among children and adolescents across all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Recent work has quantified the prevalence of PCEs at the national level, but these studies have been based on public use data files, which lack rurality information for 19 states. Methods Data for this cross‐sectional analysis were drawn from 2016 to 2018 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH), using the full data set with restricted geographic data (n = 63,000). Descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses were used to calculate proportions and unadjusted associations. Multivariable regression models were used to examine the association between residence and the PCEs that were significant in the bivariate analyses. Findings Rural children were more likely than urban children to be reported as having PCEs: volunteering in their community (aOR 1.29; 95% CI 1.18‐1.42), having a guiding mentor (aOR 1.75; 95% CI 1.45‐2.10), residing in a safe neighborhood (aOR 1.97; 95% CI 1.54‐2.53), and residing in a supportive neighborhood (aOR 1.10; 95% CI 1.01‐1.20) than urban children. Conclusions The assessment of rural‐urban differences in PCEs using the full NSCH is a unique opportunity to quantify exposure to PCEs. Given the higher baseline rate of PCEs in rural than urban children, programs to increase opportunities for PCEs in urban communities are warranted. Future research should delve further into whether these PCEs translate to better mental health outcomes in rural children.",2022,2022-08-27,8,"{'Janice C. Probst', 'Melinda A. Merrell', 'Jan M.

Changes in the Incidence and Duration of Periods without Insurance,https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmsa0804668,"Policymakers have recently proposed ways of providing health care coverage for an increased number of uninsured persons. However, there are few data that show how the incidence and duration of periods in which persons do not have insurance have changed over time.We used two data sets from the Survey of Income and Program Participation of the U.S. Census Bureau: one that covered the period from 1983 through 1986 (25,946 persons), and another that covered the period from 2001 through 2004 (40,282 persons). For each set of years, we estimated the probability that a person would be uninsured for some period of time and the probability that a person would subsequently obtain private or public insurance. We also estimated the probabilities that persons in various demographic groups would become uninsured over the course of a year and would remain uninsured for various amounts of time.The percentage of the population that lost insurance in a 12-month period increased from 19.8% in 1983-1986 to 21.8% in 2001-2004 (P=0.04).

The periods without insurance were shorter in 2001-2004 than they were in 1983-1986, since an increase in transitions to public coverage offset a reduction in transitions to private coverage.

The percentage of new uninsured periods that ended within 24 months increased from 73.8% to 79.7% between the two study periods (P Conclusions: As compared with the years from 1983 through 1986, from 2001 through 2004, more people, particularly those with the lowest educational level, had periods in which they were not insured. The periods without insurance were shorter in 2001-2004 than they were in 1983-1986, since an increase in transitions to public coverage offset a reduction in transitions to private coverage. Our results portend difficulties if private coverage continues to decline and is not offset by further expansions of public insurance.",2009,2009-04-28,0,"{'David Cutler', 'Alexander Gelber'}",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Pennsylvania,Healthcare Policy and Management; Global Health Care Issues; Food Security and Health in Diverse Populations,,article,Alexander M Gelber,https://openalex.org/A5091116830,Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Boston

Contributions to Health Insurance Premiums: When Does the Employer Pay 100 Percent?,,"ABSTRACT We identify the characteristics of establishments that paid 100 percent of health insurance premiums and the policies they offered from 1997-2001, despite increased premium costs. Analyzing data from the MEPS-IC, we see little change in the percent of establishments that paid the full cost of premiums for employees. Most of these establishments were young, small, single-units, with a relatively high paid workforce. Plans that were fully paid generally required referrals to see specialists, did not cover pre-existing conditions or outpatient prescriptions, and had the highest out-of-pocket expense limits. These plans also were more likely than plans not fully paid by employers to have had a fee-for-service or exclusive provider arrangement, had the highest premiums, and were less likely to be self-insured.

Declines in Employer Sponsored Health Insurance Coverage: Differences by Firm Size,,"Even before the current recession, employer-sponsored health insurance rates declined dramatically, falling 6.2 percentage points between 2000 and 2006 for non-elderly Americans. This decline reversed a previous upward trend from 1997 to 2000. During the last documented period of decline, 1987 to 1996, Cooper and Schone (1997) analyzed household survey data and demonstrated that the fall in employer-sponsored coverage was due to a decline in take-up rates for offered coverage, not a decline in employer offer rates. There has been little research since then that tracks the components of the more recent period of decline in employment related coverage. In this paper, we use data from private sector employers in the 2000 and 2008 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component (MEPS-IC). Using this data allows us to examine changes in employee-level coverage rates in combination with detailed data on employee premium contributions and the wage and firm size distribution of employers. Our work will establish a baseline that will help evaluate changes resulting from the anticipated enactment of health care reform legislation in the near future. We decompose overall changes in employee coverage rates into the following components: changes in the percent of employees in establishments that offer health insurance (offer rates), eligibility rates, overall percent of employees eligible for health insurance that are enrolled in health insurance (enrollment or take-up rates) and enrollment rates for single and family coverage among those eligible for coverage. We investigate whether there are differences in trends in these components by the firm size and wage distribution of employers. We provide descriptive statistics for these components, providing additional detail for enrollment rates on the relationship between mean enrollment rates and employee premium contributions. We also use econometric decomposition techniques to investigate whether changes in the components of coverage rates are due to changes in the explanatory variables or changes in coefficients.Preliminary analyses indicate that the underlying components of the more recent decline differ from those in the earlier period, particularly for the smallest firms (with < 10 workers). In those firms, offer rates declined and take-up rates increased. For the largest employers (with 1,000 or more workers) offer rates remained steady. Since eligibility rates remained steady in the smallest firms, the decline in access to coverage may be due to fewer offers. Among all but the smallest employers, the explanations for the decline in coverage rates echoed those of the earlier time period - declining take-up rates were responsible for the decline in coverage. These changes may reflect the increases in the share of total premiums paid by employees over this period for employees in the largest firms and those with 25-99 employees. In contrast, the share of total premiums remained steady for employees in the smallest firms which may explain their more stable trends in take-up rates.

The data available allowed HHI to be calculated for the period 1977–2002 in the case of advertising agencies and for 1997 and 2002 for the other industry sectors. At the holding company level, the four largest organizations account for only about a quarter of the industry's total revenue, a share that changed little over the period 2002–2008, but one that is approximately half of estimates frequently cited in the trade press.

Who Votes for Medicaid Expansion? Lessons from Maine's 2017 Referendum,https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-7530801,"Abstract Context: In November 2017, Maine became the first state in the nation to vote on a key provision of the Affordable Care Act: the expansion of Medicaid. Methods: This study merged official election results from localities across Maine with Census Bureau and American Hospital Association data to identify characteristics of areas that support Medicaid expansion. Findings: Places with more bachelor's degree holders more often vote in favor, whereas those with more associate's degree graduates tend to vote against. Conditional on education rates, areas with more uninsured individuals who would qualify for expanded coverage tend to vote in favor, while those with more high-income individuals tend to vote against. Also conditional on education rates, greater hospital employment is associated with support for expansion, but the presence of other health professionals, whose incomes might decrease from expansion, is associated with less support. Conclusions: Voting patterns are mostly consistent with economic self-interest, except for the sizable association of bachelor's degree holders with support for Medicaid expansion. Direct democracy can shift Medicaid policy: extrapolating to other states, the model predicts that hypothetical referenda would pass in 5 of the 18 states that had not yet expanded Medicaid at the time of Maine's vote.",2019,2019-04-12,5,"{'Amalia R.

Public Use Microdata Area Fragmentation: Research and Policy Implications of Polygon Discontiguity,https://doi.org/10.1007/bf03354886,"Abstract The American Community Survey (ACS) is created by the Unites States Census Bureau and contains the most recent and detailed information on the population. The U.S. Census Bureau releases Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) ACS files to allow public entities the ability to examine detailed individual-level data. In order to protect the confidentiality of survey participants, the Census only allows individual-level observations to be geographically referenced with Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs)—polygons that contain at least 100,000 people. Microdata files offer the unique advantage of creating custom tabulations on the population that are not made available elsewhere. The advantages from using PUMS files are limited by the typology of PUMAs. Our project fills a gap by introducing the reader to how PUMA typology is produced and how it affects research. The specific aim of this project is to highlight the fact that PUMAs can be fragmented—made up of physically non-adjacent/multi-part polygons. This is important because the treatment of fragmented/multi-part polygons as contiguous spatial entities erroneously imposes a false structure of contiguity that challenges theoretical and statistical assumptions in geographically aware research. By providing evidence from three metropolitan areas in Texas (USA) and displaying the degree of polygon discontiguity concentration by state, we outline some of the implications of polygon discontiguity for research and policy. We compliment our descriptive investigation by discussing solutions in closing and by identifying and discussing the three general elements in polygon fragmentation: quantity, distance, and size.",2013,2013-04-01,17,"{'Carlos Siordia', 'A J Fox'}",The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston; Texas A&M University,"Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Human Mobility and Location-Based Analysis; Spatial and Panel Data Analysis",Spatial Demography,article,Amber Fox,https://openalex.org/A5112605586,American Community Survey; FSRDC; Texas RDC; Decennial Census; Census Bureau,American Community Survey; Census Bureau,Texas
Plant-Level Productivity and Imputation of Missing Data in the Census of Manufactures,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1759396,"In the U.S. Census of Manufactures, the Census Bureau imputes missing values using a combination of mean imputation, ratio imputation, and conditional mean imputation.

We show that this appears to be the case for the existing imputations in the Census of Manufactures. We then present an alternative strategy for handling the missing data based on multiple imputation. Specifically, we impute missing values via sequences of classification and regression trees, which offer a computationally straightforward and flexible approach for semi-automatic, large-scale multiple imputation. We also present an approach to evaluating these imputations based on posterior predictive checks.

For five variables entering TFP, we show that dispersion is significantly smaller in the Census mean-imputed versus the nonimputed data.

Comments on: Laying the foundations for a new approach to Census taking in Ireland by John Dunne and Steve MacFeely,https://doi.org/10.3233/sji-140849,"The paper by Steve MacFeely and John Dunne sets forth the reasons to establish a National Data Infrastructure in Ireland. Among these are integrating crossnational themes of government efficiency, evidencebased policy, and open data. The use of public sector administrative data for census-taking is a natural use of a National Data Infrastructure, taking advantage of “joined-up data”. MacFeely and Dunne’s paper provides clear examples of the challenges of establishing such data, yet describes a path forward to realize needed efficiencies for Ireland. My comments and reactions relate to the paper as well as John Dunne’s presentation at the International Conference on Census Methods last summer. My colleagues at the U.S. Census Bureau sponsored the event to learn best practices from our international counterparts. We heard of common struggles and great ideas for moving forward, including the Irish initiative discussed in the MacFeely-Dunne paper. But first a bit about the U.S. Statistical System: The U.S. Federal Statistical System is comprised of 13 principal statistical agencies and over 100 statistical programs within Executive Branch agencies. The U.S. does not have a national statistics act. Separate legislative authorities set the domain and scope for each entity within the system. This has important implications for the utility of federal statistical information for Decennial Censuses or policymaking. The U.S. Census Bureau is the largest statistical agency in the U.S. Federal System and the leading source of quality data about the United States people and economy. Like Ireland and other countries, the Census Bureau is exploring uses of administrative records to reduce costs, reduce respondent burden, improve data quality, and produce new data products. The Census Bureau links data for statistical uses, not for enforcement or surveillance use. Statistical use means that information will not be used to make decisions concerning the rights, benefits, or privileges of specific individuals. As discussed at the conference, the U.S. is testing the statistical use of administrative records for the 2020 Census. These efforts build on decades of work describing and encouraging the efficient re-use of government records (e.g. [1,2]). The Census Bureau has heeded advice from the National Research Council [3] and invested in the infrastructure to acquire and link administrative data. The Census Bureau has conducted research to assess coverage and accuracy [5]. We are finding enormous opportunities for address registry and population measurement, analogous to what has happened in may countries in Europe. As the authors explain, integrated (Joined up) data are powerful. In the U.S., government agencies are working together to link data for program evaluation and policy analysis. However, the NDI in Ireland would also be used to achieve administrative efficiency by using person-level data for administrative/official interventions. These non-statistical uses are beyond the scope of work underway at the Census Bureau, Legislative change would be required to have joined-up data for government operations in the U.S. There is an effort to increase the use of administrative records government-wide in the U.S. [4].

Primary barriers to intra-agency data sharing include both perceived legal barriers and actual financial barriers. To address these problems, the potential path forward could include mandating data sharing for key sources, increasing transparency, and improving efficiency by making it easier for agencies to share data (including developing standards, templates, and incentives).

The Differential Privacy Corner: What has the US Backed Itself Into?,https://doi.org/10.23889/ijpds.v4i3.1315,"An expanding body of data privacy research reveals that computational advances and ever-growing amounts of publicly retrievable data increase re-identification risks. Because of this, data publishers are realizing that traditional statistical disclosure limitation methods may not protect privacy.&#x0D; This paper discusses the use of differential privacy at the US Census Bureau to protect the published results of the 2020 census. We first discuss the legal framework under which the Census Bureau intends to use differential privacy. The Census Act in the US states that the agency must keep information confidential, avoiding “any publication whereby the data furnished by any particular establishment or individual under this title can be identified.” The fact that Census may release fewer statistics in 2020 than in 2010 is leading scholars to parse the meaning of identification and reevaluate the agency’s responsibility to balance data utility with privacy protection.&#x0D; We then describe technical aspects of the application of differential privacy in the U.S. Census. This data collection is enormously complex and serves a wide variety of users and uses -- 7.8 billion statistics were released using the 2010 US Census. This complexity strains the application of differential privacy to ensure appropriate geographic relationships, respect legal requirements for certain statistics to be free of noise infusion, and provide information for detailed demographic groups.&#x0D; We end by discussing the prospects of applying formal mathematical privacy to other information products at the Census Bureau. At present, techniques exist for applying differential privacy to descriptive statistics, histograms, and counts, but are less developed for more complex data releases including panel data, linked data, and vast person-level datasets. We expect the continued development of formally private methods to occur alongside discussions of what privacy means and the policy issues involved in trading off protection for accuracy.",2019,2019-11-25,0,"{'Amy O’Hara', 'Quentin Brummet'}",Georgetown University,Census and Population Estimation; Privacy-Preserving Technologies in Data,International Journal for Population Data Science,article,Amy B O'Hara,https://openalex.org/A5010637520,Commercial Black Knight Assessment Data (ASMT); Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Georgetown
Neighborhood Attainment over the Adult Life Course,https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122416673029,"This study uses data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, in conjunction with neighborhood-level data from the U.S. decennial census and American Community Survey, to examine the trajectory of individuals’ neighborhood characteristics from initial household formation into mid-to-late adulthood. Multilevel growth curve models reveal both different starting points and different life course trajectories for blacks and whites in neighborhood economic status and neighborhood racial composition. Among respondents who first established an independent household during the 1970s, improvement in neighborhood income over the adult life course was substantially greater for white than for black respondents; the racial difference in the percentage of neighbors who were non-Hispanic white narrowed slightly with age. Racial differences in the characteristics of neighborhoods inhabited during adolescence help explain racial differences in starting points and, to a lesser extent, subsequent trajectories of neighborhood attainment. Residing in an economically advantaged neighborhood during adolescence confers greater subsequent benefits in neighborhood economic status for white than for black respondents. We use these findings to begin developing a life course perspective on neighborhood attainment.",2016,2016-10-28,63,"{'Kyle Crowder', 'Ying Huang', 'Amy Spring', 'Scott J.

Evaluation of Selective Editing for the US Census Bureau Foreign Trade Data 1,,"The Foreign Trade Division at the US Census Bureau is responsible for the production of monthly import and export statistics. Data processing begins with extensive micro-editing using an automated editing and imputation system; records that do not pass the edits are automatically imputed. However, imputation may not be successful for a small portion of the edit-failing records. Records for which imputation is not successful are sent to subject matter experts for manual review. Commodity analysts use their expertise to manually adjust failing records and must review a large number of records under tight time constraints before the publication of monthly statistics deadline. Due to the time and resource constraints, we have an ongoing effort to improve the current procedures while preserving (or improving) data quality. We investigate selective editing strategies for these data. Selective editing requires a score function to assign a priority ranking to erroneous records. We propose a score function that includes a measure of how suspicious a record is and a measure of the anticipated error in the suspicious record. We present methodology and results of an evaluation study of the application of selective editing to foreign trade export data.",2013,2013-01-01,0,"{'Christopher Grieves', 'Andreana Able', 'María M.

Development of a multidimensional housing and environmental quality index (HEQI): application to the American Housing Survey,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12940-022-00866-8,"Abstract Background Substandard housing conditions and hazardous indoor environmental exposures contribute to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Housing indices that capture the multiple dimensions of healthy housing are important for tracking conditions and identifying vulnerable households. However, most indices focus on physical deficiencies and repair costs and omit indoor environmental exposures, as few national data sources routinely collect this information. Methods We developed a multidimensional Housing and Environmental Quality Index (HEQI) based on the World Health Organization’s Housing and Health Guidelines and applied it to the 2019 American Housing Survey (AHS). The HEQI consisted of ten domains associated with poor health: household fuel combustion, dampness and mold, pests and allergens, lead paint risk, high indoor temperatures, low indoor temperatures, household crowding, injury hazards, inadequate water and sanitation, and ventilation. We evaluated the validity and performance of the HEQI against three housing characteristics (i.e., year built, monthly rent costs, unit satisfaction rating) and two established indices (i.e., Adequacy Index, Poor Quality Index). Results Approximately 79% (92 million) of U.S. households reported at least one HEQI domain associated with poor health (mean per household: 1.3; range: 0,8). Prevalent domains included household fuel combustion (61.4%), dampness and mold (15.9%), inadequate water and sanitation (14.3%), and injury hazards (11.9%). Pests and allergens, low indoor temperatures, and injury hazards were consistently associated with older homes, lower rent costs, and lower unit satisfaction. Compared to established housing indices, the HEQI captured four new environmental domains which enabled the identification of 57.7 million (63%) more households with environmental risk factors like mold, cockroaches, crowding, household fuel combustion, and higher building leakage. Conclusions Indoor environmental exposures are prevalent in U.S. households and not well-captured by existing housing indices. The HEQI is a multidimensional tool that can be used to monitor indoor environmental exposures and housing quality trends in the U.S. Some domains, including radon, pesticides, asbestos, noise, and housing accessibility could not be assessed due to the lack of available data in the AHS.

The trade-offs of teamwork among STEM doctoral graduates.,https://doi.org/10.1037/amp0000288,"Teamwork has increasingly become prevalent in professional fields such as academic science, perhaps partly because research shows that teams tend to produce superior work. Although research on teamwork has typically focused on its impact on work products, we complement that work by examining the degree to which teamwork influences salary, hours worked, and overall job satisfaction. Drawing on microdata collected through the National Science Foundation's Survey of Doctorate Recipients as well as the Survey of Earned Doctorates, we find that doctoral degree holders in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields tend to earn substantially higher salaries and work more hours when they engage in teamwork. We also find no comparable difference in overall job satisfaction as a function of whether individuals work within teams. Additionally, we find evidence that age interacts significantly with teamwork, whereby older teamworkers tend to earn relatively more when participating in teams without appearing to work more hours; and we show that employment sector is important, whereby teamwork is relevant for salaries and hours worked in education and industry but not in government. Although our study is based on market outcomes and behavioral measures, our findings provide grounds for future research that examines the psychological mechanisms that are relevant to understanding why people join teams as well as the psychological consequences that people encounter through teamwork. More generally, this study provides a model for considering individual-level antecedents and outcomes associated with teamwork when degrees of discretion exist with respect to teaming.

Accounting for Demographic and Salary Changes among Business School Faculty,https://doi.org/10.5465/ambpp.2020.21357abstract,"This article examines patterns of change among Business and non-Business PhD cohorts in the United States as well as comparisons across Business subfields. By drawing upon responses to the Survey of Earned Doctorates, we track changes in the backgrounds of doctoral graduates and find a trend over the past 20 years towards more gender, ethnic, and citizenship diversity. We also find that PhD cohorts in Business opt for Industry employment at approximately the same rate as non-Business PhD cohorts while very few pursue “postdoc” employment. We show substantial differences whereby Business salaries tend to be diverging towards nearly twice the income paid to non-Business doctoral graduates and – among the Business subfields – we find a wide range with Accounting earning the highest wages and Human Resources being paid the lowest. Our findings suggest that Business School faculty are not paid relatively high wages due to private-sector competition as is conventionally assumed; instead, it seems plausible that the salary differential exists partly to compensate for the typically higher wages earned by the non-PhD graduates that business schools train. Alternate explanations include the possibility that there current Business School faculty salaries are the unsustainable result of runaway competition among schools. Greater awareness and exploration of the types of patterns that we report offers important baselines for (prospective) PhD students and their advisors.

Primarily used for marketing, we describe EDDM's efficacy as a research tool for remotely recruiting a representative convenience sample of rural Appalachian households for a longitudinal survey-based health study. In June 2020, recruitment postcards were sent via EDDM to all residential addresses (n = 31,201) within an 18 ZIP code region of Southeastern Ohio. Adults were invited to complete a survey online via QR code or to call for a mailed survey. Respondent demographic characteristics were generated using SPSS and compared with the region's 2019 U.S. Census Bureau statistics. A total of 841 households responded to the invitation, reflecting a response rate higher than marketing estimates (2.7 % vs 2 %). Compared to Census data, a greater proportion of respondents were female (74 % vs 51 %), and highly educated (64 % vs 36 % college graduates); a comparable proportion were non-Hispanic (99 % vs 98 %), white (90 % vs 91 %), and had ≥ 1 adult in the household (1.7 ± 0.9); and a lower proportion had a household income < $50 k (47 % vs 54 %).

Furthermore, the authors show that using the sample of the working-age population with disabilities identified by the six-question sequence will lead to biased estimates of key social policy success parameters; in particular, it will overestimate their employment rates and underestimate the share that are receiving Social Security Disability Insurance or Supplemental Security Income-Disabled Adults benefits relative to the broader sample that includes a work-limitation question and the six-question sequence.",2012,2012-06-05,74,"{'Andrew J.

Mandated by federal statute, six dichotomous difficulty-focused questions were implemented in national surveys to identify people with disabilities. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence, demographic characteristics and social factors among people with disabilities based on these six questions using multiple national surveys in the USA. Setting American Community Survey (ACS), Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS-ASEC), National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). Participants Civilian, non-institutionalised US residents aged 18 and over from the 2009 to 2014 ACS, 2009 to 2014 CPS-ASEC, 2009 to 2014 NHIS and 2008 SIPP waves 3, 7 and 10. Primary and secondary outcome measures Disability was assessed using six standardised questions asking people about hearing, vision, cognition, ambulatory, self-care and independent living disabilities. Social factors were assessed with questions asking people to report their education, employment status, family size, health and marital status, health insurance and income. Results Risk ratios and demographic distributions for people with disabilities were consistent across survey. People with disabilities were at decreased risk of having college education, employment, families with three or more people, excellent or very good self-reported health and a spouse. People with disabilities were also consistently at greater risk of having health insurance and living below the poverty line. Estimates of disability prevalence varied between surveys from 2009 to 2014 (range 11.76%–17.08%). Conclusion Replicating the existing literature, we found the estimation of disparities and inequity people with disabilities experience to be consistent across survey.

Usefulness of Internet Surveys to Identify People with Disabilities: A Cautionary Tale,https://doi.org/10.1093/jssam/smaa045,"Abstract Disability is an important characteristic to consider in survey research. However, people with disabilities are a hard-to-reach population. Internet survey methods offer tremendous potential to expand researchers’ ability to reach and learn about people with disabilities. The goal of this study is to examine potential bias when using nonprobability Internet samples to investigate demographics and socioeconomic outcomes of people with disabilities. We compare the findings based on a national employment and disability survey instrument fielded to four samples: (1) a random-digit dial (RDD) sample, (2) a prescreened sample from a nonprobability Internet access panel, for which screening was based on the presence of 139 previously reported health conditions, (3) an unscreened sample from another nonprobability Internet access panel (without previously prescreened health conditions), and (4) a mixed nonprobability self-recruited (river and snowball) sample. Each sample was weighted on four demographic variables (gender, age, race/ethnicity, and region) using benchmarks from the American Community Survey (ACS). Three dichotomous outcome variables of interest (level of education, household income, and current employment status) were contrasted with weighted population estimates from the ACS. Results showed that the sample resulting from the RDD and all three nonprobability Internet samples differed significantly from ACS population estimates on all three outcome variables. Reweighting to include type of functional disability did not significantly reduce dissimilarities with ACS for any of the four samples. Nonprobability Internet survey methods offer relatively low-cost, easy-to-use avenues for disability-related research. Yet, researchers must proceed with caution to reduce or avoid known sources of bias in both the methodology and the interpretation of results.",2021,2021-01-04,4,"{'Andrew J.

Place‐based subsidies and employment growth in rural America: Evidence from the broadband initiatives programme,https://doi.org/10.1111/pirs.12740,"This paper studies the labour market effects of the Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP), a programme authorized by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to promote broadband deployment, mainly in rural areas. The BIP is one of the largest USDA broadband programmes implemented to date, providing more than $3.4 billion in grants and loans in FY 2010. We investigate the impacts of BIP investments on employment outcomes in BIP-recipient Census tracts compared to similar tracts outside of BIP project service areas between the inception of the programme in 2010 and 2019. We use a quasi-experimental research design that combines difference-in-difference regression with propensity score matching estimation to identify the causal effect of the BIP investments on employment outcomes. We find that the BIP investments had a positive overall effect on employment growth that increased over time. The subsidized investments had a greater effect on employment in startups than in incumbent businesses, in the goods-producing sector and the information and communications technology sector than other sectors, and a greater effect in micropolitan census tracts than tracts located in metropolitan areas or in small town and remote rural locations. Este artículo estudia los efectos en el mercado laboral del Programa de Iniciativas de Banda Ancha (BIP, por sus siglas en inglés), un programa autorizado por la Ley de Recuperación y Reinversión de Estados Unidos de 2009 para promover el despliegue de la banda ancha, principalmente en zonas rurales. El BIP es uno de los mayores programas de banda ancha del USDA ejecutados hasta la fecha, y en el 2010 concedió más de 3.400 millones de dólares en subvenciones y préstamos. Se investigaron los impactos de las inversiones del BIP en los resultados de empleo en los tramos censales receptores de BIP en comparación con tramos similares fuera de las áreas cubiertas por el proyecto BIP entre el inicio del programa en 2010 y 2019. Se utilizó un diseño de investigación cuasi-experimental que combina la regresión de diferencias en diferencias con una estimación basada en pareamiento por puntaje de propensión para identificar el efecto causal de las inversiones del BIP en los resultados de empleo. Las inversiones del BIP tuvieron un efecto global positivo en el crecimiento del empleo, que aumentó con el tiempo. Las inversiones subvencionadas tuvieron un mayor efecto sobre el empleo en las empresas de nueva creación que en las ya existentes, en el sector de la producción de bienes y en el sector de las tecnologías de la información y las comunicaciones que en otros sectores, y un mayor efecto en los tramos censales micropolitanos que en los situados en áreas metropolitanas o en localidades rurales pequeñas y remotas. 本稿では、2009年アメリカ復興・再投資法によって認可された、主に農村地域におけるブロードバンドの導入を促進するためのプログラムであるブロードバンド・イニシアティブ・プログラム(Broadband Initiatives Program:BIP)の労働市場への影響を検討する。BIPは、2010年度には34億ドル以上の補助金と融資を提供しており、これまでに実施された米国農務省のブロードバンド・プログラムの中でも最大規模である。プログラムが開始された2010年から2019年までの、国勢統計区におけるBIP受給者の雇用成果に対するBIP投資の影響を、BIPプロジェクトのサービス対象地域以外の同様の地域と比較して調査した。差分の差分法と傾向スコアマッチング推定を組み合わせた疑似実験デザインを用いて、BIP投資が雇用成果に及ぼす因果効果の解明を試みた。BIP投資は全体的に雇用増加に全体的なプラスの効果をもたらし、さらにその効果は時間の経過とともに増大した。補助金による投資は、既存の企業の雇用よりもスタートアップの雇用に大きな影響を与え、他の部門よりも財生産部門や情報通信技術部門に大きな影響を与え、小都市の国勢統計区では大都市圏や小さな町あるいは僻地の国勢統計区よりも大きな影響を与えていた。 The deployment of high-speed broadband in underserved rural areas has become an important rural development policy over the last two decades. Benefits of access to broadband in rural areas are manifold, including business development through reduced input costs and e-commerce, job growth through business creation and expansion, access to healthcare and telemedicine, and other benefits (Abrardi & Cambini, 2019; Atasoy, 2013; Benda et al., 2020; Duvivier, 2019; Goldfarb & Tucker, 2019; Stenberg et al., 2009). However, broadband deployment in rural underserved areas is expensive due to remoteness and sparse population in these places, requiring very large up-front capital expenditures by service providers (Kandilov & Renkow, 2010). As a result, 17% of rural Americans did not have access to fixed terrestrial broadband service anywhere in their census block in December 2019 (Federal Communications Commission (FCC), 2021), while 41% of rural households did not have wired high-speed Internet service in their homes in November 2021 (National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), 2022). Federal investments in the United States promoting access to broadband in rural communities have been increasing over the last two decades. During fiscal years 2015 to 2020, the Federal Government spent more than $50 billion to promote broadband deployment and use through 12 programmes, focused mainly on rural areas, and Congress has appropriated nearly $75 billion for 13 new broadband programmes established since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), 2022). The general objective of many of these programmes is to provide broadband infrastructure in unserved and underserved areas, which is expected to stimulate improvements in social and economic well-being in these areas. This paper explores the impacts of one of these federal investments—the USDA Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP)—on employment growth. Several USDA programmes have supported broadband development in rural areas in the United States for the past two decades. The BIP is one of the largest of these programmes, created by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, which appropriated a total of $2.5 billion to USDA's Rural Utilities Service (RUS) to promote broadband deployment, mainly in rural areas of the country. Despite the large size of the BIP and length of time since the programme was completed, few published studies have investigated impacts of this programme, except two recent papers by Bai et al. (2022) and Pender et al. (2022). 1 This paper contributes to this small literature by investigating the impacts of BIP on employment, which was not addressed in either of those studies. The impacts of provision of broadband infrastructure on employment growth and other socio-economic outcomes depend on whether such infrastructure results in increased adoption and use of broadband, or use of broadband at higher speeds than previously, by businesses, households, and other end users. 2 Unfortunately, data on adoption and use of broadband by businesses are not generally available. Existing empirical evidence on effects of broadband availability on broadband adoption by households supports the notion that increased availability leads to more adoption, especially in rural areas (Pender et al., 2022; Silva et al., 2018; Whitacre et al., 2013). In addition to finding that initial broadband availability contributes to subsequent household broadband adoption, Pender et al. (2022) found that BIP increased the average share of households adopting broadband by about 1.1–3.0 percentage points by 2016. Beyond the effect of BIP on broadband adoption, there is the question of how the programme affected socio-economic outcomes such as employment growth. The socio-economic benefits of increasing access to broadband in rural communities are widely documented as described in the literature review below. However, no published studies have investigated impacts of the BIP on employment growth and few studies have investigated employment impacts of any Federal broadband programme. In this study, we investigate the impacts of the BIP on employment growth in BIP-recipient census tracts compared to similar census tracts outside of BIP project service areas between the inception of the programme in 2010 and 2019. The expectation from a policy perspective was that the BIP would lead to increased access to broadband in unserved and underserved areas, promoting economic growth by saving existing jobs and creating more. However, theoretically, the employment impacts of such investment incentives are ambiguous. Although broadband investments may increase job opportunities due to the direct employment and multiplier effects of broadband deployment and maintenance, promotion of new business formation, retention and expansion of existing businesses, attraction of workers, reduction in search costs in labour markets, and other factors, they may also reduce employment in some regions or for some types of workers due to increased competition or substitution of local labour by capital expenditures or outsourcing of work to other firms and locations (Akerman et al., 2015; Atasoy, 2013; Duvivier, 2019; Goldfarb & Tucker, 2019; Kolko, 2012; Kuttner, 2016; Stephens et al., 2022). In addition to investigating the impact of BIP on overall employment changes, we examine whether employment effects are heterogeneous between incumbent establishments and startups, across broad industry sectors, and across the urban/rural spectrum. Although the BIP was intended to be mainly focused on rural areas, it was not strictly limited to such areas, and the programme service areas included areas located within metropolitan and micropolitan areas. 3 Earlier research has found that broadband provision has resulted in positive net establishment entry in the United States (Chen et al., 2023), which is the largest source of employment growth impacts of broadband provision, though broadband also has contributed to employment growth in incumbent businesses (Kolko, 2012). The literature has also shown that employment impacts of broadband provision vary across industry sectors (Atasoy, 2013; Kandilov & Renkow, 2010; Kolko, 2012; Shideler et al., 2007) and between urban and rural markets (Atasoy, 2013; Kandilov & Renkow, 2010; Kolko, 2012; Lobo et al., 2020; Whitacre et al., 2014b). Thus, we expect that the impacts of BIP may differ between incumbent businesses and startups and across industry sectors and geographic contexts. Our analysis uses a reduced form approach, investigating the effects of BIP on employment outcomes without investigating the mediating mechanisms by which such outcomes may have occurred due to data limitations—such as the lack of publicly available data on broadband adoption by businesses. It assumes that broadband deployment through BIP investments translates into adoption by consumers and businesses, influencing employment outcomes in programme recipient areas. We find that BIP investments had a positive effect on employment growth overall, with the impacts generally increasing over time. BIP had a greater effect on employment in startups than incumbent businesses, in the goods-producing sector and information and communication technology (ICT) subsector than in other sectors, and in micropolitan census tracts than in metropolitan and remote rural locations. Broadband can affect regional employment through many mechanisms. Broadband deployment can increase the demand for labour since labour is required to manufacture, deploy, and maintain the necessary infrastructure and parts (Atasoy, 2013), some of which may be provided by workers within a given region. Such direct employment effects may have indirect and induced multiplier effects on local labour demand (Kuttner, 2016). Broadband can affect demand for the goods and services produced in a region by increasing access of local firms to more distant markets and competition with more distant firms (Atasoy, 2013). Broadband may affect the productivity of firms, which can have mixed effects on labour demand depending on the substitution or complementarity relationships between the technologies that broadband enables and different types/skill levels of labour (Akerman et al., 2015; Atasoy, 2013). By increasing access to information and the productivity of firms, broadband availability may attract firms (especially those in knowledge-intensive industries) to startup or relocate to a region with better broadband service and a sufficiently skilled workforce (Atasoy, 2013; Chen et al., 2023; Conroy & Low, 2022; Deller et al., 2022; Duvivier, 2019; Kim & Orazem, 2017; Kolko, 2012; Mack, 2014, 2015; Mack & Rey, 2014; Mack et al., 2011; Mack, 2014; Mack & Rey, 2014; Mack & Wentz, 2017; Shideler & Badasyan, 2012; Stephens et al., 2022; Whitacre et al., 2014a, 2014b). Broadband access may help existing firms survive and grow (Kolko, 2012), though it may also undermine survival of local businesses by increasing competition with distant providers of goods and services (Stephens et al., 2022). All these mechanisms can affect the demand for labour in a region (Kolko, 2012). Broadband can also affect the supply of labour in a region. As a consumer amenity providing improved access to goods and services that affect quality of life, broadband can affect migration (Mahasuweerachai et al., 2010) and home buying decisions (Deller & Whitacre, 2019; Molnar et al., 2019) and thus the supply of labour in a region. Broadband access enables telework (Carvalho et al., 2022; Pender et al., 2022), which may attract people to live and telework in places that were previously too distant to commute from. Broadband also can reduce search costs in the labour market for job applicants and employers, helping to reduce unemployment and vacancies (Goldfarb & Tucker, 2019) and improve the worker-firm matching process (Atasoy, 2013). Broadband access (especially mobile broadband) may also facilitate peer-to-peer markets for employment opportunities (""gig jobs"") such as Uber/Lyft drivers and domestic services (Abraham et al., 2019; Goldfarb & Tucker, 2019). A large and growing literature on broadband finds positive effects of high-speed internet on economic outcomes at a local level (usually the county or zip code level) in the United States, particularly labour market outcomes. Numerous studies have found a positive association of broadband availability with employment and/or a negative association with unemployment (Atasoy, 2013; Bai, 2017; Guidry et al., 2012; Isley & Low, 2022; Jayakar & Park, 2013; Kolko, 2012; Lobo et al., 2020; Shideler et al., 2007; Stenberg et al., 2009; Whitacre et al., 2014b). Not all studies have found positive effects of broadband availability on employment, however. Several found statistically insignificant effects, particularly when examining impacts of broadband deployment on changes in employment over time (Ford, 2018; Jayakar & Park, 2013; Whitacre et al., 2014a, 2014b, 2018). The impacts of broadband availability on employment have been found in several studies to be context dependent. For example, Kolko (2012) found that the employment impacts of broadband provision were greater in less densely populated Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs). Similarly, Atasoy (2013) found that the positive effect of broadband availability on employment rate was greater in more rural areas, especially those with more skilled workers. By contrast, Whitacre et al. (2014b) found, using cross-sectional spatial error model (SEM) regressions, that high broadband availability was positively associated with greater total employment in metro counties but not in nonmetro counties, while they found no statistically significant effect of changes in broadband availability on employment change in either metro or nonmetro counties using first difference ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions. In a study of impacts of broadband availability on county-level unemployment rates in Tennessee, Lobo et al. (2020) found a significant negative association of high-speed broadband with unemployment rates, but only in rural counties. Thus several, but not all, studies that investigated the effects of rurality found greater impacts of improvements in broadband availability on employment in more rural areas. Several studies have found a positive association of broadband adoption with employment or a negative association with unemployment (Carvalho et al., 2022; Isley & Low, 2022; Whitacre et al., 2014a, 2014b). Although Whitacre et al. (2014b) found a positive association between high broadband adoption and total employment in nonmetro counties in their cross-sectional SEM regressions, they found no statistically significant impact of broadband adoption on employment in their first difference OLS regressions, so this result for impacts of broadband adoption was not robust to the method used. Carvalho et al. (2022) investigated the effects of broadband adoption combined with the ability of workers to telework, on county unemployment rates in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, finding that counties in the southeastern United States with greater initial adoption of broadband and a greater share of the workforce able to telework had less growth in unemployment. One study by Forman et al. (2012) investigated the impacts of commercial businesses' use of advanced Internet applications—which depend on broadband availability and adoption by businesses—on county employment growth in the late 1990s. That study found a weakly statistically significant (at 10% level) positive effect of use of advanced Internet applications on county employment growth, with this effect concentrated in counties with high levels of household income, education, information technology intensity, and population. Fewer studies have investigated impacts of programmes designed to increase broadband availability or adoption on employment outcomes. Several studies have investigated impacts of the USDA Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program (RBLP) and its predecessor, the pilot Broadband Loan Program (BBLP) (Dinterman & Renkow, 2017; Kandilov & Renkow, 2010, 2020; Kandilov et al., 2017; U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), 2014). Of these studies, only Kandilov and Renkow (2010) and U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) (2014) investigated impacts of these programmes on employment. 4 Kandilov and Renkow (2010) investigated impacts of the pilot BBLP and RBLP at both zip code and county level, focusing on zip code areas or counties that had a population of 20,000 or less in the year 2000. They found a positive impact of the pilot BBLP on employment in their baseline regression at the zip code level and a small and statistically insignificant impact of the RBLP on employment. They argued that the more limited effects of the RBLP could have been due to the limited amount of time between when loans began to be administered under that programme in 2004 and the end of their study period in 2007. They found that the pilot BBLP had a positive association with employment only in metro counties, while in nonmetro counties not adjacent to a metro area, both the pilot BBLP and the RBLP had a negative association with employment. They found no statistically significant impact of either programme on total employment in county-level regressions. Across industries, they found a negative impact of the pilot BBLP on employment in information services, negative impacts of the RBLP on employment in utilities and retail trade, and a positive impact of the RBLP on employment in the real estate and rental industry. They argued that the negative effects of these broadband programmes on employment in some sectors could be due to competition for local businesses facilitated by broadband access. In general, Kandilov and Renkow's results demonstrate that a broadband programme can have heterogeneous effects on employment in different geographic contexts and industries, and likely also depend on how much time has elapsed since the inception of the programme. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) (2014) also investigated impacts of the RBLP on employment, using county-level regressions and focusing on a longer period than Kandilov and Renkow (2010) (2003–2011). Unlike Kandilov and Renkow, U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) (2014) found robust positive impacts of the RBLP on employment across several analyses with alternative control groups, using its baseline sample of counties with at least 90% of the county population residing in a rural area or an urban cluster of less than 50,000 people. Using instead a more restrictive definition of rural counties—excluding people in urban clusters—U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) (2014) found statistically insignificant impacts of the RBLP on employment. The lack of significant impacts with the more rural sample of counties reflects a much smaller sample of counties classified as ""rural"" having received RBLP loans, resulting in larger standard errors of the estimated impacts, and does not necessarily reflect actual heterogeneity of impacts between more and less rural counties. Two peer-reviewed studies have investigated impacts of the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP)—the sister programme to the BIP also funded by ARRA—on broadband adoption (Chang, 2021; Hauge & Prieger, 2015). Both these studies found statistically insignificant impacts of BTOP grants on broadband adoption. Two recent peer-reviewed studies have investigated impacts of BIP (Bai et al., 2022; Pender et al., 2022). Bai et al. (2022) investigated the impact of BIP on farm productivity (defined as farm sales per farm employment), finding a significant positive but short-term impact on farm productivity. Pender et al. (2022) investigated the impact of BIP on broadband adoption and telework, finding positive impacts on both outcomes. No published peer-reviewed study that we are aware of has investigated impacts of either BTOP or BIP on employment outcomes. The available literature suggests that a programme such as BIP, which financed deployment of broadband infrastructure in mostly (but not only) rural areas, could have affected employment in recipient areas through multiple mechanisms, with possibly different impacts on employment in business startups than on employment in incumbent businesses. The literature also suggests the impacts may have been heterogeneous across geographic contexts and industries. The present study contributes to the literature by investigating the impacts of BIP on employment, which has not been reported in any published studies. We investigate the heterogeneity of BIP impacts on employment across several dimensions, including geography, industry, and whether employment change occurred in startup or incumbent business at the time BIP was initiated. The Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) was authorized as a part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, which appropriated $2.5 billion to U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Utilities Service (RUS) to promote broadband deployment in rural areas of the country. ARRA also expanded the existing authority of RUS to make loans and provided new authority to make grants for the purpose of facilitating broadband deployment in rural communities. RUS leveraged the budget authority provided by ARRA to make grants, loans and loan/grant combination awards. In total, over $2.23 billion in grants and $1.19 billion in loans were made to 299 terrestrial broadband infrastructure projects throughout the country. 5 All BIP awards were made in two rounds in FY 2010. ARRA required the project service areas to be at least 75% rural (in terms of area) and without broadband availability at 5 megabits per second (mbps) (upstream plus downstream) in at least 50% of each project service area. Rural areas were defined as: ""Any area, as confirmed by the latest decennial census of the Bureau of the Census, which is not located within: (1) a city, town, or incorporated area that has a population of greater than 20,000 inhabitants; or (2) an urbanized area contiguous and adjacent to a city or town that has a population of greater than 50,000 inhabitants."" Based on these criteria, project service areas are mostly at the subcounty level, and some of the qualified rural areas are located within metro counties. Infrastructure projects supported by this programme were almost entirely (95%) last mile infrastructure projects and nearly two thirds of the projects (65%) provided fibre optic service to the household or business. Grants in the first round could only support projects serving exclusively remote unserved rural areas but this requirement was dropped in the second round. However, a counterfactual for the employment of BIP-recipient tracts, if they had not received BIP investments, can be estimated using the employment of tracts that never received BIP investments. This assumes that the mean outcome observed for the tracts that never received BIP investments is the same as the mean outcome that would have been observed for the treated group if they had not received BIP. However, approximating the counterfactual level for BIP-recipient tracts by using non-recipient tracts, our estimates of the ATET are likely to be affected by selection bias due to the presence of observable or unobservable differences between the treated and never treated tracts that are associated with differences in outcomes. One drawback of PSM estimation alone is that it controls only for differences in observable characteristics of treated and control groups and not for unobservable differences. Selection bias can be further reduced by combining PSM with difference-in-difference (DiD) estimation, which estimates impacts of treatment on changes in the outcome variable between pre- and post-treatment periods, thus subtracting out the additive effects of fixed characteristics, whether observed or not. 7 Thus we combine PSM with DiD estimation. The primary data sources for the study are BIP data from the USDA Rural Utilities Service (RUS), American Community Survey (ACS) data from the Census Bureau, Federal Communication Commission (FCC) data, and National Establishment Time-Series (NETS) data from Walls & Associates. All the data used in the analysis are at the census tract level using Census 2010 tract boundaries. Digitized maps of BIP areas and other RUS broadband programmes were provided by RUS and used to identify the share of tracts that were in a BIP project service area or service areas of other broadband programmes. Census tract-level demographic, housing, and industry employment share information were obtained from the ACS. Tract-level broadband availability information was obtained from the FCC. All tract-level employment data were compiled from the National Establishment Time-Series (NETS) data. The NETS is a longitudinal establishment-level database constructed by Walls & Associates using business-level data from Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) Market Identifier (DMI) files. Walls & Associates compiles repeated cross sections of the underlying D&B data on employment, sales and other variables into a longitudinal series using the unique D&B identification number (the DUNS number). They claim to cover nearly every US business unit that has operated in the United States over the past three decades, including sole proprietors, small privately owned firms, farms, nonprofit organizations and public sector establishments, such as post offices and public schools. Business data based on D&B DMI data have been criticized as not suitable for analysis (Davis et al., 1996). These criticisms claim that births and younger/smaller businesses are underreported and that there are discrepancies in the total U.S. employment figures in DMI files and data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, several more recent studies (Choi et al., 2013; Kunkle, 2011; Neumark et al., 2007, 2011) that investigated the accuracy of NETS data found fault with some of the above criticisms. Neumark et al. (2011) found that the claim of the underreporting of births in the NETS is without merit. They also claimed that the NETS data has better coverage of small business owners compared to those reported under the Statistics of Business (SOB) data. The main reason for the greater representation of smaller businesses in the NETS than in official business data sets is due to the inclusion of nonemployers in the NETS and imputing a value of 1 for the number of employees for nonemployer establishments. Most recently, Barnatchez et al. (2017) conducted a critical review of NETS data and concluded that the main discrepancies between NETS and official sources are largely driven by differences among small establishments and that NETS data greatly overrepresent establishments with less than 10 employees. They also highlighted issues with industry labeling that affect the comparability of results between the NETS and official business statistics and suggested that while the NETS is generally suitable for static analyses of establishments and employment across geographies or industries, it is less useful for studying business dynamics, though it is unclear how they arrived at this conclusion. RUS shape files of BIP project service areas 8 were overlaid on 2010 census tract boundaries using GIS software, 9 and the share of area of each census tract within BIP project service areas was computed. In our base analyses, we classified a census tract as ""treated"" by BIP if at least 90% of the tract area was in a BIP project service area. In robustness checks of our analysis, we investigate the robustness of our results to alternative thresholds of the minimum share of BIP area in a tract used to classify a tract as treated. All control tracts used in the analysis had no BIP project service areas intersecting the tract, and any tracts that included project service areas of any other RUS broadband programmes were excluded from the analysis. To implement the DiD/PSM design, treated tracts were defined in our base models as tracts with at least 90% of their area in a BIP project service area. 10 We selected a comparison group of tracts from among non-BIP areas. We excluded census tracts served by other USDA telecommunications programmes before matching and limited the control census tracts to those within 50 miles of the boundary of a treated tract.

Place‐based subsidies and employment growth in rural America: Evidence from the broadband initiatives programme,https://doi.org/10.1111/pirs.12740,"This paper studies the labour market effects of the Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP), a programme authorized by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to promote broadband deployment, mainly in rural areas. The BIP is one of the largest USDA broadband programmes implemented to date, providing more than $3.4 billion in grants and loans in FY 2010. We investigate the impacts of BIP investments on employment outcomes in BIP-recipient Census tracts compared to similar tracts outside of BIP project service areas between the inception of the programme in 2010 and 2019. We use a quasi-experimental research design that combines difference-in-difference regression with propensity score matching estimation to identify the causal effect of the BIP investments on employment outcomes. We find that the BIP investments had a positive overall effect on employment growth that increased over time. The subsidized investments had a greater effect on employment in startups than in incumbent businesses, in the goods-producing sector and the information and communications technology sector than other sectors, and a greater effect in micropolitan census tracts than tracts located in metropolitan areas or in small town and remote rural locations. Este artículo estudia los efectos en el mercado laboral del Programa de Iniciativas de Banda Ancha (BIP, por sus siglas en inglés), un programa autorizado por la Ley de Recuperación y Reinversión de Estados Unidos de 2009 para promover el despliegue de la banda ancha, principalmente en zonas rurales. El BIP es uno de los mayores programas de banda ancha del USDA ejecutados hasta la fecha, y en el 2010 concedió más de 3.400 millones de dólares en subvenciones y préstamos. Se investigaron los impactos de las inversiones del BIP en los resultados de empleo en los tramos censales receptores de BIP en comparación con tramos similares fuera de las áreas cubiertas por el proyecto BIP entre el inicio del programa en 2010 y 2019. Se utilizó un diseño de investigación cuasi-experimental que combina la regresión de diferencias en diferencias con una estimación basada en pareamiento por puntaje de propensión para identificar el efecto causal de las inversiones del BIP en los resultados de empleo. Las inversiones del BIP tuvieron un efecto global positivo en el crecimiento del empleo, que aumentó con el tiempo. Las inversiones subvencionadas tuvieron un mayor efecto sobre el empleo en las empresas de nueva creación que en las ya existentes, en el sector de la producción de bienes y en el sector de las tecnologías de la información y las comunicaciones que en otros sectores, y un mayor efecto en los tramos censales micropolitanos que en los situados en áreas metropolitanas o en localidades rurales pequeñas y remotas. 本稿では、2009年アメリカ復興・再投資法によって認可された、主に農村地域におけるブロードバンドの導入を促進するためのプログラムであるブロードバンド・イニシアティブ・プログラム(Broadband Initiatives Program:BIP)の労働市場への影響を検討する。BIPは、2010年度には34億ドル以上の補助金と融資を提供しており、これまでに実施された米国農務省のブロードバンド・プログラムの中でも最大規模である。プログラムが開始された2010年から2019年までの、国勢統計区におけるBIP受給者の雇用成果に対するBIP投資の影響を、BIPプロジェクトのサービス対象地域以外の同様の地域と比較して調査した。差分の差分法と傾向スコアマッチング推定を組み合わせた疑似実験デザインを用いて、BIP投資が雇用成果に及ぼす因果効果の解明を試みた。BIP投資は全体的に雇用増加に全体的なプラスの効果をもたらし、さらにその効果は時間の経過とともに増大した。補助金による投資は、既存の企業の雇用よりもスタートアップの雇用に大きな影響を与え、他の部門よりも財生産部門や情報通信技術部門に大きな影響を与え、小都市の国勢統計区では大都市圏や小さな町あるいは僻地の国勢統計区よりも大きな影響を与えていた。 The deployment of high-speed broadband in underserved rural areas has become an important rural development policy over the last two decades. Benefits of access to broadband in rural areas are manifold, including business development through reduced input costs and e-commerce, job growth through business creation and expansion, access to healthcare and telemedicine, and other benefits (Abrardi & Cambini, 2019; Atasoy, 2013; Benda et al., 2020; Duvivier, 2019; Goldfarb & Tucker, 2019; Stenberg et al., 2009). However, broadband deployment in rural underserved areas is expensive due to remoteness and sparse population in these places, requiring very large up-front capital expenditures by service providers (Kandilov & Renkow, 2010). As a result, 17% of rural Americans did not have access to fixed terrestrial broadband service anywhere in their census block in December 2019 (Federal Communications Commission (FCC), 2021), while 41% of rural households did not have wired high-speed Internet service in their homes in November 2021 (National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), 2022). Federal investments in the United States promoting access to broadband in rural communities have been increasing over the last two decades. During fiscal years 2015 to 2020, the Federal Government spent more than $50 billion to promote broadband deployment and use through 12 programmes, focused mainly on rural areas, and Congress has appropriated nearly $75 billion for 13 new broadband programmes established since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), 2022). The general objective of many of these programmes is to provide broadband infrastructure in unserved and underserved areas, which is expected to stimulate improvements in social and economic well-being in these areas. This paper explores the impacts of one of these federal investments—the USDA Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP)—on employment growth. Several USDA programmes have supported broadband development in rural areas in the United States for the past two decades. The BIP is one of the largest of these programmes, created by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, which appropriated a total of $2.5 billion to USDA's Rural Utilities Service (RUS) to promote broadband deployment, mainly in rural areas of the country. Despite the large size of the BIP and length of time since the programme was completed, few published studies have investigated impacts of this programme, except two recent papers by Bai et al. (2022) and Pender et al. (2022). 1 This paper contributes to this small literature by investigating the impacts of BIP on employment, which was not addressed in either of those studies. The impacts of provision of broadband infrastructure on employment growth and other socio-economic outcomes depend on whether such infrastructure results in increased adoption and use of broadband, or use of broadband at higher speeds than previously, by businesses, households, and other end users. 2 Unfortunately, data on adoption and use of broadband by businesses are not generally available. Existing empirical evidence on effects of broadband availability on broadband adoption by households supports the notion that increased availability leads to more adoption, especially in rural areas (Pender et al., 2022; Silva et al., 2018; Whitacre et al., 2013). In addition to finding that initial broadband availability contributes to subsequent household broadband adoption, Pender et al. (2022) found that BIP increased the average share of households adopting broadband by about 1.1–3.0 percentage points by 2016. Beyond the effect of BIP on broadband adoption, there is the question of how the programme affected socio-economic outcomes such as employment growth. The socio-economic benefits of increasing access to broadband in rural communities are widely documented as described in the literature review below. However, no published studies have investigated impacts of the BIP on employment growth and few studies have investigated employment impacts of any Federal broadband programme. In this study, we investigate the impacts of the BIP on employment growth in BIP-recipient census tracts compared to similar census tracts outside of BIP project service areas between the inception of the programme in 2010 and 2019. The expectation from a policy perspective was that the BIP would lead to increased access to broadband in unserved and underserved areas, promoting economic growth by saving existing jobs and creating more. However, theoretically, the employment impacts of such investment incentives are ambiguous. Although broadband investments may increase job opportunities due to the direct employment and multiplier effects of broadband deployment and maintenance, promotion of new business formation, retention and expansion of existing businesses, attraction of workers, reduction in search costs in labour markets, and other factors, they may also reduce employment in some regions or for some types of workers due to increased competition or substitution of local labour by capital expenditures or outsourcing of work to other firms and locations (Akerman et al., 2015; Atasoy, 2013; Duvivier, 2019; Goldfarb & Tucker, 2019; Kolko, 2012; Kuttner, 2016; Stephens et al., 2022). In addition to investigating the impact of BIP on overall employment changes, we examine whether employment effects are heterogeneous between incumbent establishments and startups, across broad industry sectors, and across the urban/rural spectrum. Although the BIP was intended to be mainly focused on rural areas, it was not strictly limited to such areas, and the programme service areas included areas located within metropolitan and micropolitan areas. 3 Earlier research has found that broadband provision has resulted in positive net establishment entry in the United States (Chen et al., 2023), which is the largest source of employment growth impacts of broadband provision, though broadband also has contributed to employment growth in incumbent businesses (Kolko, 2012). The literature has also shown that employment impacts of broadband provision vary across industry sectors (Atasoy, 2013; Kandilov & Renkow, 2010; Kolko, 2012; Shideler et al., 2007) and between urban and rural markets (Atasoy, 2013; Kandilov & Renkow, 2010; Kolko, 2012; Lobo et al., 2020; Whitacre et al., 2014b). Thus, we expect that the impacts of BIP may differ between incumbent businesses and startups and across industry sectors and geographic contexts. Our analysis uses a reduced form approach, investigating the effects of BIP on employment outcomes without investigating the mediating mechanisms by which such outcomes may have occurred due to data limitations—such as the lack of publicly available data on broadband adoption by businesses. It assumes that broadband deployment through BIP investments translates into adoption by consumers and businesses, influencing employment outcomes in programme recipient areas. We find that BIP investments had a positive effect on employment growth overall, with the impacts generally increasing over time. BIP had a greater effect on employment in startups than incumbent businesses, in the goods-producing sector and information and communication technology (ICT) subsector than in other sectors, and in micropolitan census tracts than in metropolitan and remote rural locations. Broadband can affect regional employment through many mechanisms. Broadband deployment can increase the demand for labour since labour is required to manufacture, deploy, and maintain the necessary infrastructure and parts (Atasoy, 2013), some of which may be provided by workers within a given region. Such direct employment effects may have indirect and induced multiplier effects on local labour demand (Kuttner, 2016). Broadband can affect demand for the goods and services produced in a region by increasing access of local firms to more distant markets and competition with more distant firms (Atasoy, 2013). Broadband may affect the productivity of firms, which can have mixed effects on labour demand depending on the substitution or complementarity relationships between the technologies that broadband enables and different types/skill levels of labour (Akerman et al., 2015; Atasoy, 2013). By increasing access to information and the productivity of firms, broadband availability may attract firms (especially those in knowledge-intensive industries) to startup or relocate to a region with better broadband service and a sufficiently skilled workforce (Atasoy, 2013; Chen et al., 2023; Conroy & Low, 2022; Deller et al., 2022; Duvivier, 2019; Kim & Orazem, 2017; Kolko, 2012; Mack, 2014, 2015; Mack & Rey, 2014; Mack et al., 2011; Mack, 2014; Mack & Rey, 2014; Mack & Wentz, 2017; Shideler & Badasyan, 2012; Stephens et al., 2022; Whitacre et al., 2014a, 2014b). Broadband access may help existing firms survive and grow (Kolko, 2012), though it may also undermine survival of local businesses by increasing competition with distant providers of goods and services (Stephens et al., 2022). All these mechanisms can affect the demand for labour in a region (Kolko, 2012). Broadband can also affect the supply of labour in a region. As a consumer amenity providing improved access to goods and services that affect quality of life, broadband can affect migration (Mahasuweerachai et al., 2010) and home buying decisions (Deller & Whitacre, 2019; Molnar et al., 2019) and thus the supply of labour in a region. Broadband access enables telework (Carvalho et al., 2022; Pender et al., 2022), which may attract people to live and telework in places that were previously too distant to commute from. Broadband also can reduce search costs in the labour market for job applicants and employers, helping to reduce unemployment and vacancies (Goldfarb & Tucker, 2019) and improve the worker-firm matching process (Atasoy, 2013). Broadband access (especially mobile broadband) may also facilitate peer-to-peer markets for employment opportunities (""gig jobs"") such as Uber/Lyft drivers and domestic services (Abraham et al., 2019; Goldfarb & Tucker, 2019). A large and growing literature on broadband finds positive effects of high-speed internet on economic outcomes at a local level (usually the county or zip code level) in the United States, particularly labour market outcomes. Numerous studies have found a positive association of broadband availability with employment and/or a negative association with unemployment (Atasoy, 2013; Bai, 2017; Guidry et al., 2012; Isley & Low, 2022; Jayakar & Park, 2013; Kolko, 2012; Lobo et al., 2020; Shideler et al., 2007; Stenberg et al., 2009; Whitacre et al., 2014b). Not all studies have found positive effects of broadband availability on employment, however. Several found statistically insignificant effects, particularly when examining impacts of broadband deployment on changes in employment over time (Ford, 2018; Jayakar & Park, 2013; Whitacre et al., 2014a, 2014b, 2018). The impacts of broadband availability on employment have been found in several studies to be context dependent. For example, Kolko (2012) found that the employment impacts of broadband provision were greater in less densely populated Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs). Similarly, Atasoy (2013) found that the positive effect of broadband availability on employment rate was greater in more rural areas, especially those with more skilled workers. By contrast, Whitacre et al. (2014b) found, using cross-sectional spatial error model (SEM) regressions, that high broadband availability was positively associated with greater total employment in metro counties but not in nonmetro counties, while they found no statistically significant effect of changes in broadband availability on employment change in either metro or nonmetro counties using first difference ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions. In a study of impacts of broadband availability on county-level unemployment rates in Tennessee, Lobo et al. (2020) found a significant negative association of high-speed broadband with unemployment rates, but only in rural counties. Thus several, but not all, studies that investigated the effects of rurality found greater impacts of improvements in broadband availability on employment in more rural areas. Several studies have found a positive association of broadband adoption with employment or a negative association with unemployment (Carvalho et al., 2022; Isley & Low, 2022; Whitacre et al., 2014a, 2014b). Although Whitacre et al. (2014b) found a positive association between high broadband adoption and total employment in nonmetro counties in their cross-sectional SEM regressions, they found no statistically significant impact of broadband adoption on employment in their first difference OLS regressions, so this result for impacts of broadband adoption was not robust to the method used. Carvalho et al. (2022) investigated the effects of broadband adoption combined with the ability of workers to telework, on county unemployment rates in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, finding that counties in the southeastern United States with greater initial adoption of broadband and a greater share of the workforce able to telework had less growth in unemployment. One study by Forman et al. (2012) investigated the impacts of commercial businesses' use of advanced Internet applications—which depend on broadband availability and adoption by businesses—on county employment growth in the late 1990s. That study found a weakly statistically significant (at 10% level) positive effect of use of advanced Internet applications on county employment growth, with this effect concentrated in counties with high levels of household income, education, information technology intensity, and population. Fewer studies have investigated impacts of programmes designed to increase broadband availability or adoption on employment outcomes. Several studies have investigated impacts of the USDA Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program (RBLP) and its predecessor, the pilot Broadband Loan Program (BBLP) (Dinterman & Renkow, 2017; Kandilov & Renkow, 2010, 2020; Kandilov et al., 2017; U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), 2014). Of these studies, only Kandilov and Renkow (2010) and U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) (2014) investigated impacts of these programmes on employment. 4 Kandilov and Renkow (2010) investigated impacts of the pilot BBLP and RBLP at both zip code and county level, focusing on zip code areas or counties that had a population of 20,000 or less in the year 2000. They found a positive impact of the pilot BBLP on employment in their baseline regression at the zip code level and a small and statistically insignificant impact of the RBLP on employment. They argued that the more limited effects of the RBLP could have been due to the limited amount of time between when loans began to be administered under that programme in 2004 and the end of their study period in 2007. They found that the pilot BBLP had a positive association with employment only in metro counties, while in nonmetro counties not adjacent to a metro area, both the pilot BBLP and the RBLP had a negative association with employment. They found no statistically significant impact of either programme on total employment in county-level regressions. Across industries, they found a negative impact of the pilot BBLP on employment in information services, negative impacts of the RBLP on employment in utilities and retail trade, and a positive impact of the RBLP on employment in the real estate and rental industry. They argued that the negative effects of these broadband programmes on employment in some sectors could be due to competition for local businesses facilitated by broadband access. In general, Kandilov and Renkow's results demonstrate that a broadband programme can have heterogeneous effects on employment in different geographic contexts and industries, and likely also depend on how much time has elapsed since the inception of the programme. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) (2014) also investigated impacts of the RBLP on employment, using county-level regressions and focusing on a longer period than Kandilov and Renkow (2010) (2003–2011). Unlike Kandilov and Renkow, U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) (2014) found robust positive impacts of the RBLP on employment across several analyses with alternative control groups, using its baseline sample of counties with at least 90% of the county population residing in a rural area or an urban cluster of less than 50,000 people. Using instead a more restrictive definition of rural counties—excluding people in urban clusters—U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) (2014) found statistically insignificant impacts of the RBLP on employment. The lack of significant impacts with the more rural sample of counties reflects a much smaller sample of counties classified as ""rural"" having received RBLP loans, resulting in larger standard errors of the estimated impacts, and does not necessarily reflect actual heterogeneity of impacts between more and less rural counties. Two peer-reviewed studies have investigated impacts of the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP)—the sister programme to the BIP also funded by ARRA—on broadband adoption (Chang, 2021; Hauge & Prieger, 2015). Both these studies found statistically insignificant impacts of BTOP grants on broadband adoption. Two recent peer-reviewed studies have investigated impacts of BIP (Bai et al., 2022; Pender et al., 2022). Bai et al. (2022) investigated the impact of BIP on farm productivity (defined as farm sales per farm employment), finding a significant positive but short-term impact on farm productivity. Pender et al. (2022) investigated the impact of BIP on broadband adoption and telework, finding positive impacts on both outcomes. No published peer-reviewed study that we are aware of has investigated impacts of either BTOP or BIP on employment outcomes. The available literature suggests that a programme such as BIP, which financed deployment of broadband infrastructure in mostly (but not only) rural areas, could have affected employment in recipient areas through multiple mechanisms, with possibly different impacts on employment in business startups than on employment in incumbent businesses. The literature also suggests the impacts may have been heterogeneous across geographic contexts and industries. The present study contributes to the literature by investigating the impacts of BIP on employment, which has not been reported in any published studies. We investigate the heterogeneity of BIP impacts on employment across several dimensions, including geography, industry, and whether employment change occurred in startup or incumbent business at the time BIP was initiated. The Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) was authorized as a part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, which appropriated $2.5 billion to U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Utilities Service (RUS) to promote broadband deployment in rural areas of the country. ARRA also expanded the existing authority of RUS to make loans and provided new authority to make grants for the purpose of facilitating broadband deployment in rural communities. RUS leveraged the budget authority provided by ARRA to make grants, loans and loan/grant combination awards. In total, over $2.23 billion in grants and $1.19 billion in loans were made to 299 terrestrial broadband infrastructure projects throughout the country. 5 All BIP awards were made in two rounds in FY 2010. ARRA required the project service areas to be at least 75% rural (in terms of area) and without broadband availability at 5 megabits per second (mbps) (upstream plus downstream) in at least 50% of each project service area. Rural areas were defined as: ""Any area, as confirmed by the latest decennial census of the Bureau of the Census, which is not located within: (1) a city, town, or incorporated area that has a population of greater than 20,000 inhabitants; or (2) an urbanized area contiguous and adjacent to a city or town that has a population of greater than 50,000 inhabitants."" Based on these criteria, project service areas are mostly at the subcounty level, and some of the qualified rural areas are located within metro counties. Infrastructure projects supported by this programme were almost entirely (95%) last mile infrastructure projects and nearly two thirds of the projects (65%) provided fibre optic service to the household or business. Grants in the first round could only support projects serving exclusively remote unserved rural areas but this requirement was dropped in the second round. However, a counterfactual for the employment of BIP-recipient tracts, if they had not received BIP investments, can be estimated using the employment of tracts that never received BIP investments. This assumes that the mean outcome observed for the tracts that never received BIP investments is the same as the mean outcome that would have been observed for the treated group if they had not received BIP. However, approximating the counterfactual level for BIP-recipient tracts by using non-recipient tracts, our estimates of the ATET are likely to be affected by selection bias due to the presence of observable or unobservable differences between the treated and never treated tracts that are associated with differences in outcomes. One drawback of PSM estimation alone is that it controls only for differences in observable characteristics of treated and control groups and not for unobservable differences. Selection bias can be further reduced by combining PSM with difference-in-difference (DiD) estimation, which estimates impacts of treatment on changes in the outcome variable between pre- and post-treatment periods, thus subtracting out the additive effects of fixed characteristics, whether observed or not. 7 Thus we combine PSM with DiD estimation. The primary data sources for the study are BIP data from the USDA Rural Utilities Service (RUS), American Community Survey (ACS) data from the Census Bureau, Federal Communication Commission (FCC) data, and National Establishment Time-Series (NETS) data from Walls & Associates. All the data used in the analysis are at the census tract level using Census 2010 tract boundaries. Digitized maps of BIP areas and other RUS broadband programmes were provided by RUS and used to identify the share of tracts that were in a BIP project service area or service areas of other broadband programmes. Census tract-level demographic, housing, and industry employment share information were obtained from the ACS. Tract-level broadband availability information was obtained from the FCC. All tract-level employment data were compiled from the National Establishment Time-Series (NETS) data. The NETS is a longitudinal establishment-level database constructed by Walls & Associates using business-level data from Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) Market Identifier (DMI) files. Walls & Associates compiles repeated cross sections of the underlying D&B data on employment, sales and other variables into a longitudinal series using the unique D&B identification number (the DUNS number). They claim to cover nearly every US business unit that has operated in the United States over the past three decades, including sole proprietors, small privately owned firms, farms, nonprofit organizations and public sector establishments, such as post offices and public schools. Business data based on D&B DMI data have been criticized as not suitable for analysis (Davis et al., 1996). These criticisms claim that births and younger/smaller businesses are underreported and that there are discrepancies in the total U.S. employment figures in DMI files and data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, several more recent studies (Choi et al., 2013; Kunkle, 2011; Neumark et al., 2007, 2011) that investigated the accuracy of NETS data found fault with some of the above criticisms. Neumark et al. (2011) found that the claim of the underreporting of births in the NETS is without merit. They also claimed that the NETS data has better coverage of small business owners compared to those reported under the Statistics of Business (SOB) data. The main reason for the greater representation of smaller businesses in the NETS than in official business data sets is due to the inclusion of nonemployers in the NETS and imputing a value of 1 for the number of employees for nonemployer establishments. Most recently, Barnatchez et al. (2017) conducted a critical review of NETS data and concluded that the main discrepancies between NETS and official sources are largely driven by differences among small establishments and that NETS data greatly overrepresent establishments with less than 10 employees. They also highlighted issues with industry labeling that affect the comparability of results between the NETS and official business statistics and suggested that while the NETS is generally suitable for static analyses of establishments and employment across geographies or industries, it is less useful for studying business dynamics, though it is unclear how they arrived at this conclusion. RUS shape files of BIP project service areas 8 were overlaid on 2010 census tract boundaries using GIS software, 9 and the share of area of each census tract within BIP project service areas was computed. In our base analyses, we classified a census tract as ""treated"" by BIP if at least 90% of the tract area was in a BIP project service area. In robustness checks of our analysis, we investigate the robustness of our results to alternative thresholds of the minimum share of BIP area in a tract used to classify a tract as treated. All control tracts used in the analysis had no BIP project service areas intersecting the tract, and any tracts that included project service areas of any other RUS broadband programmes were excluded from the analysis. To implement the DiD/PSM design, treated tracts were defined in our base models as tracts with at least 90% of their area in a BIP project service area. 10 We selected a comparison group of tracts from among non-BIP areas. We excluded census tracts served by other USDA telecommunications programmes before matching and limited the control census tracts to those within 50 miles of the boundary of a treated tract.

Induced Discrimination and Firm Size: Information Vs Incentive Effects,,"An investigation is conducted to determine the effectsof incentives and information disadvantagesin the adoption of practicesin small firms, with specific regard to firm responses to the Civil Rights Actof 1991 (CRA91). Person Records from the Census Bureau Current PopulationSurvey data for the years 1989-1997 are used to assess discriminatorybehaviorarising from CRA91, due to the perceived higher cost and risk oflitigation associated with hiring minorities and women. Results indicate that both small and large firms responded to CRA91. Inmedium and large firms, discrimination was shown to decrease in the first yearCRA91 was implemented. Conversely, discrimination increased in the years thatfollowed. Little evidence was found for the hypothesis that smaller firms areless likely to respond to CRA91 due to a lack of information that may resultfrom broadcast and contagion effects. It is also observed that damageintroduced by CRA91 has increased the inherent wages of protected groupemployees. Consequently, these wages create incentives for firms todiscriminate against protected groups during the hiring process. The findingssuggest that firms' behaviors correspond with their economic incentives. It isconcluded that there is no firm size disadvantage in the dispersal ofinformation about CRA91.

A Renter or Homeowner Nation,,"Between the 1940s and the 1960s, the U.S. homeownership rate increased by nearly 20 percentage points, from mid-40 to mid-60 percent. The self-amortizing 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage, introduced by the Federal Housing Administration/Veterans Administration (VA-now the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs) transformed the United States from a nation of renters to a nation of homeowners (Acolin and Wachter, 2015; Fetter, 2013).For three decades, from the mid-1960s through the mid-1990s, the homeownership rate remained stable, at around 64 percent (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015a), until recent volatility. Although aggregate homeownership rates were remarkably steady, so were gaps across demographic groups. The gap is about 20 percentage points (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015a). The persistence of this gap has important consequences for the national homeownership rate in the future, because the United States is expected to become a majority-minority nation in the next 20 years.1In this article, we look back to explain the decades of homeownership stability and ask whether, after housing markets complete their recovery from the excesses of the housing market expansion and collapse, we will return to the post-WWII normal in which nearly two out of three households own or whether homeownership is likely to continue its postrecession fall over the coming decades, with an end result that we are no longer a nation of homeowners.To be specific, this article addresses this proposition: By 2050 the U.S. homeownership rate... will have fallen at least 20 percentage points. If this proposition is true, it will mean that within less than 40 years, the United States will transform once again, this time from a nation of homeowners to a nation of renters. Is this scenario possible? Is it likely? To address these questions, we undertake a forecasting exercise based on demographic predictions of the composition of U.S. households. In two separate scenarios, we assume the persistence of rents and prices and the lending conditions of 1990 to 2000 and 2000 to 2010, and we then assume a scenario of rising rents and prices to capture the possible impacts on homeownership of more recent trends in housing costs that may persist going forward. While it is not our base case, a set of circumstances exists under which the homeownership rate could fall below 50 percent.The first section of this article reviews the literature on recent historical trends in the homeownership rate in aggregate and by region and demographic category. The second section describes baseline scenarios for homeownership, starting with a framework put forth by Goodman, Pendall, and Zhu (2015) and developing that to forecast homeownership to 2050. The third section discusses how rising rent trends may affect the base cases. A final section concludes.Historical Changes in Homeownership, by Region and Demographic GroupAfter increasing from 44 to 62 percent between 1940 and 1960, the homeownership rate remained relatively stable through the 1990s (exhibit 1).2 It then increased from 64 to 69 percent between 1994 and 2004 and maintained that level until 2006 and fell back to 64 percent in 2009, declining to 63.4 percent in 2015.3 Both periods of stability and volatility are the outcomes of multiple and diverging demographic and economic forces. The literature on homeownership emphasizes both the role of demographic changes that occur over the long run and of market forces that can result in relatively fast adjustments (Fetter, 2013; Gabriel and Rosenthal, 2005, 2015; Goodman, Pendall, and Zhu, 2015; Green, 1996).Fetter (2013) provided evidence of the role of changes in the mortgage market in the rise in homeownership rate that occurred in the post-WWII period. This increase took place in part through households' accessing homeownership earlier in the lifecycle (exhibit 2) as shown by the shift from a linear to a concave relationship between age and the homeownership rate during that period. …",2016,2016-01-01,22,"{'Arthur Acolin', 'Laurie S.

Toward a Cross-Platform Framework: Assessing the Comprehensiveness of Online Rental Listings.,,"Research on rental housing markets in the United States has traditionally relied on national or local housing surveys. Those sources lack temporal and spatial specificity, limiting their use for tracking short-term changes in local markets. As rental housing ads have transitioned to digital spaces, a growing body of literature has utilized web scraping to analyze listing practices and variations in rental market dynamics. Those studies have primarily relied on one platform, Craigslist, as a source of data. Despite Craigslist's popularity, the authors contend that rental listings from various websites, rather than from individual ones, provide a more comprehensive picture. Using a mixed-methods approach to study listings across various platforms in five metropolitan areas, this article demonstrates considerable variation in both the types of rental units advertised and the features provided across those platforms. The article begins with an account of the birth and consolidation of online rental platforms and emergent characteristics of several selected websites, including the criteria for posting, search parameters, search results priority, and first-page search results. Visualizations are used to compare features such as the 40th percentile of rent, rent distribution, and bedroom size based on scraped data from six online platforms (Padmapper, Forrent.com, Trulia, Zillow, Craigslist, and GoSection8), 2020 Fair Market Rents, and 2019 American Community Survey data. The analyses indicate that online listing platforms target different audiences and offer distinct information on units within those market segments, resulting in markedly different estimates of local rental costs and unit size distribution depending on the platform.",2021,2021-01-01,4,"{'Arthur Acolin', 'Rebecca J.

In utero exposure to threat of evictions and preterm birth: Evidence from the United States,https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6773.13551,"To estimate county-level associations between in utero exposure to threatened evictions and preterm birth in the United States.Complete birth records were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics (2009-2016). Threatened evictions were measured at the county level using eviction case filing data obtained from The Eviction Lab (2008-2016). Additional economic and demographic data were obtained from the United States Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics.We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using 7.3 million births from 1,633 counties. We defined threatened eviction exposures as the z-score of average case filings over the pregnancy and by trimester. Our primary outcome was an indicator for preterm birth (born < 37 completed weeks of gestation). Secondary outcomes included a continuous measure for gestational length, a continuous measure for birth weight, and an indicator for low birth weight (born < 2500 g). We estimated within-county associations controlling for individual- and time-varying county-level characteristics, state-of-residence-year-and-month-of-conception fixed effects, and a county-specific time trend.We merged birth records with threatened eviction data at the county-month-year level using mother's county of residence at delivery and month-year of conception. We supplemented these data with information on county-level annual 18-and-over population, annual poverty rate, and monthly unemployment rate.Increased levels of eviction case filings over a pregnancy were associated with an increased risk of prematurity and low birth weight. These associations appeared to be sensitive to exposure in the second and third trimesters. Associations with secondary outcomes and within various population subgroups were, in general, imprecisely estimated.Higher exposure to eviction case filings within counties, particularly in the latter stages of a pregnancy, was associated with an increased risk of adverse birth outcomes.

Parental Perception of Flourishing in School-Aged Children: 2011–2012 National Survey of Children's Health,https://doi.org/10.1097/dbp.0000000000000559,"Flourishing reflects positive mental health and thriving and is important for children's development and well-being. Few national studies of flourishing among school-aged children exist. Exposure to socioeconomic disadvantage is negatively associated with social and health outcomes, including flourishing. This analysis describes independent associations of the child, family, school, and neighborhood factors with flourishing, which we hypothesized may contribute to sociodemographic disparities.Data from the 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health were used to examine parental perception of flourishing among school-aged children (6-17 years of age; n = 59,362). Flourishing was defined as curiosity about learning, resilience, and self-regulation. Unadjusted and adjusted associations between sociodemographic, child, family, school and neighborhood factors and flourishing were explored using χ tests and sequential logistic regression models.Overall, 48.4% of school-aged children were perceived by parents to be flourishing. There were significant sociodemographic disparities with non-Hispanic black children (37.4%) and those below the federal poverty level (37.9%) among the least likely to flourish. After adjustment, sex, race/ethnicity, parent education, child's age, physical activity, special health care needs status, adequate sleep, adverse childhood experiences, family meals, hours of television watched, extracurricular activities, school safety, neighborhood safety, neighborhood support, and presence of amenities were significantly associated with flourishing (p < 0.05). Disparities by poverty level and household structure were no longer significant.Addressing factors associated with parent-perceived flourishing including child, family, school and neighborhood factors such as physical activity, adequate sleep, and school/neighborhood safety may promote flourishing and reduce disparities.",2018,2018-03-09,34,"{'Ashley H.

Prevalence and Variation of Developmental Screening and Surveillance in Early Childhood,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2018.1524,"Since 2001, the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended universal developmental screening and surveillance to promote early diagnosis and intervention and to improve the outcomes of children with developmental delays and disabilities.To examine the current prevalence and variation of developmental screening and surveillance of children by various sociodemographic, enabling, and health characteristics.This cross-sectional analysis of the Health Resources and Services Administration's 2016 National Survey of Children's Health-a nationally representative survey of US children completed between June 2016 and February 2017-examined 5668 randomly selected children 9 through 35 months of age whose parent or caregiver responded to the address-based survey by mail or via a website. All analyses were weighted to account for the probability of selection and nonresponse and to reflect population counts of all noninstitutionalized US children residing in housing units.Developmental screening was measured through a validated set of 3 items indicating receipt in the past year of parent-completed screening from a health care professional with age-appropriate content regarding language development and social behavior. Surveillance was determined by an item capturing verbal elicitation of developmental concerns by a health care professional.Of the estimated 9.0 million children aged 9 through 35 months, an estimated 30.4% (95% CI, 28.0%-33.0%) were reported by their parent or guardian to have received a parent-completed developmental screening and 37.1% (95% CI, 34.4%-39.8%) were reported to have received developmental surveillance from a health care professional in the past year. Characteristics associated with screening and/or surveillance that remained significant after adjustment included primary household language, family structure, household education, income, medical home, past-year preventive visit, child health status, and special health care needs. Having health care that meets medical home criteria was significantly associated with both developmental screening (adjusted rate ratio, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.13-1.57) and surveillance (adjusted rate ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08-1.42), representing an 8 to 9 absolute percentage point increase. State-level differences spanned 40 percentage points for screening (17.2% in Mississippi and 58.8% in Oregon) and surveillance (19.1% in Mississippi and 60.8% in Oregon), with approximately 90% of variation not explained by child and family characteristics.Despite more than a decade of initiatives, rates of developmental screening and surveillance remain low. However, state-level variation indicates continued potential for improvement. Systems-level quality improvement efforts, building on the medical home, will be necessary to achieve recommended screening and surveillance goals.",2018,2018-07-09,159,"{'Christina Bethell', 'Veni Kandasamy', 'Colleen Reuland', 'Ashley H.

State and Local Government Expenditures and Infant Mortality,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2023-063571,"OBJECTIVES A previous study reported that increased state and local government expenditures were associated with decreased infant mortality rates (IMRs). However, reported estimates of the association between expenditures and IMR represented the degree to which the association changed each year, not the main effect. We reproduced the original results, reporting this main effect and replicated the analysis using improved methodology and updated data. METHODS For the reproduction analysis, we used methods and data identical to the original study: A publicly-posted, state-level data set of expenditures from 2000 to 2014 US Census Bureau survey data linked to 2-year lagged IMR data with a random intercept model including an interaction between time and expenditures. For the replication analysis, we added 5 years of data and adjusted for fixed state differences and inflation. RESULTS In the reproduction, the main effects of total, environmental, and educational expenditures on IMR were much larger than the interaction effects previously reported as the main effects. For example, a 1-SD increase in per-capita total expenditures was associated with a reduction of 0.35 infant deaths per 1000 live births instead of 0.02 deaths per 1000 live births originally reported. In the updated replication, the main effects were generally even larger (eg, −0.51 deaths per 1000 per SD increase in total expenditures). Increased total expenditures were associated with absolute but not relative reductions in Black–white IMR gaps. CONCLUSIONS State and local government expenditures are associated with greater reductions in IMR than previously reported, underscoring the importance of continued public investment.",2024,2024-11-06,1,"{'Ashley H.

Determining Gentrification’s Relationship to Birth Outcomes in Metropolitan California,https://doi.org/10.1080/10511482.2022.2125334,"There is inconsistent evidence whether gentrification, the increase of affluent residents moving into low-income neighborhoods, is detrimental to health. To date, there is no systematic evidence on how gentrification may matter for a range of birth outcomes across cities with varying characteristics. We utilize California's Birth Cohort File (2009–2012), decennial census data, and the American Community Survey (2008–2012) to investigate the relationship of gentrification to outcomes of preterm birth, low birth weight, and small for gestational age across California. We find that socioeconomic gentrification is uniformly associated with better birth outcomes. Notably, however, we find that only places specifically experiencing increases in non-White gentrification had this positive impact. These associations vary somewhat by maternal characteristics and by type of gentrification measure utilized; discrepancies between alternative measurement strategies are explored. This study provides evidence that socioeconomic gentrification is positively related to birth outcomes and that the race-ethnic character of gentrification matters, emphasizing the continued need to examine how gentrification may impact a range of health and social outcomes.",2022,2022-10-12,6,"{'Kyla Thomas', 'Audrey N.

I use U.S. Census Bureau micro-data and the passage of the Lender Liability Act as a novel identification strategy to answer this question. Firms increase on-site pollution, cut investment in abatement technology, and incur 17.54% more environmental regulatory violations when secured lenders become less responsible for the cleanup cost of their collateral. The effects are stronger for firms close to bankruptcy or with high environmental risks. This lower environmental compliance slightly benefits employment, but does not change wages or production. Overall, financial constraints that may be alleviated due to reduced lender liability do not result in pollution mitigation investment or increased production; instead, my findings suggest that reduced lender liability lessens banks’ incentives to influence the practices of their debtors.",2021,2021-01-01,3,{'Aymeric Bellon'},,"Law, Economics, and Judicial Systems; Insurance and Financial Risk Management; Housing Market and Economics",SSRN Electronic Journal,article,Aymeric Bellon,https://openalex.org/A5065231134,Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Boston

Employee entrepreneurship has a larger adverse impact on source firm performance than moves to established firms, even controlling for observable employee quality. Our findings suggest that in knowledge intensive settings, managers should focus on tailoring compensation packages to help minimize the adverse impact of employee entrepreneurship, particularly among high performing individuals.

In contrast, we find that inclusion of spinout team members from firms outside the founder's prior firm is positively associated with spinout failure, a relationship which becomes statistically insignificant when included team members' prior earnings are high. Taken together, our results point to the potential hazards associated with using external markets to assemble spinout teams, thereby establishing an important boundary condition for extant theory which has focused on the benefits associated with spinout team size, but has often neglected the labor market strategy through which such teams are assembled.",2020,2020-06-29,4,"{'Benjamin A.

Internal Vs External Markets: How The Assembly Of Initial Spin-Out Teams Impacts Spin-Out Survival,https://doi.org/10.5465/ambpp.2016.17556abstract,"Drawing on the knowledge-based view and labor market theory, we develop theory suggesting that a founder(s)’ use of internal versus external labor markets to assemble initial spin-out teams will have differential effects on spin- out survival.

Controlling for the size of the opportunity that the spin-out is exploiting (i.e., the initial client revenue), we find evidence that the use of internal labor markets to add spin-out team members from the founder(s)’ prior firm is beneficial for spin-out survival and that this effect increases with the added team members’ prior earnings.

Assessing the Impact of Differential Privacy on Measures of Population and Racial Residential Segregation,https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.5cd8024e,"The U.S. Census Bureau plans to use a new disclosure avoidance technique based on differential privacy to protect respondent confidentiality for the 2020 Decennial Census of Population and Housing.Their new technique injects noise based on a number of parameters into published statistics.While the noise injection does protect respondent confidentiality, it achieves the protection at the cost of less accurate data.To better understand the impact that differential privacy has on accuracy, we compare data from the complete-count 1940 Census with multiple differentially private versions of the same data set.We examine the absolute and relative accuracy of population counts in total and by race for multiple geographic levels, and we compare commonly used measures of residential segregation computed from these data sets.We find that accuracy varies by the global privacy-loss budget and the allocation of the privacy-loss budget to geographic levels (e.g., states, counties, enumeration district) and queries.For measures of segregation, we observe situations where the differentially private data indicate less segregation than the original data and situations where the differentially private data indicate more segregation than the original data.The sensitivity of accuracy to the overall global privacy-loss budget and its allocation highlight the fundamental importance of these policy decisions.Data producers like the U.S. Census Bureau must collaborate with users not only to determine the most useful set of parameters to receive allocations of the privacy-loss budget, but also to provide documentation and tools for users to gauge the reliability and validity of statistics from publicly released data products.If they do not, producers may create statistics that are unusable or misleading for the wide variety of use cases that rely on those statistics.",2022,2022-06-24,11,"{'David Van Riper', 'Jonathan Schroeder', 'Steven Ruggles', 'Tracy A.

Factors Affecting the Accuracy of Interviewer Observations: Evidence from the National Survey of Family Growth,https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nft016,"Interviewer observations of household characteristics can be useful variables for constructing post-survey nonresponse adjustments, particularly if the observations are good proxies of key variables collected later in the survey. The U.S. Census Bureau and other survey data-collection organizations now systematically design interviewer observations with this purpose in mind. However, because these observations are typically estimates or judgments made by the interviewers, they may be incorrect. The effectiveness of nonresponse adjustments using these observations is hampered by such errors. Thus, knowledge about both household- and interviewer-level factors that affect the accuracy of interviewer observations is important for survey researchers in their efforts to design interviewer observations. To date, only one published study of a face-to-face household survey has attempted to identify these factors. This paper attempts to help fill this gap in knowledge by presenting multilevel models of the accuracy of a housing-unit observation recorded by interviewers in the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG): whether or not young children under the age of 15 are present in the household. The presence of children in the household is an important correlate of key variables in the NSFG and many other socio-economic surveys, and is related to survey participation in general. The accuracy of this observation was found to be a function of selected household-level factors and interactions between household- and interviewer-level factors.

Severity matters: The moderating effect of offense severity in predicting racial differences in reporting of bias and nonbias victimization to the police.,https://doi.org/10.1037/lhb0000477,"Previous research has noted contradictory findings regarding race and police notification, such that Black people indicate higher levels of distrust in the police yet report victimization to the police at rates similar to or higher than others. We investigated the role of offense severity in accounting for these discrepancies.We hypothesized that severity would moderate racial differences in reporting, such that Black victims would be less likely to report less severe victimization but more likely to report more severe victimization. We expected that these differences would be less pronounced for bias-motivated crime, regardless of other markers of severity.We used data from the 2003-2016 National Crime Victimization Survey, including information on 21,510 victimization incidents, 1,105 of which were hate crimes. We conducted logistic regression analyses in which reporting was regressed on victim race, offense severity, hate crime status, and control variables. We also examined interactive effects to disentangle whether severity moderated racial differences in notification.We observed a three-way interaction of Black victims, offense severity, and hate crime status. Specifically, for nonbias incidents, Black victims were more likely than White victims to report severe incidents, but there was no racial difference in reporting nonsevere incidents. Additionally, for nonsevere incidents, Black victims were more likely than White victims to report hate crimes, but there was no racial difference in reporting nonhate crimes.Offense severity plays an important role in the victim decision-making process. These patterns are different, however, by race and for hate crime victims, suggesting that people perceive hate crimes as important to report, regardless of their severity.

Co-offending and police notification: the differential reporting of young groups to the police,https://doi.org/10.1080/1068316x.2022.2118748,"Despite a wealth of research on the decision to notify police following victimization, there has been relative inattention to the role of a basic feature of crime: the tendency for individuals to offend in groups. Following this, the current research examines the influence of co-offending on the decision to notify police using information from the National Crime Victimization Survey. Results indicate that the co-offending is significantly and positively related to the likelihood of notification. Findings further indicate that this relationship is moderated by co-offender characteristics, such that young co-offenders and, to a lesser extent, male co-offenders are more likely than their counterparts to be reported to police. These results have important implications for understanding the invocation of both formal social control and disparities in these processes, indicating that co-offending not only has a direct effect on notification, but that it also changes the effect of offender characteristics on this decision.",2022,2022-09-12,2,"{'Marin R.

A Comparative Efficiency Analysis of Cooperative and Non-cooperative Dairy Manufacturing Firms,,"Due to differences in ownership structure between cooperative and non-cooperative firms (NCFs), it has been hypothesized that co-ops may be less efficient than their non-cooperative counterparts. Illiquidity of owners’ investment and democratic governance may lead to underinvestment and managerial shirking in cooperative firms, both technical inefficiency sources, and the lack of a clear profit motive generates “inefficient” (relative to a profit-maximizing firm) economic decisions. This is especially true in the dairy product manufacturing sector, where production is capital intensive and factors leading to non-optimal investment decisions may have a large impact on efficiency. In this research we will use a unique dataset that includes plant level panel data for dairy product manufacturers from the Census of Manufactures encompassing the years 1977-2007 to determine whether there is a difference in plant level efficiency between cooperative firms and NCFs, as well as the source of any measured inefficiency.

The Nature of the Bias When Studying Only Linkable Person Records: Evidence from the American Community Survey,,"Record linkage across survey and administrative records sources can greatly enrich data and improve their quality. The linkage can reduce respondent burden and nonresponse follow-up costs. This is particularly important in an era of declining survey response rates and tight budgets. Record linkage also creates statistical bias, however. The U.S. Census Bureau links person records through its Person Identification Validation System (PVS), assigning each record a Protected Identification Key (PIK). It is not possible to reliably assign a PIK to every record, either due to insufficient identifying information or because the information does not uniquely match any of the administrative records used in the person validation process. Non-random ability to assign a PIK can potentially inject bias into statistics using linked data. This paper studies the nature of this bias using the 2009 and 2010 American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS is well-suited for this analysis, as it contains a rich set of person characteristics that can describe the bias. We estimate probit models for whether a record is assigned a PIK. The results suggest that young children, minorities, residents of group quarters, immigrants, recent movers, low-income individuals, and non-employed individuals are less likely to receive a PIK using 2009 ACS. Changes to the PVS process in 2010 significantly addressed the young children deficit, attenuated the other biases, and increased the validated records share from 88.1 to 92.6 percent (person-weighted).",2014,2014-01-01,27,"{'Brittany Bond', 'Adela Luque', 'J.

"Achieving the American Dream, Homeownership Wealth, and Voluntary Military Service: A Snapshot of Homeowners Who Transitioned to Adulthood During the First Gulf War",https://doi.org/10.21061/jvs.v10i1.544,"Since adopting the all-volunteer force in 1973, many young adults in the United States have viewed military service as a pathway to meet future life goals such as homeownership. I use a nationally representative survey, the American Community Survey (ACS), to examine a sample of homeowners who transitioned to adulthood during the first Gulf War and achieved their goal of paying off their mortgage and owning a single-family home. The data suggest an estimated one million of these homeowners (born between 1968 and 1973), including 30 thousand veterans. Even with their achievement, veteran homeownership is associated with lower home values than similar peers without military service. After controlling for demographic and housing characteristics, the comparisons show that the average differences in self-reported home values are ten percent lower than the comparison group. After reflecting on these findings and my decision to volunteer for the Marines in 1989, I find some encouraging news in the number of veterans who own a home without a mortgage and conclude that the average difference in home values would not have changed my decision to volunteer. However, throughout the project, I learned more about troubling social trends about trust in US institutions and recruiting challenges. I am concerned that these social trends—not differences in future homeownership wealth—may be the most menacing problem the US all-volunteer force has faced.",2024,2024-01-01,0,{'Brooks Depro'},Elon University,Political and Economic history of UK and US,Journal of Veterans Studies,article,Brooks M Depro,https://openalex.org/A5013627626,American Community Survey; Triangle RDC; FSRDC; American Community Survey Unedited Microdata; Decennial Census,American Community Survey,Triangle

Do Parents Matter for Student Loan Repayment after Graduation?,https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231211072683,"Previous studies suggest that a college degree is the great equalizer leveling the playing field. However, the rapidly growing educational debt of college graduates might restrict their life chances throughout adulthood, particularly for those raised in socioeconomically disadvantaged families. This study uses data from the National Survey of College Graduates to examine whether parents’ socioeconomic status is related to their children’s student loan repayment after graduation. Holding the amount borrowed for completing higher education constant, college graduates with less educated parents hold a larger amount of educational debt in adulthood compared with their counterparts with more educated parents. The association between family background and student loan repayment remains significant with the addition of controls for various covariates related to college graduates’ education, occupation, income, and other labor market outcomes. This study suggests that educational debt burdens imposed on individual college graduates limit the meritocratic power of higher education.",2022,2022-01-01,7,{'Byeongdon Oh'},Portland State University,"Higher Education Research Studies; Intergenerational and Educational Inequality Studies; Financial Literacy, Pension, Retirement Analysis",Socius Sociological Research for a Dynamic World,article,Byeongdon Oh,https://openalex.org/A5027696519,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS); National Survey of College Graduates; FSRDC; Census Bureau,National Survey of College Graduates,Berkeley
Changing Undergraduate Funding Mix and Graduate Degree Attainment,https://doi.org/10.1080/00221546.2023.2171210,"Previous studies of the role of college students' funding sources in their educational outcomes have focused on individual funding sources and have not paid much attention to the mixing of multiple sources. As rising college tuition has heightened the financial burden on college students, the use of multiple funding sources has become an adaptive funding strategy for completing a college degree. Using discrete funding-source information from the National Survey of College Graduates, this study offers the first exploration of the change in funding mixes across three cohorts — born in 1953–1962, 1963–1972, and 1973–1982 respectively — and their association with graduate degree attainment. The proportion of students who utilized only one or two funding sources decreased, while those who juggled three or more sources increased. Contrary to the oldest cohort, for whom the association between undergraduate funding mix and graduate degree attainment was relatively weak, in the recent cohort, students mobilizing multiple sources became less likely to obtain a graduate degree compared to those fully funded by their families.",2023,2023-01-31,2,"{'Byeongdon Oh', 'ChangHwan Kim'}","University of California, Berkeley; University of Kansas",Higher Education Research Studies; Higher Education Governance and Development; Intergenerational and Educational Inequality Studies,The Journal of Higher Education,article,Byeongdon Oh,https://openalex.org/A5027696519,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS); National Survey of College Graduates; FSRDC; Census Bureau,National Survey of College Graduates,Berkeley

On the Boundaries of Race,https://doi.org/10.1177/2332649216632546,"Socially constructed race groups have boundaries that define their membership. I study temporal trends and group-specific patterns in race and ancestry responses provided for children of interracial marriages. Common responses indicate contemporary definitions of race groups (and perhaps emerging groups); uncommon responses reveal socially defined limits of race group membership. I leverage dense, nonpublic, Census Bureau data from 1960 to 2010 to do this and include a more diverse set of families, a longer time span, and more accurate estimates than prior research. I find that the location of race group boundaries varies over time and across 11 distinct family types. Since mixed-heritage responses became possible in 1980, they have been common in most groups. Part Asians have almost always been reported as multiracial or mixed ancestry. A number of (non-Asian) mixed-heritage children are described as monoracial on the census form, particularly children with American Indian heritage. Over time, part whites are decreasingly reported as monoracially white (white race with no nonwhite ancestry). Black heritage is reported for part blacks, but monoracial black responses became nonmodal by 1980. Part Pacific Islanders show similarities to part Asians and part American Indians. Given the predominance of multiracial and mixed-ancestry Asian responses since 1980, Asian multiracial may be an emerging socially recognized race category. Black multiracial shows a similar pattern. Monoracial responses (especially common among white–American Indians and black–American Indians) create important but hard-to-measure complexity in groups’ compositions.",2016,2016-03-18,28,{'Carolyn A.

The Rise of Cohabitation in the United States: New Historical Estimates,,"1 The rise of cohabitation in the United States in the late twentieth century is an important component of the dramatic changes in marriage, family formation and childbearing (e.g., Bumpass, Sweet and Cherlin 1991; Bumpass and Lu 2000; Casper and Bianchi 2002; Manning 1995). This increase, first noted in the 1970s, was initially inferred from household composition because few data sources collected direct information on couples “living together” (Glick and Norton 1977, Glick and Spanier 1980). Research on cohabitation exploded in the 1980s as the trend accelerated and when longitudinal data sources, such as the National Survey of Families and Households, provided nationally representative datasets designed for studying cohabitation. Despite a wealth of new information on cohabitating couples—including the implications of cohabitation on family formation, relationship stability, childbearing and child well-being—there are few estimates of cohabitation that assess the dramatic change over time (e.g., Bumpass and Sweet 1989, Bumpass and Lu 2000). Studies that examine cross-sectional differentials, such as race, educational attainment and place of residence, are even rarer. This paper improves on previous attempts to infer cohabitation from the decennial census. The 1990 and 2000 censuses included specific responses for “unmarried partner” in the relationship question; previous censuses classified these individuals in broader “partner/roommate” or “partner/friend” categories. Our goal is to infer as best we can which individuals in the censuses of 1960 though 1980 would have described themselves as opposite-sex unmarried partners if that option had been available on the census. We do this by first developing rules to identify households that are likely contain an unmarried partner, and then by applying a regression model to refine these measures.",2005,2005-01-01,21,"{'Steven Ruggles', 'Catherine A Fitch', 'Ron Goeken'}",University of Minnesota System; Twin Cities Orthopedics,Family Dynamics and Relationships; Intergenerational Family Dynamics and Caregiving; Demographic Trends and Gender Preferences,,article,Catherine A Fitch,https://openalex.org/A5010780595,Decennial Census; FSRDC; Census Bureau; Minnesota RDC,Decennial Census,Minnesota
PLURAL - Place-level urban-rural indices for the United States from 1930 to 2018,https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.22596946,"<strong>PLURAL (Place-level urban-rural indices)</strong> is a framework to create continuous classifications of ""rurality"" or ""urbanness"" based on the spatial configuration of populated places. PLURAL makes use of the concept of ""remoteness"" to characterize the level of spatial isolation of a populated place with respect to its neighbors. There are two implementations of PLURAL, including (a) PLURAL-1, based on distances to the nearest places of user-specified population classes, and (b) PLURAL-2, based on neighborhood characterization derived from spatial networks. PLURAL requires simplistic input data, i.e., the coordinates (x,y) and population p of populated places (villages, towns, cities) in a given point in time. Due to its simplistic input, the PLURAL rural-urban classification scheme can be applied to historical data, as well as to data from data-scarce settings. Using the PLURAL framework, we created place-level rural-urban indices for the conterminous United States from 1930 to 2018. Rural-urban classifications are essential for analyzing geographic, demographic, environmental, and social processes across the rural-urban continuum. Most existing classifications are, however, only available at relatively aggregated spatial scales, such as at the county scale in the United States. The absence of rurality or urbanness measures at high spatial resolution poses significant problems when the process of interest is highly localized, as with the incorporation of rural towns and villages into encroaching metropolitan areas. Moreover, existing rural-urban classifications are often inconsistent over time, or require complex, multi-source input data (e.g., remote sensing observations or road network data), thus, prohibiting the longitudinal analysis of rural-urban dynamics. We developed a set of distance- and spatial-network-based methods for consistently estimating the remoteness and rurality of places at fine spatial resolution, over long periods of time. Based on these methods, we constructed indices of urbanness for 30,000 places in the United States from 1930 to 2018. We call these indices the place-level urban-rural index (PLURAL), enabling long-term, fine-grained analyses of urban and rural change in the United States. The method paper has been peer-reviewed and is published in ""Landscape and Urban Planning"". The PLURAL indices from 1930 to 2018 are available as CSV files, and as point-based geospatial vector data (.SHP). Moreover, we provide animated GIF files illustrating the spatio-temporal variation of the different variants of the PLURAL indices, illustrating the dynamics of the rural-urban continuum in the United States from 1930 to 2018. <strong>Apply the PLURAL rural-urban classification to your own data: </strong>Python code is fully open source and available at https://github.com/johannesuhl/plural. <strong>Data sources:</strong> Place-level population counts (1980-2010) and place locations 1930 - 2018 were obtained from IPUMS NHGIS, (University of Minnesota, www.nhgis.org; Manson et al. 2022).

Match Bias or Nonignorable Nonresponse? Improved Imputation and Administrative Data In the CPS Asec,https://doi.org/10.1093/jssam/smaa022,"Abstract We test an improved imputation technique, sequential regression multivariate imputation (SRMI), for the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement to address match bias. Furthermore, we augment the model with administrative tax data to test for nonignorable nonresponse. Using data from 2009, 2011, and 2013, we find that the current hot deck imputation used by the Census Bureau produces different distribution statistics, downward for poverty and inequality and upward for median income, relative to the SRMI model-based estimates. Our results suggest that these differences are a result of match bias, not nonignorable nonresponse. Nearly all poverty, median income, and inequality estimates are not significantly different when comparing imputation models with and without administrative data. However, there are clear efficiency gains from using administrative data.",2020,2020-07-21,2,"{'Charles Hokayem', 'Trivellore E.

Measuring Migration: Profiling Residential Mobility across Two Decades,https://doi.org/10.1177/193672440900300203,"The demography of a local population is a central aspect of applied social science research. Although birth and death rates influence a population, the key contributing factor influencing the demographics of a locality is almost always internal migration—the movement of persons between U.S. regions, states, and localities. Current definitions of internal migration used by the U.S. Census Bureau are limited because confidentiality restrictions require that detailed current and former place of residence geographic information be suppressed in publicly available files. In this paper we report the results of our work with confidential versions of the 1990 and 2000 decennial census microdata to develop an improved measurement of migration in order to develop a profile of internal migration in the United States. We perform our analysis for two contrasting time periods, 1985–1990 and 1995–2000. Our interest here is to assess the stability of the profile of migrants during a time period of economic contraction and expansion. Using confidential internal versions of the 1990 and 2000 Census long-form microdata, we estimate logistic models of the likelihood that individuals will migrate. The geographic detail in the internal Census data permits us to measure migration in ways that are not possible with public-domain Census data on persons. We develop migration definitions that distinguish between local residential mobility likely associated with life course transitions from migration out of the labor market area that may be driven more by employment and other socioeconomic considerations. Using logistic modeling, we find that the same individual attributes predict migration reasonably well during both periods.

Leaving Home: Modeling the Effect of Civic and Economic Structure on Individual Migration Patterns,,"This research analyzes the effect of community structure upon individuals' probabilities of moving between 1985 and 1990. Using the full Census sample long form microdata for 1990, we re-allocate adult persons in 1990 to their 1985 county of residence. Then, using origin county macro-structural variables (derived from the Economic Census microdata) and individual characteristics (from Decennial Census microdata), we develop a two level hierarchical linear model. In level 1, we construct a logistic equation modeling individual probabilities of moving. In level 2, we model the contextual effects of origin community structure on these models. These contextual effects fall into two categories: 1) economic conditions that comprise the usual aggregate 'push' factors and 2) civic community factors that act to retain people in their community. Results specify the relationship between community context and individual migration patterns, and demonstrate effects of local economic structure and local civic structure on these individual probabilities. Most notably, we find that civic attributes of communities are associated with a propensity to stay in place, net of community economic factors and individual characteristics.",2002,2002-06-01,4,"{'Michael D.

Focusing on nonmetropolitan American businesses, we connect restricted tabulations of the 2007 Survey of Business Owners to data on the commuting zones (CZ) in which businesses are located. We use multilevel logistic regression models to predict the effects of community bank presence within the CZ on the odds of using a bank business loan to start or expand a business for nonmetropolitan businesses started or purchased since 2000. Net of important characteristics of the businesses and owners, we find that the greater the proportion of local banks in a nonmetropolitan CZ, the greater the odds that a conventional business loan was used to either help start a new business or expand an existing business.",2017,2017-07-28,5,"{'Charles M.

This trend has fueled population growth in some nonmetropolitan areas and offset population decline in other areas. In this paper, we examine the implications of recent foreign born in‐migration for rural America. Our focus is on a collection of 59 nonmetropolitan counties where growth in foreign born stock offset declines in U.S. native population and resulted in increased local population by 2000. To understand these nonmetropolitan offset counties, we use confidential Census Bureau data that offer us the detailed geography and larger sample size needed to closely examine spatial shifts in the foreign born population, especially those recently arrived. Our findings illustrate dramatic compositional shifts in the populations of these areas, and suggest new demographic complexity in nonmetropolitan areas in the 21 st century.",2007,2007-11-22,80,"{'Alfred Nucci', 'Charles M.

A Comparative Efficiency Analysis of Cooperative and Non-cooperative Dairy Manufacturing Firms,,"Due to differences in ownership structure between cooperative and non-cooperative firms (NCFs), it has been hypothesized that co-ops may be less efficient than their non-cooperative counterparts.

We constructed a panel dataset merging data from the Minnesota Hospital Association, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Minneapolis Police Department, and American Community Survey. First, we specify an overall and racial subgroup autoregressive interrupted time-series design to identify the impact of the murder on rates of mental health hospital discharge at the city-level. We then examine the spatial heterogeneity in the impact of the murder by specifying zip code tabulation area (ZCTA)-level panel models. We find a 0.23 per 1,000 increase in mental health conditions among Black people in the immediate post-murder period, followed by a weekly decline (-.007) in mental health diagnoses. We do not find a substantial rate increase in White or Latine residents. Further, our analyses at the ZCTA-week-level corroborate these findings, while showing that the increase for Black residents was global.

Don't Quit Your Day Job: Using Wage and Salary Earnings to Support a New Business,,"This paper makes use of a newly constructed Census Bureau dataset that follows the universe of sole proprietors, employers and non-employers, over 10 years and links their transitions to their activity as employees earning wage and salary income. By combining administrative data on sole proprietors and their businesses with quarterly administrative data on wage and salary jobs held by the same individuals both preceding and concurrent with business startup, we create the unique opportunity to quantify significant workforce dynamics that have up to now remained unobserved. The data allow us to take a first glimpse at these business owners as they initiate business ventures and make the transition from wage and salary work to business ownership and back. We find that the barrier between wage and salary work and self-employment is extremely fluid, with large flows occurring in both directions. We also observe that a large fraction of business owners takeon both roles simultaneously and find that this labor market diversification does have implications for the success of the businesses these owners create. The results for employer transitions to exit and non-employer suggest that there is a ”don’t quit your day job” effect that is present for new businesses. Employers are more likely to stay employers if they have a wage and salary job in the year just prior to the transitions that we are tracking. It is especially important to have a stable wage and salary job but there is also evidence that higher earnings from the wage and salary job makes transition less likely. For nonemployers we find roughly similar patterns but there are some key differences. We find that having recent wage and salary income (and having higher earnings from such wage and salary activity) increases the likelihood of survival. Having recent stable wage and salary income decreases the likelihood of a complete exit but increases the likelihood of transiting to be an employer.

By combining administrative data on sole proprietors and their businesses with quarterly administrative data on wage and salary jobs held by the same individuals both preceding and concurrent with business startup, we create the unique opportunity to quantify significant workforce dynamics that have up to now remained unobserved. The data allow us to take a first glimpse at these business owners as they initiate business ventures and make the transition from wage and salary work to business ownership and back. We find that the barrier between wage and salary work and self-employment is extremely fluid, with large flows occurring in both directions. We also observe that a large fraction of business owners takeon both roles simultaneously and find that this labor market diversification does have implications for the success of the businesses these owners create. The results for employer transitions to exit and non-employer suggest that there is a ""don't quit your day job"" effect that is present for new businesses. Employers are more likely to stay employers if they have a wage and salary job in the year just prior to the transitions that we are tracking. It is especially important to have a stable wage and salary job but there is also evidence that higher earnings from the wage and salary job makes transition less likely. For nonemployers we find roughly similar patterns but there are some key differences. We find that having recent wage and salary income (and having higher earnings from such wage and salary activity) increases the likelihood of survival. Having recent stable wage and salary income decreases the likelihood of a complete exit but increases the likelihood of transiting to be an employer. Having recent wage and salary income in the same industry as the non-employer business has a large and positive impact on the likelihood of transiting to being a non-employer business.",2013,2013-01-01,5,"{'Christopher Goetz', 'Kristin Sandusky', 'John Haltiwanger', 'Mónica García-Pérez'}","St. Cloud State University; Government of the United States of America; National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA - Institute of Labor Economics; University of Maryland, College Park; Government of the United States of America",Firm Innovation and Growth; Labor market dynamics and wage inequality; Corporate Finance and Governance,SSRN Electronic Journal,article,Christopher F Goetz,https://openalex.org/A5074940212,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing; Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Philadelphia

FALLING HOUSE PRICES AND LABOR MOBILITY: EVIDENCE FROM MATCHED EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE DATA,,"This study uses worker-level employment data from the U.S. Census Bureau to test whether falling home prices affect a worker's propensity to take a job in a different metropolitan area from where he is currently located. Using a sample of workers from the American Community Survey, I employ a within-MSA-time estimation that compares homeowners to renters in their propensities to relocate for jobs according to data from the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics database. This strategy allows me to disentangle the influence of house prices from that of other time-varying, location-specific shocks. Estimates show that homeowners who have experienced declines in the nominal value of their home are approximately 20% less likely to take a new job in a location outside of the metropolitan area that they currently live and work in, relative to an equivalent renter. This evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that housing lock-in has contributed to the decreased labor mobility of homeowners during the recent housing bust.",2013,2013-08-01,0,{'Christopher Goetz'},,"Housing Market and Economics; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Housing, Finance, and Neoliberalism",RePEc: Research Papers in Economics,preprint,Christopher F Goetz,https://openalex.org/A5074940212,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing; Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Philadelphia

Measuring Underemployment at the County Level,,"As labor markets tightened in the last half of the nineties, economic development and community leaders sought to identify more locally available workers than were indicated by published statistics. Using results from commissioned surveys, they pointed to large numbers of part-time workers who desired full-time work, and to full-time workers who were qualified for better jobs. These statistics were often used to negate low official unemployment rates that deterred firms, concerned by the ostensible shortage of workers, from locating in their counties. We have conducted a larger, statewide, survey of underemployment and linked it to the detailed demographic and labor force data from the 2000 Census. We used the results to identify variations in the number and type of underemployed persons around the state, with emphasis on the differences between urbanized and rural areas. Over a quarter of full-time workers reported underemployment, including a third of workers in exurban counties. However, forty to fifty percent of underemployment is reportedly by choice, with the highest rates in the small urban and exurban regions. Of those that are not underemployed by choice, over ninety percent of respondents in some regions cited lack of job opportunities. We find that between fourteen and forty percent of part-time workers prefer full-time work, with the highest rates in rural Appalachian counties. We provide some of the reasons underemployed people cite as constraints to better employment. Also, we used the survey results and the recent Census information to predict the number and type of underemployed persons in each county. The model can be used to update predictions as new local demographic and labor force estimates are released annually from the Census Bureau’s forthcoming American Community Surveys.

County-level metrics of racial diversity and segregation computed from restricted-use U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey data were linked to a geolocated measure of sexual orientation implicit bias from over 825,000 respondents across the United States (2015–2021). Multilevel models revealed that living in more racially diverse counties was related to less stereotypic implicit associations of sexual orientation, and this relationship was moderated by racial segregation. This primary result was evaluated through a series of robustness checks. Weighted models accounting for the nonrepresentative nature of the sample revealed a robust association with diversity but not an interaction with segregation. The negative relationship with diversity was also replicated on a different Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit attitudes to disability, but the interaction with segregation was again insignificant. These results support the hypothesis that exposure to social diversity in one domain can generalize to intergroup attitudes in another domain.

The Long-run Economic Effects of School Desegregation,,"I estimate the effect of school desegregation on long-run economic outcomes by studying a natural experiment in Jefferson County, KY. In 1975, the district, under a court order, developed a unique busing assignment plan to merge the majority-white County district and the majority-black City district. Under this plan, students were assigned to be bused to new schools (versus stay at their home school and have new students bused in) based on their race and the first initial of their last name. Using this plausibly conditional random assignment and confidential data from the US Census Bureau, I find black students assigned busing to former County schools live in better neighborhoods (e.g. neighborhoods with higher tract-level income) at adulthood than black students assigned to remain in former City schools. This effect is strongest for students bused in earlier grades and is increasing in the total number of years a student is assigned busing. Busing assignment has small to zero effect on white students. I explore the implications of white disenrollment from the district (i.e. “white flight”) by using a novel dataset of archival yearbook records. These results suggest that school desegregation in this setting had positive long-run effects for black students by giving them access to better schools (e.g. schools with more capital investment, more credentialed teachers, lower drop-out rates, etc.).",2019,2019-09-28,6,{'Cody Tuttle'},"University of Maryland, College Park","School Choice and Performance; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Higher Education Research Studies",SSRN Electronic Journal,article,Cody Tuttle,https://openalex.org/A5049581802,Current Population Survey Voting and Registration Supplement; Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Chicago

The Structure of Material Hardship in U.S. Households: An Examination of the Coherence behind Common Measures of Well-Being,https://doi.org/10.1525/sp.2009.56.4.746,"Motivated by the growing interest in and the usage of measures of material hardship, together with the lack of a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the how indicators of material hardship relate to one another, we develop and test five conceptual models of the structural coherence of material hardship. While many previous analyses have relied on a unidimensional model of hardship, we argue that this is not conceptually and empirically sufficient. Instead, we compare the standard unidimensional account of hardship to a model that contrasts hardship related to physical necessities and hardship in less critical areas, two models contrasting hardships due to short-term constraints and those with longer time horizons, and finally, a model that posits each nominal type of hardship is best represented by its own latent construct. Using nationally representative data from the 2001 and 2004 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) (U.S. Census Bureau 2001, 2004), we estimate confirmatory factor analyses, which suggest that a model of hardship that separates different dimensions—health, food, bill paying, and housing hardship—fits this data better than any of the other conceptual models tested. This finding suggests strongly that the four aspects of material hardship modeled here, though obviously associated, are best understood as arising from processes and structures that are not identical.

Comparisons of administrative record rosters to census self-responses and NRFU household member responses1,https://doi.org/10.3233/sji-230048,"One of the U.S. Census Bureau’s innovations in the 2020 U.S. Census was the use of administrative records (AR) to create household rosters for enumerating some addresses when a response was not available but high-quality ARs were. The goal was to reduce the cost of the fieldwork in the Nonresponse Follow-up (NRFU). The original plan had NRFU beginning in mid-May and continuing through late July. However, the pandemic forced the delay of NRFU and caused the Internal Revenue Service to postpone the income tax filing deadline, resulting in an interruption in the delivery of ARs to the U.S. Census Bureau. The delays were not anticipated when U.S. Census Bureau staff conducted the research on AR enumeration with the 2010 Census data in preparation for the 2020 Census or during the fine tuning of plans for using ARs during the 2018 Census Test. These circumstances raised questions about whether the quality of the AR household rosters was high enough for use in enumeration. To aid in investigating the concern about the quality of the AR rosters, this study compares census rosters to AR rosters that meet a quality standard at addresses that have both and the census roster is either a self-response or a NRFU household member response. A key result is that the mode of census response and the amount of time between the response and the April 1 st reference date impacts the agreement rate between AR roster size and the census roster size at addresses that have both types of rosters.",2024,2024-02-01,0,"{'Mary H.

￼Promoting Family Economic Self-Sufficiency: The Impact of Head Start on Maternal ￼Human Capital Investment,,"It is widely believed that promoting employment among low-income families and, in particular, among low-income mothers may be one of most important social policies we have to combat poverty. One such program that relieves child-care costs and may potentially influence maternal employment is the Head Start program. Despite the large scale of the program, little is known as to how the Head Start subsidy may affect low-income mothers’ labor supply. In this work, I investigate the effect of Head Start participation on mothers’ labor supply, schooling, income, and welfare participation. I employ both experimental and quasi-experimental research designs using two sources of data that span 30 years of Head Start. In the first part of my analyses, I exploit the randomized experiment from the Head Start Impact Study (2002-2008) to examine how the availability of Head Start affect child care choices, maternal labor supply, and maternal schooling in recent years. In the second part of my analyses, I use the non-public decennial censuses of 1970 to investigate the effect of the Head Start program in its early years. I exploit a discontinuity in the county-level Head Start funding beginning in the late 1960s to explore differences in county-level maternal employment and maternal schooling. Overall, the findings from both data sources suggest that the availability of Head Start did not increase labor market entry. However, the availability facilitated full- time employment and school enrollment for some mothers in recent periods (i.e., early 2000s).",2015,2015-12-01,3,{'Cuiping Long'},,"Gender, Labor, and Family Dynamics; Work-Family Balance Challenges; Early Childhood Education and Development",,dissertation,Cuiping Long,https://openalex.org/A5060893145,Decennial Census; FSRDC; Chicago RDC; Census Bureau,Decennial Census,Chicago

PLURAL - Place-level urban-rural indices for the United States from 1930 to 2018,https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.22596946,"<strong>PLURAL (Place-level urban-rural indices)</strong> is a framework to create continuous classifications of ""rurality"" or ""urbanness"" based on the spatial configuration of populated places. PLURAL makes use of the concept of ""remoteness"" to characterize the level of spatial isolation of a populated place with respect to its neighbors. There are two implementations of PLURAL, including (a) PLURAL-1, based on distances to the nearest places of user-specified population classes, and (b) PLURAL-2, based on neighborhood characterization derived from spatial networks. PLURAL requires simplistic input data, i.e., the coordinates (x,y) and population p of populated places (villages, towns, cities) in a given point in time. Due to its simplistic input, the PLURAL rural-urban classification scheme can be applied to historical data, as well as to data from data-scarce settings. Using the PLURAL framework, we created place-level rural-urban indices for the conterminous United States from 1930 to 2018. Rural-urban classifications are essential for analyzing geographic, demographic, environmental, and social processes across the rural-urban continuum. Most existing classifications are, however, only available at relatively aggregated spatial scales, such as at the county scale in the United States. The absence of rurality or urbanness measures at high spatial resolution poses significant problems when the process of interest is highly localized, as with the incorporation of rural towns and villages into encroaching metropolitan areas. Moreover, existing rural-urban classifications are often inconsistent over time, or require complex, multi-source input data (e.g., remote sensing observations or road network data), thus, prohibiting the longitudinal analysis of rural-urban dynamics. We developed a set of distance- and spatial-network-based methods for consistently estimating the remoteness and rurality of places at fine spatial resolution, over long periods of time. Based on these methods, we constructed indices of urbanness for 30,000 places in the United States from 1930 to 2018. We call these indices the place-level urban-rural index (PLURAL), enabling long-term, fine-grained analyses of urban and rural change in the United States. The method paper has been peer-reviewed and is published in ""Landscape and Urban Planning"". The PLURAL indices from 1930 to 2018 are available as CSV files, and as point-based geospatial vector data (.SHP). Moreover, we provide animated GIF files illustrating the spatio-temporal variation of the different variants of the PLURAL indices, illustrating the dynamics of the rural-urban continuum in the United States from 1930 to 2018. <strong>Apply the PLURAL rural-urban classification to your own data: </strong>Python code is fully open source and available at https://github.com/johannesuhl/plural. <strong>Data sources:</strong> Place-level population counts (1980-2010) and place locations 1930 - 2018 were obtained from IPUMS NHGIS, (University of Minnesota, www.nhgis.org; Manson et al. 2022).

We document that measurement error in the reporting of higher education is prevalent in Census data. Further, these errors violate models of classical measurement error in important ways. The level of education is consistently reported as higher than it is (errors are not mean 0), errors in the reporting of education are correlated with covariates that appear in earnings regressions, and errors in the reporting of education appear correlated with the error term in a model of earnings determination. Thus, neither well-known results on classical measurement error nor recent models of nonclassical measurement error are likely valid when using Census and CPS data.

Racial differences in the relationship between the receipt of informal financial support and social insurance,https://doi.org/10.1080/00346764.2023.2241431,"AbstractIn this paper, we examine the relationship between the reliance on informal financial support and social insurance programs such as unemployment insurance to meet financial hardships imposed during the economic downturn associated with COVID-19. We use the U.S. Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey to compare the likelihood of receiving informal financial support from family and friends for households that did or did not receive social insurance controlling for observable household characteristics. We pay special attention to differences by race/ethnicity and by homeownership – a proxy for wealth. Our results suggest that (1) some types of social insurance receipt are a weak substitute for informal financial support, (2) the substitution between informal financial support and social insurance receipt is stronger among White households than households of color, and (3) wealth is a more consistent buffer against financial hardship than social insurance receipt.KEYWORDS: Race and ethnicitysocial insuranceinformal financial supportwealth gap Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.Data availability statementThe data that support the findings of this study are openly available at the U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey Data: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/datasets.html.

Our regression estimates are not materially different from the one based on the sample with imputed observations.3 The conclusions hold if we use other financial insecurity measures such as food insufficiency or being behind on rent or mortgage payments.4 The HPS is a household survey, but all statistics are reported using personal weight as is the case for public summary data tables based on U.S. Census Bureau (Citation2022). We use the term people and households interchangeably in this paper. The conclusions do not change if we use household weights instead of personal weights.5 Authors' calculations based on U.S. Census Bureau (Citation2022).6 All calculations in this paragraph based on Fed (2022). We combine data for 2020 and 2021 to have sufficiently large sample sizes by race and ethnicity. The combination of years of data does not impact our conclusions.7 We do not report the average share of people receiving EIP payments since that number is meaningless in repeated cross sections. Each household only received a one-time payment in the spring of 2021, unlike ongoing CTC or UI payments. A large share of households received EIP checks early in the spring, while some taxpayers waited well into the spring to get theirs. Taking an average across all recipients recorded in the HPS would indicate an artificially low share of people with such checks.8 Figure A1 in the appendix summarizes EIP receipt by HPS week, race and ethnicity. The share of Black and Latino recipients is generally larger than the share of White recipients across all weeks.9 Calculations based on the HPS show that 27.1 percent of homeowners saved their EIP checks, while 19.3 percent of renters did. Also, 33.7 percent of homeowners saved their CTC checks, while 18.2 percent of renters did. Authors calculations based on Census (Citation2022).10 Calculations based on Fed (2022). Correlations with other measures of access to liquid savings show similarly large gaps between renters and homeowners.11 In all instances, the parameter estimates for the other correlates are either statistically insignificant or have the expected sign.12 Combined effects are the exponentiated odds ratios of the sum of the two parameters or the product of the two odds ratios.13 This difference holds for all months in the first half of 2021, when data for EIP receipt are available.14 Authors' calculations based on Census (Citation2022).15 Authors' calculations based on Census (Citation2022)16 Authors' calculations based on Census (Citation2022).Additional informationNotes on contributorsDania V.

Dutch Disease or Agglomeration? The Local Economic Effects of Natural Resource Booms in Modern America,https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdx042,"Do natural resources benefit producer economies, or is there a ""Natural Resource Curse"", perhaps as the crowd-out of manufacturing productivity spillovers reduces long-term growth? We combine new data on oil and gas endowments with Census of Manufactures microdata to estimate how oil and gas booms affect local economies in the U.S. Local wages rise during oil and gas booms, but manufacturing is not crowded out—in fact, the sector grows overall, driven by upstream and locally-traded subsectors.

Are Anatomy PhDs Nearing Extinction or Adapting to Change? United States Graduate Education Trends in the Anatomical Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1002/ase.2013,"Faculty qualified to teach in the anatomical sciences are growing scarce just as the need for trained anatomists is greater than ever. Enrollments are surging in anticipation of a large physician shortfall; meanwhile, many anatomists are reaching retirement age. Who will fill the teaching gap? This study assessed trends in doctorates awarded in Anatomy and related fields within the United States (US) since 1969 and evaluated modern graduate education in the anatomical sciences. Data were compiled from the National Science Foundation Survey of Earned Doctorates. The total number of doctorates in the anatomical sciences and number of doctorates by sex and race/ethnicity were plotted for trend analysis. The number of PhD anatomy training programs within US medical schools was also assessed. Curricula and major characteristics of all active programs were evaluated through website searches and program director interviews. While doctorates in cell biology, developmental biology, and neuroscience have grown, the number of PhDs awarded in Anatomy has declined, on average, by 3.1 graduates per year to a 50-year low of only 8 graduates in 2017. Currently, 21 active doctoral programs in anatomy operate within US medical schools and fall into three general categories: anatomy education (n = 8), classic anatomy (n = 8), and anthropology/evolutionary anatomy (n = 5). Without a concerted effort by stakeholders to address the shortage, anatomists may face extinction. Expansion of the anatomy education doctoral degree may represent a necessary evolution of the field to meet job market needs and to thwart the extinction threat.",2020,2020-08-28,16,"{'Adam B.

Update on the state of the anatomy educator shortage,https://doi.org/10.1002/ase.2303,"Anatomy education is a cornerstone of health professions education. With the expansive growth of graduate and health professions programs, increased student enrollments, and the advancement of new medical techniques and technologies, the demand for anatomy education is robust. At the time of this editorial, within the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico there were 330 masters level nursing programs ((AACN) AAoCoN, n.d.), 329 speech-language pathology programs (CAA, n.d.), 300 physician assistant programs (ARC-PA, n.d.), 300 physical therapy programs (CAPTE, n.d.), 248 occupational therapy programs (ACOTE, n.d.), 198 osteopathic and allopathic medicine programs (LCME, n.d.; Association AO, n.d.), 70 dental medicine programs (CODA, n.d.), and 32 veterinary medicine programs (Association AVM, n.d.). Anatomy curricula, in some form, are common among these most popular health professions programs. However, with a limited supply of anatomy educators entering the workforce (Wilson et al., 2020, 2021; Edwards et al., 2022), hiring well-qualified individuals to teach the anatomical sciences is presently a challenge. The identified supply and demand mismatch has brought anatomy job market trends into the limelight and raises the question, “Are we, as a profession, equipped to meet the current and future needs of the health education market?” The anatomy educator shortage was first reported in 1961 when Eldred and Eldred observed an imbalance in teaching faculty as the number of medical schools expanded (Eldred & Eldred, 1961). In 2002, 41 years later, a national survey found that more than 80% of chairpersons anticipated difficulty in recruiting and hiring qualified anatomy educators (Holden, 2003). More recent reports, as of 2020, have explored the anatomy educator shortage from a variety of viewpoints including chairperson perspectives (Wilson et al., 2020), American Association for Anatomy (AAA) annual job posting outcomes (Wilson et al., 2020), National Science Foundation (NSF) outcomes from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (Wilson et al., 2021), and AAA membership retirement intentions (Edwards et al., 2022). Collectively, this information points to a continued and widening shortage of anatomy educators. Over the past seven years, from 2016 to 2022, AAA job postings for anatomy educators have increased by 60% at an average rate of six additional postings per year (Figure 1; R2 = 0.56). In 2022, the AAA job board hosted 128 openings for anatomy educator positions across US and Canadian medical, health professions, and undergraduate institutions (Figure 1). These 128 postings for anatomy educator positions were collated from a larger list of 184 AAA job postings. Duplicate postings were defined as postings for the same position, at the same institution, that were posted over multiple sequential time periods throughout the course of the year. Duplicate postings and positions for postdoctoral trainees, chairpersons, administrators, basic science researchers, clinical positions, or adjunct/part-time faculty were excluded from the analysis. Fewer job postings in 2020 were likely a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic (Edwards et al., 2022). The proportion of schools that have posted job openings consecutively from one year to the next has remained relatively constant over time and has not exceeded 25% of the total number of postings (Figure 2). As such, most job postings each year represented new/unique openings. The job advertisements posted across consecutive years predominately represented postings that first opened late in the calendar year (e.g., November) and lingered as unfilled positions into the next calendar year. Limited information in the AAA dataset prevented clear delineation between new versus lingering unfilled positions across consecutive years. Changes to the AAA job posting intake form are needed to yield a richer and more precise dataset. Additionally, a separate future analysis is needed to discern why certain schools take longer to fill their open positions than others, a possible byproduct of geographic characteristics, institutional factors, and the selectivity of searching anatomists (i.e., it is currently an employee's market). Based on job postings alone, the current market suggests a positive outlook for the future of the anatomy education job market. Previously, Wilson et al. reported a 5-year forecast, through 2025, regarding the number of PhD graduates expected to enter the workforce based on NSF data and the number of graduates that would be needed for the profession to reestablish a state of homeostasis (i.e., an equilibrium in the supply versus demand) (Wilson et al., 2021). Since this report, the number of PhD graduates reported by 62% (13 of 21) of active anatomy PhD programs has closely mirrored the projected estimate of 22 graduates per year (Figure 3). While 2023 is anticipated to yield at least 30 PhD anatomy graduates, these numbers (from 2020 to 2023; Figure 3) still fall short of the forecasted need of 40 to 51 graduates per year, through 2025. These forecasts did not account for faculty retirements, which now are estimated at approximately 40 per year, through at least 2026 (Edwards et al., 2022). Although job posting increases suggest a positive outlook for the profession, the trickling pipeline of anatomy PhD graduates entering the workforce is barely able to keep pace with faculty retirements, let alone fill the needs of new and expanding programs (Edwards et al., 2022). According to the NSF's Survey of Earned Doctorates dataset, over a three-year period, from 2019 to 2021, 20 different schools graduated at least one individual with a PhD in anatomy. The additional need to staff new programs, and existing programs with increased enrollments, will inevitably place further strain on the anatomy educator shortage. These outcomes suggest that within the foreseeable future, unless deliberate actions are taken and sustainable streams of financial support are identified, the supply of PhD-trained anatomists will continue to trail behind the growing health professions' demand for anatomy education. Without an adequate supply of anatomy educators, departments may come to rely more heavily on retirees, masters-trained individuals, and/or faculty from other related disciplines, which has the potential to increase demands for additional professional development (Wilson et al., 2018). While similar supply and demand misalignments may be occurring internationally, this dataset cannot be generalized to health education markets in other countries. The outcomes reported herein relied solely on the AAA job board. These numbers may be underestimates of the job market demand as they may not fully capture open positions posted through other sources. Future investigations that include data from additional job boards (e.g., American Association of Clinical Anatomists (AACA), Human Anatomy and Physiology Society (HAPS)) are needed to ensure a more comprehensive assessment of the anatomy education job market. Continued annual monitoring of the anatomy educator job market is necessary for identifying gaps and recognizing areas for improvement. However, simply tracking numbers without strategically developing and implementing a solution to reverse the shortage is not enough. To use an analogy, we must not allow a “threatened” species to become “endangered” without considering a need for intervention. To make a concerted effort to reverse the anatomy educator shortage will require input, cooperation, and coordination between anatomy PhD programs, departments, and professional associations. Instead of merely pontificating about the anatomy educator shortage, we must actively work to devise practical solutions to help turn the tide. Remaining idle at this critical juncture and failing to capitalize on our profession's unique growth opportunity will only result in stagnation within our community and perhaps a further loss of identity among anatomists.

In North Carolina, the Latino/a population more than doubled between 2000 and 2017. We examined fatal occupational injuries among Latino/a and non‐Latino/a workers in North Carolina over this period. Methods Information on fatal occupational injuries was abstracted from records of the North Carolina Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and the death certificate records held by the North Carolina Office of Vital Records. Estimates of the working population were derived from the decennial census and American Community Survey. Estimates of annual rates of fatal occupational injury for the period January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2017 were derived for Latino/a workers and compared to Black and White workers not identified as Latino/a. Results Over the study period, 1,783 fatal occupational injuries were identified among non‐Latino/a workers and 259 fatal occupational injuries among Latino/a workers in North Carolina. The majority of fatal occupational injuries among Latino/a workers occurred among males employed in construction and agriculture. While the fatal occupational injury rate among Latino/a workers declined over the study period, the rate among Latino/a workers was higher than among non‐Latino/a White and Black workers; moreover, fatal occupational injury rates for Latino/a workers trended upwards during the most recent years of the study period.

The effect of rate denominator source on US fatal occupational injury rate estimates,https://doi.org/10.1002/ajim.20057,"The Current Population Survey (CPS) is often used as a source of denominator information for analyses of US fatal occupational injury rates. However, given the relatively small sample size of the CPS, analyses that examine the cross-classification of occupation or industry with demographic or geographic characteristics will often produce highly imprecise rate estimates. The Decennial Census of Population provides an alternative source for rate denominator information. We investigate the comparability of fatal injury rates derived using these two sources of rate denominator information.Information on fatal occupational injuries that occurred between January 1, 1983 and December 31, 1994 was obtained from the National Traumatic Occupational Fatality surveillance system. Annual estimates of employment by occupation, industry, age, and sex were derived from the CPS, and by linear interpolation and extrapolation from the 1980 and 1990 Census of Population. Fatal injury rates derived using these denominator data were compared.Fatal injury rates calculated using Census-based denominator data were within 10% of rates calculated using CPS data for all major occupation groups except farming/forestry/fishing, for which the fatal injury rate calculated using Census-based denominator data was 24.69/100,000 worker-years and the rate calculated using CPS data was 19.97/100,000 worker-years. The choice of denominator data source had minimal influence on estimates of trends over calendar time in the fatal injury rates for most major occupation and industry groups.The Census offers a reasonable source for deriving fatal injury rate denominator data in situations where the CPS does not provide sufficiently precise data, although the Census may underestimate the population-at-risk in some industries as a consequence of seasonal variation in employment.",2004,2004-08-11,17,"{'A.

This paper reports the characteristics of sport and recreation-related (SR) emergency department (ED) visits among school-age children and youth in a statewide population.This study included all injury-related visits made to all North Carolina 24/7 acute-care civilian hospital-affiliated EDs by school-age youth, 5-18 years of age, during 2010-2014 (N = 918,662). Population estimates were based on US decennial census data. Poisson regression methods were used to estimate incidence rates and rate ratios.During the five-year period, there were 767,075 unintentional injury-related ED visits among school-age youth, of which 213,518 (27.8%) were identified as SR injuries. The average annual absolute number and incidence rate (IR) of SR ED visits among school-age youth was 42,704 and 2374.5 ED visits per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 2364.4-2384.6), respectively. In comparison to other unintentional injuries among school-age youth, SR ED visits were more likely to be diagnosed with an injury to the upper extremity (Injury Proportion Ratio [IPR] = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.27-1.29), the lower extremity (IPR = 1.14; 95% CI, 1.13-1.15), and a TBI or other head/neck/facial injury (IPR = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.11-1.13). Among ED visits made by school-age youth, the leading cause of SR injury was sports/athletics played as a group or team. The leading cause of team sports/athletics injury was American tackle football among boys and soccer among girls. The proportion of ED visits diagnosed with a TBI varied by age and sex, with 15-18 year-olds and boys having the highest population-based rates.Sports and recreational activities are an important component of a healthy lifestyle, but they are also a major source of injury morbidity among school-age youth.

Trends in fatal occupational injury rates among older workers before and after the Great Recession of 2008,https://doi.org/10.1136/oemed-2022-108587,"Background Older workers experience higher rates of fatal occupational injury than younger workers worldwide. In North Carolina, the population of older workers more than doubled between 2000 and 2017. In 2008, the Great Recession changed occupational patterns among all age groups. We examined annual rates and distribution of fatal occupational injuries experienced by older workers, comparing the pre-recession period (2000–2007) to the post-recession period (2009–2017). Methods Detailed information on all fatal occupational injuries during the period between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2017 were abstracted from the records of the North Carolina Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and the office of vital records. The decennial Census and American Community Survey were used to estimate the population at risk and derive annual rates of fatal occupational injury. Results During the study period, 537 occupational fatalities occurred among workers 55+ years of age. The rate of fatal occupational injury among older workers declined 2.8% per year, with a 7.7% yearly decline in the pre-recession period compared with a 1.4% increase per year in the post-recession period. Workers 65+ years of age experienced rate increases in both periods. The highest rates of unintentional fatal occupational injury (injuries that were not purposefully inflicted) were observed in forestry, fishing hunting and trapping, and wood building manufacturing.

Reducing Uncertainty in the American Community Survey through Data-Driven Regionalization,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0115626,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is the largest survey of US households and is the principal source for neighborhood scale information about the US population and economy. The ACS is used to allocate billions in federal spending and is a critical input to social scientific research in the US. However, estimates from the ACS can be highly unreliable. For example, in over 72% of census tracts, the estimated number of children under 5 in poverty has a margin of error greater than the estimate. Uncertainty of this magnitude complicates the use of social data in policy making, research, and governance. This article presents a heuristic spatial optimization algorithm that is capable of reducing the margins of error in survey data via the creation of new composite geographies, a process called regionalization. Regionalization is a complex combinatorial problem. Here rather than focusing on the technical aspects of regionalization we demonstrate how to use a purpose built open source regionalization algorithm to process survey data in order to reduce the margins of error to a user-specified threshold.",2015,2015-02-27,81,"{'Seth Spielman', 'David C.

Navigating Statistical Uncertainty: How Urban and Regional Planners Understand and Work With American Community Survey (ACS) Data for Guiding Policy,https://doi.org/10.1080/01944363.2018.1440182,"Problem, research strategy, and findings: The American Community Survey (ACS) is a crucial source of socio­demographic data for planners. Since ACS data are estimates rather than actual counts, they contain a degree of statistical uncertainty—referred to as margin of error (MOE)—that planners must navigate when using these data. The statistical uncertainty is magnified when one is working with data for small areas or subgroups of the population or cross-tabulating demographic characteristics. We interviewed (n = 7) and surveyed (n = 200) planners and find that many do not understand the statistical uncertainty in ACS data, find it difficult to communicate statistical uncertainty to stakeholders, and avoid reporting MOEs altogether. These practices may conflict with planners' ethical obligations under the AICP Code of Ethics to disclose information in a clear and direct way.Takeaway for practice: We argue that the planning academy should change its curriculum requirements and that the profession should improve professional development training to ensure planners understand data uncertainty and convey it to users. We suggest planners follow 5 guidelines when using ACS data: Report MOEs, indicate when they are not reporting MOEs, provide context for the level of statistical reliability, consider alternatives for reducing statistical uncertainty, and always conduct statistical tests when comparing ACS estimates.",2018,2018-04-03,22,"{'David C.

Uncertain Uncertainty: Spatial Variation in the Quality of American Community Survey Estimates,,"The U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) is the foundation of social science research, much federal resource allocation and the development of public policy and private sector decisions. However, the high uncertainty associated with some of the ACS’s most frequently used estimates can jeopardize the accuracy of inferences based on these data. While there is high level understanding in the research community that problems exist in the data, the sources and implications of these problems have been largely overlooked. Using 2006{2010 ACS median household income at the census tract scale as the test case (where a third of small-area estimates have higher than recommend errors), we explore the patterns in the uncertainty of ACS data. We consider various potential sources of uncertainty in the data, ranging from response level to geographic location to characteristics of the place. We nd that there exist systematic patterns in the uncertainty in both the spatial and attribute dimensions. Using a regression framework, we identify the factors that are most frequently correlated with the error at national, regional and metropolitan area scales, and nd these correlates are not consistent across the various locations tested. The implication is that data quality varies in dierent places, making cross-sectional analysis both within and across regions less reliable. We also present general advice for data users and potential solutions to the challenges identied.",2014,2014-11-07,12,"{'David C.

Patterns of Multidimensional Poverty in the United States,https://doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2023.2265984,"The accurate accounting of where and for whom deprivations occur is fundamental to addressing poverty. In the United States, the official poverty measure considers only a person's income, although poverty is increasingly understood internationally as a set of multiple, interlinked deprivations. This article introduces a decomposable multidimensional poverty (MDP) measure that addresses these shortcomings by using thirteen American Community Survey microdata indicators to identify education, health, housing, and economic security deprivations for individuals. In 2017, the national poverty rate was 13.7 percent when measured using MDP and 13.1 percent using official poverty. Although similar at the national scale, Hispanic, Asian, and older persons had higher poverty rates using the multidimensional measure, whereas Black and young persons had higher rates when using official poverty. MDP tended to be higher than official poverty in dense urban areas, whereas official poverty tended to be higher in rural areas. Further, MDP was a stronger correlate with COVID-19 death rates than official poverty through the first three waves of the pandemic. The design of MDP recognizes that individuals can experience poverty in different ways and provides a more holistic view of people and places.",2023,2023-11-06,2,"{'David C.

Who are the People in my Neighborhood?: The “Contextual Fallacy” of Measuring Individual Context with Census Geographies,https://doi.org/10.1111/gean.12192,"Scholars frequently use counts of populations aggregated into geographic units like census tracts to represent measures of neighborhood context. Decades of research confirm that variation in how individuals are aggregated into geographic units can dramatically alter analyses conducted with these units. While most researchers are aware of the problem, they have lacked the tools to determine its magnitude or its capacity to affect analytical results obtained using these contextual measures. Using confidential access to the complete 2010 U.S. Decennial Census, we can construct—for all persons in the U.S.—individual‐specific contexts, which we group according to Census‐assigned block, block group, and tract. We compare these individual‐specific measures to the published statistics at each scale, and we then determine the degree to which published measures could be affected by how boundaries are drawn using a simple statistic, the standard deviation of individual context (SDIC). For three key measures (percent Black, percent Hispanic, and Entropy—a measure of ethno‐racial diversity), we find that block‐level Census statistics frequently contain a high degree of uncertainty meaning that they may not capture the actual context of individuals within them. More problematic, we uncover systematic spatial patterns in the uncertainty associated with contextual variables at all three scales.",2019,2019-02-21,32,"{'David C.

The Financial Performance of Whole Company LBOs,,"Using the previously untapped Census Quarterly Financial Report (QFR) file, we explored the financial performance of a large unbiased sample of 209 leveraged buyouts (LBOs) and 48 going private transactions occurring between 1978 and 1989. Our principal findings are: First, we confirm previous work showing that LBOs substantially increase operating performance and reduce taxes. Second, we find that the operating performance gains are sustained for three years. However, there is a significant drop in performance in the fourth and fifth years. Performance in these years is not significantly above the pre- LBO level. Third, total debt to assets displays only a slight insignificant downward trend. Thus, high debt remains after the drop in performance. Fourth, we find evidence that the performance gains decline in the mid- to late 1980s, with the exception of 1989. Fifth, the data suggest that LBOs target typical firms. The only significant pre-LBO firm characteristic was lower bank debt relative to nonbank debt. Sixth, we identify a number of factors that differentiate LBO performance. Performance tends to be higher when pre-LBO performance is low and the firm is classified as a large R&D performer. Conversely, management buyouts and buyouts involving extensive restructuring did not outperform other buyouts. Finally, we observe a clear linkage between debt and performance, since nonleveraging going-private deals have significantly lower performance than LBOs.",1993,1993-11-01,36,"{'David J.

Age Discrimination Laws and Labor Market Efficiency,,"In Lazear's (1979) model of efficient long-term incentive contracts, employers impose involuntary retirement based on age. This model implies that age discrimination laws, which bar involuntary terminations based on age, discourage the use of such contracts and reduce efficiency. Alternatively, by making it costly for firms to dismiss older workers paid in excess of their marginal product, such laws may serve as precommitment devices that make credible the long-term commitment to workers that firms must make under Lazear contracts. Given that employers remain able to use financial incentives to induce retirement, age discrimination laws may instead strengthen the bonds between workers and firms and encourage efficient Lazear contracts. We assess evidence on these alternative interpretations of age discrimination laws by estimating the effects of such laws on the steepness of age-earnings profiles. If long-term incentive contracts are strengthened or become more prevalent, average age-earnings profiles should steepen for workers who enter the market after age discrimination laws are passed, and vice versa. The empirical analysis uses decennial Censuses of Population and state-level variation in age discrimination laws induced by state and federal legislation. The evidence indicates that age discrimination laws lead to steeper age-earnings profiles for cohorts entering the labor market, suggesting that these laws encourage the use of Lazear contracts, and increase efficiency.",1997,1997-07-01,13,"{'Wendy A.

Combining rules and discretion in economic development policy: Evidence on the impacts of the California Competes Tax Credit,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2022.104777,"We evaluate the effects of one of a new generation of economic development programs, the California Competes Tax Credit (CCTC), on local job creation. Incorporating perceived best practices from previous initiatives, the CCTC combines explicit eligibility thresholds with some discretion on the part of program officials to select tax credit recipients. The structure and implementation of the program facilitates rigorous evaluation. We exploit detailed data on accepted and rejected applicants to the CCTC, including information on the scoring of applicants with regard to program goals as well as on funding decisions, together with restricted-access American Community Survey (ACS) data on local economic conditions. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that each CCTC-incentivized job in a census tract increases the number of individuals working in that tract by close to 3 – a significant local multiplier. Local multipliers are larger for non-manufacturing awards than for manufacturing awards. CCTC awards increase employment among workers across socioeconomic groups and in more- as well as less-advantaged neighborhoods, but have limited impact on residents of affected communities.

Racial/Ethnic and Economic Segregation and Survival in the United States,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.21.20179721,"Abstract Life expectancy differences across racial/ethnic and economic groups persist in the U.S., but little is known about the combined effects of racial and income segregation in explaining old age survival across neighborhoods. We operationalized neighborhoods using census tracts, with 65,655 of them nested within 3,015 counties, nested within 49 states. We linked census track life table data for ages 45-74 (n=196,965) from the National Vital Statistics System with 5-year population estimates (2011-2015) stratified by race/ethnicity and income from the American Community Survey. We measured racial/ethnic and income segregation using the Index of Concentration of the Extremes at the census tract level, and the indexes of dissimilarity and exposure at the county level. Using three-level random intercept models, we assessed the direct and contextual relationship between survival at ages 45-74 with racial/ethnic and income segregation. Regardless of racial/ethnic stratification, a high concentration of neighborhood poverty was associated with a lower probability of survival relative to affluent neighborhoods (−4.83%; 95% CI −4.86, −4.79), although the relationship was larger in neighborhoods with high concentration of Blacks (−5.61%; −5.67, −5.54). Black-white county-level unevenness also had the largest negative association in those neighborhoods (−0.26%; −0.32, −0.20). Furthermore, Black isolation was negatively associated with a lower survival probability (−0.21%; −0.29, −0.13), but Hispanic isolation was positively associated (0.23%; 0.16, 0.30). Opposite relationships resulted from Black-White (0.06; −0.01, 0.14) and Hispanic-White (−0.13; −0.21, −0.05) interactions. Finally, high exposure to neighborhood poverty/affluence was associated with lower/higher probability of neighborhood survival, but the associations were the strongest for Blacks. Significance Racial/ethnic and income residential segregation have been associated with negative health outcomes and increased risk of mortality in the U.S. We tested the association between residential segregation at different geographic levels with the survival probability at ages 45-74 across rural/urban neighborhoods. Results indicate that the racial/ethnic and income geographic composition of the population are important factors for explaining this relationship. That is, poverty concentration, minority-white unevenness, and exposure to poverty, had detrimental outcomes for all communities, irrespective of their racial/ethnic composition. However, while minority-isolation/-exposure to whites is detrimental/protective for Black communities, the opposite happened in Hispanic communities. Our research provides important insights in understanding the extent to which residential segregation explains survival disparities across neighborhoods based on their race/ethnicity composition.",2020,2020-08-24,0,"{'Mark R.

Vulnerable Jobs and the Wage Effects of Import Competition,https://doi.org/10.1111/irel.12240,"Do job characteristics modulate the relationship between import competition and workers’ wages? Using pooled cross‐sectional, linked employee‐establishment Census Bureau microdata and O* NET occupational characteristics, the paper models import competition and wages for more than 1.6 million individuals, grouped by job vulnerability defined by routineness, analytic complexity, and interpersonal interaction. Results show import competition is associated with wages that are: lower in routine and less complex jobs; higher in nonroutine and complex jobs; and higher for the highest and lowest levels of interpersonal interaction. This demonstrates the importance of accounting for occupational characteristics in understanding how trade and wages relate.",2019,2019-06-10,1,"{'David L. Rigby', 'Abigail M.

The Role of Chance in the Census Bureau Database Reconstruction Experiment,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11113-021-09674-3,"Abstract The Census Bureau plans a new approach to disclosure control for the 2020 census that will add noise to every statistic the agency produces for places below the state level. The Bureau argues the new approach is needed because the confidentiality of census responses is threatened by “database reconstruction,” a technique for inferring individual-level responses from tabular data. The Census Bureau constructed hypothetical individual-level census responses from public 2010 tabular data and matched them to internal census records and to outside sources. The Census Bureau did not compare these results to a null model to demonstrate that their success in matching would not be expected by chance. This is analogous to conducting a clinical trial without a control group. We implement a simple simulation to assess how many matches would be expected by chance. We demonstrate that most matches reported by the Census Bureau experiment would be expected randomly. To extend the metaphor of the clinical trial, the treatment and the placebo produced similar outcomes. The database reconstruction experiment therefore fails to demonstrate a credible threat to confidentiality.",2021,2021-08-22,32,"{'David Van Riper', 'Steven Ruggles'}",University of Minnesota; University of Minnesota,Privacy-Preserving Technologies in Data; Housing Market and Economics; Census and Population Estimation,Population Research and Policy Review,article,David Van Riper,https://openalex.org/A5086899416,Minnesota RDC; Master Address File Extract; FSRDC; Address Control FIle; Decennial Census; Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Minnesota
Assessing the Impact of Differential Privacy on Measures of Population and Racial Residential Segregation,https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.5cd8024e,"The U.S. Census Bureau plans to use a new disclosure avoidance technique based on differential privacy to protect respondent confidentiality for the 2020 Decennial Census of Population and Housing.Their new technique injects noise based on a number of parameters into published statistics.While the noise injection does protect respondent confidentiality, it achieves the protection at the cost of less accurate data.To better understand the impact that differential privacy has on accuracy, we compare data from the complete-count 1940 Census with multiple differentially private versions of the same data set.We examine the absolute and relative accuracy of population counts in total and by race for multiple geographic levels, and we compare commonly used measures of residential segregation computed from these data sets.We find that accuracy varies by the global privacy-loss budget and the allocation of the privacy-loss budget to geographic levels (e.g., states, counties, enumeration district) and queries.For measures of segregation, we observe situations where the differentially private data indicate less segregation than the original data and situations where the differentially private data indicate more segregation than the original data.The sensitivity of accuracy to the overall global privacy-loss budget and its allocation highlight the fundamental importance of these policy decisions.Data producers like the U.S. Census Bureau must collaborate with users not only to determine the most useful set of parameters to receive allocations of the privacy-loss budget, but also to provide documentation and tools for users to gauge the reliability and validity of statistics from publicly released data products.If they do not, producers may create statistics that are unusable or misleading for the wide variety of use cases that rely on those statistics.",2022,2022-06-24,11,"{'David Van Riper', 'Jonathan Schroeder', 'Steven Ruggles', 'Tracy A.

The Going-Public Decision and the Product Market,https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhp098,"At what point in a firm's life should it go public? How do a firm's ex ante product market characteristics relate to its going-public decision? Further, what are the implications of a firm going public on its post-IPO operating and product market performance? In this article, we answer the above questions by conducting the first large sample study of the going-public decisions of U.S. firms in the literature. We use the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) of the U.S. Census Bureau, which covers the entire universe of private and public U.S. manufacturing firms. Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, a private firm's product market characteristics (total factor productivity [TFP], size, sales growth, market share, industry competitiveness, capital intensity, and cash flow riskiness) significantly affect its likelihood of going public after controlling for its access to private financing (venture capital or bank loans). Second, private firms facing less information asymmetry and those with projects that are cheaper for outsiders to evaluate are more likely to go public. Third, as more firms in an industry go public, the concentration of that industry increases in subsequent years. The above results are robust to controlling for the interactions between various product market and firm-specific variables. Fourth, IPOs of firms occur at the peak of their productivity cycle: the dynamics of TFP and sales growth exhibit an inverted U-shaped pattern, both in our univariate analysis and in our multivariate analysis using firms that remained private throughout as a benchmark. Finally, sales, capital expenditures, and other performance variables exhibit a consistently increasing pattern over the years before and after the IPO.

How Does Venture Capital Financing Improve Efficiency in Private Firms? A Look Beneath the Surface,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1025322,"We use the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) of the U.S. Census Bureau, which covers the entire universe of private and public U.S. manufacturing firms, to study several related questions regarding the efficiency gains generated by venture capital (VC) investment in private firms. First, do VCs indeed improve the efficiency (total factor productivity, TFP) of private firms, and if so, are certain kinds of VCs (high reputation vs. low reputation) better at generating such efficiency gains than others? Second, do VCs invest in more efficient firms to begin with (screening), or do they improve efficiency after investment (monitoring)? Third, do efficiency improvements due to VC backing arise from increases in sales or reductions in costs? Fourth, does VC backing and the associated efficiency gains affect the probability of a successful exit (IPO or acquisition)? Our analysis shows that the overall efficiency of VC-backed firms is higher than that of non-VC-backed firms at every point in time. This efficiency advantage of VC-backed firms arises from both screening and monitoring: the efficiency of VC-backed firms prior to receiving financing is higher than that of non-VC-backed firms, and further, the growth in efficiency subsequent to VC financing is greater for such firms. The above increases in efficiency of VC-backed firms are spread over the first two rounds of VC financing after which the TFP of such firms remains constant until exit. Additionally, we show that while the TFP of firms prior to receiving financing is lower for high-reputation VC-backed firms, the increase in TFP subsequent to financing is significantly greater for these firms, consistent with high-reputation VCs having greater monitoring ability. We disentangle the screening and monitoring effects of VC backing using three different methodologies: switching regression with endogenous switching, regression discontinuity analysis, and propensity score matching. We show that while overall efficiency gains generated by VC backing arise primarily from improvements in sales, the efficiency gains of high-reputation VC-backed firms arise also from lower increases in production costs.

The Effects of Corporate Spin-offs on Productivity,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.682505,"Using a unique sample of plant level data from the Longitudinal Research Database of the U.S. Census Bureau, which enables us to correctly identify the parent and spun-off entities prior to spin-offs, we establish that efficiency improves following spin-offs. A spin-off refers to the separation of the management of some assets of a firm into a separate entity (which we term as the spun-off entity or subsidiary). Using treatment effect estimators and propensity score matching in our analysis, we identify, how (the precise channel and mechanism), where (parent or subsidiary), and when (the dynamic pattern) efficiency improvements arise following spin-offs. We show that spin-offs increase total factor productivity (TFP) and that such productivity improvements are long-lived. This post spin-off productivity improvement can be attributed to cost savings but not to higher sales and arise primarily in plants remaining with the parent. However, contrary to speculation in the previous literature, we show that plants that are spun-off do not underperform parent plants prior to the spin-off. We identify acquisitions following spin-offs and find that while productivity improvements occur immediately after the spin-off in the non-acquired plants, in the acquired plants they start only after being taken over by another firm. Finally, we show that unrelated spun-off entities show greater improvements in productivity compared to related spun-off entities.",2009,2009-01-01,2,"{'Thomas J.

Zero-Inflated Modelling for Characterizing Coverage Errors of Extracts from the US Census Bureau's<i>Master Address File</i>,https://doi.org/10.1111/rssa.12183,"Summary To meet the strategic goals and objectives for the 2020 census, the US Census Bureau must make fundamental changes to the design, implementation and management of the decennial census. The changes must build on the successes and address the challenges of the previous censuses. Of particular interest is to gauge the on-going quality of the census frames. We address this topic by discussing a set of statistical models for the Master Address File that will produce estimates of coverage error at levels of geography down to the block level. The distributions of added and deleted housing units in a block are used to characterize the undercoverage and overcoverage respectively. The data used are from the 2010 address canvassing operation. As will be shown, these distributions are highly right skewed with a very large proportion of 0 counts. Hence, we utilize zero-inflated regression modelling to determine the predicted distribution of additions and deletions. In addition to standard statistical measures, we gauge the performance of this model by simulating a 2010 address canvassing operation using a specified coverage level.

A procedure for approximate negative binomial tolerance intervals,https://doi.org/10.1080/00949655.2012.715649,"AbstractIn this article, we present a procedure for approximate negative binomial tolerance intervals. We utilize an approach that has been well-studied to approximate tolerance intervals for the binomial and Poisson settings, which is based on the confidence interval for the parameter in the respective distribution. A simulation study is performed to assess the coverage probabilities and expected widths of the tolerance intervals. The simulation study also compares eight different confidence interval approaches for the negative binomial proportions. We recommend using those in practice that perform the best based on our simulation results. The method is also illustrated using two real data examples.Keywords: confidence intervalcoverage probabilityexpected widthfiducial inferenceinverse samplingsaddle-point approximationAMS Subject Classifications: 62D0562F25 AcknowledgementsWe thank an anonymous reviewer for helpful comments pertaining to this manuscript.Notes† Disclaimer: This report is released to inform interested parties of research, to encourage discussion.

Some dimension reduction strategies for the analysis of survey data,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40537-017-0103-6,"In the era of big data, researchers interested in developing statistical models are challenged with how to achieve parsimony. Usually, some sort of dimension reduction strategy is employed. Classic strategies are often in the form of traditional inference procedures, such as hypothesis testing; however, the increase in computing capabilities has led to the development of more sophisticated methods. In particular, sufficient dimension reduction has emerged as an area of broad and current interest. While these types of dimension reduction strategies have been employed for numerous data problems, they are scantly discussed in the context of analyzing survey data. This paper provides an overview of some classic and modern dimension reduction methods, followed by a discussion of how to use the transformed variables in the context of analyzing survey data. We highlight some of these methods with an analysis of health insurance coverage using the US Census Bureau's 2015 Planning Database.",2017,2017-12-01,26,"{'Jiaying Weng', 'Derek S.

Micro Data and Macro Technology,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2188988,"We study the implications of microeconomic heterogeneity for aggregate technology, showing that the aggregate elasticity of substitution between capital and labor can be expressed as a simple function of plant level structural parameters and sufficient statistics for plant heterogeneity. This allows for a new approach to estimating the aggregate elasticity using microeconomic data and allows us to examine how the aggregate elasticity varies over time or across countries. We then use plant level data from the Census of Manufactures to construct an aggregate elasticity of substitution for the manufacturing sector, and estimate an aggregate elasticity of approximately 0.72 in 1987. We find that the aggregate elasticity has risen over time in the US and is higher in less developed countries. These differences are quantitatively important; our estimates imply that a change in the interest rate has a 50 percent larger impact on India than the US.

How should we Define “Rural” when Investigating Rural Tobacco use in the United States?,https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2020.1856292,"Purpose: Investigations into rural tobacco-related disparities in the U.S. are hampered by the lack of a standardized approach for identifying the rurality-and, consequently, the urbanicity-of an area. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the most common urban/rural definitions (Census Bureau, OMB, RUCA, and Isolation) and determine which is preferable for explaining the geographic distribution of several tobacco-related outcomes (behavior, receiving a doctor's advice to quit, and support for secondhand smoke policies). Methods: Data came from The Current Population Survey Tobacco Use Supplement. For each tobacco-related outcome, one logistic regression was conducted for each urban/rural measure. Models were then ranked according to their ability to explain the data using Akaike information criterion (AIC). Results: Each definition provided very different estimates for the prevalence of the U.S. population that is considered ""rural"" (e.g., 5.9% for the OMB, 17.0% for the Census Bureau). The OMB definition was most sensitive at detecting urban/rural differences, followed by the Isolation scale. Both these measures use strict, less-inclusive criteria for what constitutes ""rural."" Conclusions: Overall, results demonstrate the heterogeneity across urban/rural measures. Although findings do not provide a definitive answer for which urban/rural definition is the best for examining rural tobacco use, they do suggest that the OMB and Isolation measures may be most sensitive to detecting many types of urban/rural tobacco-related disparities. Caveats and implications of these findings for rural tobacco use disparities research are discussed.

"Hispanic Disaster Preparedness in the United States, 2017: Examining the Association with Residential Characteristics.",,"The number of highly destructive disasters is increasing in regions of the United States where the Hispanic population is growing fastest. Up-to-date studies of disaster preparedness are needed that include housing measures and other factors that may account for differences in disaster preparedness between Hispanics and other racial and ethnic groups. This study fills this gap in the literature by using data from the 2017 American Housing Survey, which includes a topical module on disaster planning along with the core measures of housing and neighborhood characteristics, including housing tenure. The results reveal that Hispanics are generally less prepared than non-Hispanic Whites regarding resource- and action-based measures, with a few exceptions. Hispanics, Blacks, and Asians are significantly more likely than Whites to have at least 3 gallons of water per person, and Hispanics and Blacks are significantly more likely than Whites and Asians to have flood insurance. The findings show that housing and residential characteristics are consistently significant in predicting preparedness-controlling for other relevant variables-although they do not attenuate the disadvantages that Hispanics and Blacks face in their disaster preparedness relative to Whites. Future research would benefit from further exploration of the linkage between racial and ethnic inequalities in housing and neighborhood characteristics and household disaster preparedness.",2021,2021-01-01,4,"{'Samantha Friedman', 'Elizabeth Fussell', 'Recai Yucel', 'Mayuko Nakatsuka'}","University at Albany, State University of New York; John Brown University; University at Albany, State University of New York; Temple College; Temple University",Disaster Management and Resilience; Flood Risk Assessment and Management; Tropical and Extratropical Cyclones Research,PubMed,article,Elizabeth Fussell,https://openalex.org/A5020641779,BOC Best race and ethnicity administrative records file; American Community Survey; American Housing Survey,American Housing Survey,Boston
Differential Recovery Migration across the Rural–Urban Gradient: Minimal and Short‐Term Population Gains for Rural Disaster‐Affected Gulf Coast Counties,https://doi.org/10.1111/ruso.12305,"Abstract Places affected or threatened by extreme environmental disturbances confront a number of significant issues, including whether their populations will stay the same or change through migration. Research on Hurricanes Katrina and Rita shows some displaced residents returned to their disaster‐affected communities once the built environment was restored, new migrants settled in affected places as part of the rebuilding effort, and the regional migration system grew more urbanized and spatially concentrated during post‐disaster years. Research also shows that not all disaster‐affected places recovered their populations. Our study examines whether differential recovery is systematically patterned along the rural–urban gradient. Using U.S. Census Bureau estimates and IRS county‐to‐county migration data, we investigate whether the 2005 hurricane season differentially exacerbated or altered previous migration trends across a rural–urban gradient that incorporates proximity to metropolitan areas and disaster‐related housing loss. We find a rural–urban differential in Gulf Coast recovery migration: The disaster boosted migration among non‐metropolitan counties, yet these increases were smaller and short‐lived compared to the patterns found for metropolitan counties, most especially high loss metropolitan counties. Our findings encourage theories of environmental migration to incorporate spatial differentiation and scenarios of environmental changes to account for differential impacts on settlement patterns across the rural–urban continuum.",2019,2019-10-13,16,"{'Rachel A.

"The Increasing Effect of Neighborhood Racial Composition on Housing Values, 1980–2015",https://doi.org/10.1093/socpro/spaa033,"Abstract Beginning in the 1930s, neighborhood racial composition was an explicit determining factor in the evaluation of U.S. home values. This deliberate practice was outlawed in the 1960s and 1970s, but the correlation between neighborhood racial composition and home values persists. Using Census Bureau data from 1980 to 2015, the present study investigates the changing relationship between neighborhood racial composition and home appraisals, as well as the mechanisms that drive it. Contrary to what is often presumed, neighborhood racial composition was a stronger determinant of appraised values in 2015 than it was in 1980. Results suggest this is primarily due to contemporary appraising practices. Specifically, the use of the sales comparison approach has allowed historical racialized appraisals to influence contemporary values and appraisers’ racialized assumptions about neighborhoods to drive appraisal methods. These findings provide strong evidence that persistent racial inequality is driven in part by perpetual devaluing of communities of color and they suggest further regulation is required to foster equity.",2020,2020-06-12,114,"{'Junia Howell', 'Elizabeth Korver‐Glenn'}",University of Pittsburgh,"Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Housing Market and Economics",Social Problems,article,Elizabeth Korver-Glenn,https://openalex.org/A5031011735,Commercial CoreLogic Multiple Listing Services (MLS); Census Bureau; Rental Housing Finance Survey,Census Bureau,Penn State
Citizens But Not Americans: Race &amp; Belonging Among Latino Millennials,https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soy010,"The US Census Bureau recently announced that it will use the 2010 Census’s separate racial and ethnic category questions for the 2020 Census (Fontenot 2018),1 disregarding research indicating that a single, combined race/ethnicity question would provide more accurate population data. Though US Census racial and ethnic category decisions are not its main concern, Nilda Flores-González’s timely book Citizens But Not Americans offers crucial insight into how such a decision, if approved, would underscore Latino millennials’ sense of estrangement from their homeland by miscounting or misrepresenting them. By examining Latino millennials’ self-understandings of race and belonging, Flores-González contributes to ongoing debates concerning conceptual distinctions between race and ethnicity, the transformation of the US color line, and the ethnoracial dimensions of citizenship. To set the stage for these contributions, which emerged from a careful analysis of 97 in-depth interviews with second-, third-, and fourth-generation Latino millennials in the Chicago area, Flores-González first documents how this group experiences exclusion and discrimination in public spaces that continue to be racially segregated. While signals such as dark skin and Spanish language use subjected some youths to more intense experiences of discrimination, all youths experienced exclusion in public white spaces due to a shared Latin American ancestry that marked them as “not white.” These experiences contributed to youths’ self-understandings of their de jure inclusion but de facto exclusion from full participation in American life. The remainder of the book documents how these self-understandings were manifest in youths’ understandings of their ethnoracial identity, their “racial middle” position within the US racial hierarchy, and their strategies to recast themselves as “real” Americans.",2018,2018-02-13,0,{'Elizabeth Korver‐Glenn'},,"Racial and Ethnic Identity Research; Critical Race Theory in Education; Migration, Refugees, and Integration",Social Forces,article,Elizabeth Korver-Glenn,https://openalex.org/A5031011735,Commercial CoreLogic Multiple Listing Services (MLS); Census Bureau; Rental Housing Finance Survey,Census Bureau,Penn State
Business Dynamics on American Indian Reservations: Evidence from Longitudinal Datasets,,"We use confidential US Census Bureau data to analyze the difference in business establishment dynamics by geographic location on or off of American Indian reservations over the period of the Great Recession, and subsequent recovery (2007-2016). We geocoded U.S. Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Business Database, a dataset with records of all employer business establishments in the U.S. for location in an American Indian Reservation and used it to examine whether there are differences in business establishment survival rates over time by virtue of their location. We find that business establishments located on American Indian reservations have higher survival rates than establishments located in comparable counties. These results are particularly strong for the education, arts and entertainment, wholesale and retail, and public administration industries. While we are not fully able to explain this result, it is consistent with the business establishments being positively selected with respect to survival given the large obstacles necessary to start a business on a reservation in the first place. Alternatively, there may be certain safeguards in a reservation economy that protect business establishments from external economic shocks.",2020,2020-01-01,0,"{'Randall Akee', 'Elton Mykerezi', 'Richard M.

Automation and the Workforce: A Firm-Level View from the 2019 Annual Business Survey,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4282509,"This paper describes the adoption of automation technologies by US firms across all economic sectors by leveraging a new module introduced in the 2019 Annual Business Survey, conducted by the US Census Bureau in partnership with the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES). The module collects data from over 300,000 firms on the use of five advanced technologies: AI, robotics, dedicated equipment, specialized software, and cloud computing. The adoption of these technologies remains low (especially for AI and robotics), varies substantially across industries, and concentrates on large and young firms. However, because larger firms are much more likely to adopt them, 12-64% of US workers and 22-72% of manufacturing workers are exposed to these technologies. Firms report a variety of motivations for adoption, including automating tasks previously performed by labor. Consistent with the use of these technologies for automation, adopters have higher labor productivity and lower labor shares. In particular, the use of these technologies is associated with a 11.4% higher labor productivity, which accounts for 20-30% of the difference in labor productivity between large firms and the median firm in an industry. Adopters report that these technologies raised skill requirements and led to greater demand for skilled labor but brought limited or ambiguous effects to their employment levels.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",2022,2022-01-01,51,"{'Pascual Restrepo', 'Nikolas Zolas', 'David N.

Modeling Single Establishment Firm Returns to the 2007 Economic Census,,"The Economic Census is one of the most important activities that the U.S. Census Bureau performs. It is critical for updating firm ownership/structure and industry information for a large number of businesses in the Census Bureau’s Business Register, impacting most other economic programs. Also, it feeds into Bureau of Economic Analysis products, such as benchmark inputoutput accounts and Gross Domestic Product. The overall check-in rate for the 2007 Economic Census was just over 86%. Establishments owned by multi-location companies returned over 90% of their forms, as compared to the roughly two million single-establishment firms sampled in the Census that returned just over 80%. We model the check-in rate for single-establishment firms by using a large number of variables that might be correlated with whether or not a firm returns a form in the Economic Census. These variables are broadly categorized as the characteristics of firms, measures of external factors, and features of the survey design. We use the model for two purposes. First, by including many of the factors that may be correlated with returns we aim to focus limited advertising and outreach resources to low-return segments of the population. Second, we use the model to investigate the efficacy of an unplanned intervention expected to increase return rates: using certified mailing for one of the form follow-ups.",2011,2011-09-01,0,"{'Emin Dinlersoz', 'Shawn D.

Advanced Technologies Adoption and Use by U.S. Firms: Evidence from the Annual Business Survey,,"We introduce a new survey module intended to complement and expand research on the causes and consequences of advanced technology adoption. The 2018 Annual Business Survey (ABS), conducted by the Census Bureau in partnership with the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES), provides comprehensive and timely information on the diffusion among U.S. firms of advanced technologies including artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, robotics, and the digitization of business information. The 2018 ABS is a large, nationally representative sample of over 850,000 firms covering all private, nonfarm sectors of the economy. We describe the motivation for and development of the technology module in the ABS, as well as provide a first look at technology adoption and use patterns across firms and sectors. We find that digitization is quite widespread, as is some use of cloud computing. In contrast, advanced technology adoption is rare and generally skewed towards larger and older firms. Adoption patterns are consistent with a hierarchy of increasing technological sophistication, in which most firms that adopt AI or other advanced business technologies also use the other, more widely diffused technologies. Finally, while few firms are at the technology frontier, they tend to be large so technology exposure of the average worker is significantly higher. This new data will be available to qualified researchers on approved projects in the Federal Statistical Research Data Center network.",2020,2020-01-01,0,"{'Nikolas Zolas', 'David N.

Most research in this area has been limited to specific crime types (e.g., sexual assault), or it has not taken into account possible changes in the characteristics of incidents associated with police notification. In this article, we advance knowledge about long‐term trends in the reporting of crime to the police by using data from the National Crime Survey (NCS) and the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and methods that take into account possible changes in the factors that affect reporting at the individual and incident level as well as changes in survey methodology. Using data from 1973 to 2005, our findings show that significant increases have occurred in the likelihood of police notification for sexual assault crimes as well as for other forms of assault and that these increases were observed for violence against women and violence against men, stranger and nonstranger violence, as well as crimes experienced by members of different racial and ethnic groups. The reporting of property victimization (i.e., motor vehicle theft, burglary, and larceny) also increased across time. Overall, observed increases in crime reporting account for about half of the divergence between the NCVS and the Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR) in the estimated magnitude of the 1990s crime decline—a result that highlights the need to corroborate findings about crime trends from multiple data sources.",2010,2010-02-01,227,"{'Janet L.

"Immigrant status, citizenship, and victimization risk in the United States: New findings from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)*",https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-9125.12278,"Until recently, national-level data on criminal victimization in the United States did not include information on immigrant or citizenship status of respondents. This data-infrastructure limitation has hindered scientific understanding of whether immigrants are more or less likely than native-born Americans to be criminally victimized and how victimization may vary among immigrants of different statuses. We address these issues in the present study by using new data from the 2017-2018 National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) to explore the association between citizenship status and victimization risk in a nationally representative sample of households and persons aged 12 years and older. The research is guided by a theoretical framing that integrates insights from studies of citizenship with the literature on immigration and crime, as well as theories of victimization. We find that a person's foreign-born status (but not their acquired U.S. citizenship) confers protection against victimization. We also find that the protective benefit associated with being foreign-born does not extend to those with ambiguous citizenship status, who in our data exhibit attributes similar to the known characteristics of undocumented immigrants.

This issue is explored by comparing acquaintance robberies with the typical robbery involving strangers using NCVS data. The authors find that people who are Black, poor, young, and single are particularly vulnerable to acquaintance robbery. Their vulnerability is attributed to opportunity factors, and for youth, a reluctance to report incidents to the police.

How should we Define “Rural” when Investigating Rural Tobacco use in the United States?,https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2020.1856292,"Purpose: Investigations into rural tobacco-related disparities in the U.S. are hampered by the lack of a standardized approach for identifying the rurality-and, consequently, the urbanicity-of an area. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the most common urban/rural definitions (Census Bureau, OMB, RUCA, and Isolation) and determine which is preferable for explaining the geographic distribution of several tobacco-related outcomes (behavior, receiving a doctor's advice to quit, and support for secondhand smoke policies). Methods: Data came from The Current Population Survey Tobacco Use Supplement. For each tobacco-related outcome, one logistic regression was conducted for each urban/rural measure. Models were then ranked according to their ability to explain the data using Akaike information criterion (AIC). Results: Each definition provided very different estimates for the prevalence of the U.S. population that is considered ""rural"" (e.g., 5.9% for the OMB, 17.0% for the Census Bureau). The OMB definition was most sensitive at detecting urban/rural differences, followed by the Isolation scale. Both these measures use strict, less-inclusive criteria for what constitutes ""rural."" Conclusions: Overall, results demonstrate the heterogeneity across urban/rural measures. Although findings do not provide a definitive answer for which urban/rural definition is the best for examining rural tobacco use, they do suggest that the OMB and Isolation measures may be most sensitive to detecting many types of urban/rural tobacco-related disparities. Caveats and implications of these findings for rural tobacco use disparities research are discussed.

"Factors associated with attitudes toward U.S. immigration, 2004–2016",https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/nkry6,"This study investigates demographic, socioeconomic, political, and contextual factors associated with attitudes toward U.S. immigration. We analyze cross-sectional data from the 2004–2016 General Social Survey and American Community Survey five-year estimates. Results from generalized ordered logit models suggest that support to immigration has been increasing over time. There is no difference by sex on attitudes toward immigration. Non-whites, those between 18 and 24 years of age, people with higher educational attainment, and non-Protestants are more likely to be pro-immigration. People working on sales, office, natural resources, construction, maintenance, production, transportation, material moving, and military occupations are less likely to support immigration. People living in the South Atlantic region are the least likely to support an increase in immigration. People who lived in areas at the age of 16 that tend to have higher proportions of foreign-born individuals are more likely to support immigration. People who self-classify as strong Democrats, Independents near Democrats, and in other parties are more likely to be in favor of an increase on the number of immigrants. People with more liberal political views are more likely to be in favor of immigration. People with lower levels of racial resentment have higher chances to be in favor of an increase in immigration. Opinion about immigration has stronger associations with racial resentment than with opinion about U.S. economic achievement. People who live in counties with higher proportions of college graduates and higher proportions of immigrants are more likely to be pro-immigration.",2018,2018-08-08,2,"{'Ernesto F. L.

"Novel Healthcare Model, Continuation of Inequality: Exploring the Role of Micro Hospitals in Texas Healthcare Access Through Demographic Spatial Modeling",https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/ev6r2,"Purpose: Micro hospitals are a new form of for-profit healthcare facility with rapid expansion in some parts of the country. They continue to grow in Texas without in-depth public understanding or explicit policy guidance on their role in the healthcare system. Our project aims to define socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of areas served by micro and regular hospitals, and by doing so assess micro hospitals’ impact in expanding healthcare access for disadvantaged populations in Texas.Methodology/Approach: We 1) estimated hospital service areas (catchment areas) with a spatial model based on advanced Geographic Information System (GIS) methods using a proprietary ESRI traffic network; 2) assigned population socioeconomic measures to the catchment areas from the 2014–2018 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, weighted with an empirically tested Gaussian distribution; 3) used two-tailed t-tests to compare means of population characteristics between micro and regular hospital catchment areas, and 4) conducted logistic regressions to examine relationships between selected population variables and the associated odds of micro hospital presence.Findings: We found micro hospitals in Texas tend to serve a population less stressed in healthcare access compared to those who are more in need as measured by various dimensions of disadvantages.Research Limitations/Implications: Our analysis takes a cross sectional look at the population characteristics of micro hospital service areas. Even though the initial geographic choices of micro hospitals may not reflect the long-term population changes in specific neighborhoods, our analysis can provide policy makers a tool to examine healthcare access for disadvantaged populations at given point in time. As the population socioeconomic characteristics have long been associated with healthcare inequality, we hope our analysis will help foster structural policy considerations that balance growing healthcare delivery innovations and their social accountability.Originality/Value of Paper: We used GIS based spatial modeling to dynamically capture the potential patient basis by travel time calculated with a street network dataset rather than using the traditional static census tract to define hospital service areas. By mapping these boundaries in space we illustrated patterns that regression alone might not. Most importantly, by integrating both spatial and nonspatial dimensions of healthcare access, we demonstrated that the policy considerations on the implications of equal opportunity for healthcare access need to take into account the social realities for those experiencing the most vulnerability in our society, rather than a conceptual “equality” existing in the spatial and market abstraction.",2022,2022-09-15,0,"{'Ryan Earl', 'Ernesto F.

Lost Human Capital From Early-Onset Chronic Depression,https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.157.6.940,"OBJECTIVE: Chronic depression starts at an early age for many individuals and could affect their accumulation of ""human capital"" (i.e., education, higher amounts of which can broaden occupational choice and increase earnings potential). The authors examined the impact, by gender, of early- (before age 22) versus late-onset major depressive disorder on educational attainment. They also determined whether the efficacy and sustainability of antidepressant treatments and psychosocial outcomes vary by age at onset and quantified the impact of early- versus late-onset, as well as never-occurring, major depressive disorder on expected lifetime earnings.METHOD: The authors used logistic and multivariate regression methods to analyze data from a three-phase, multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial that compared sertraline and imipramine treatment of 531 patients with chronic depression aged 30 years and older. These data were integrated with U.S. Census Bureau data on 1995 earnings by age, educational attainment, and gender.RESULTS: Early-onset major depressive disorder adversely affected the educational attainment of women but not of men. No significant difference in treatment responsiveness by age at onset was observed after 12 weeks of acute treatment or, for subjects rated as having responded, after 76 weeks of maintenance treatment. A randomly selected 21-year-old woman with early-onset major depressive disorder in 1995 could expect future annual earnings that were 12%–18% lower than those of a randomly selected 21-year-old woman whose onset of major depressive disorder occurred after age 21 or not at all.CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset major depressive disorder causes substantial human capital loss, particularly for women. Detection and effective treatment of early-onset major depressive disorder may have substantial economic benefits.",2000,2000-06-01,243,"{'Stan N. Finkelstein', 'Susan G. Kornstein', 'Alan J.

The Impact of Information and Communication Technology Adoption on Multinational Firm Boundary Decisions,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2714322,"This paper evaluates the effect of adopting internet-enabled information and communication technology (ICT) adoption on the decision to reorganize production across national borders (foreign boundary decision) by multinational enterprises (MNE).

We propose that the heterogeneity in the technology’s characteristics, namely complexity and the production processes’ degree of codifiability, moderate this influence. Using a difference-in-differences methodology and exploiting the richness of confidential U.S. Census Bureau microdata, we find that overall ICT adoption is positively associated with greater likelihood of in-house production, as measured by increases in intra-firm trade shares. Furthermore, we find that more complex forms of ICT are associated with larger increases in intra-firm trade shares.

Entrepreneurial teams' acquisition of talent: a two-sided approach,,"While it is crucial for startups to hire high human capital employees, little is known about what drives the hiring decisions. Considering the stakes for both startups and their hires (i.e., joiners), we examine the phenomenon using a two-sided matching model that explicitly reveals the preferences of each side. We apply the model to a sample of startups from five technological manufacturing industries while examining a range of variables grounded in prior work on startup human capital. The analysis is based on the Longitudinal Employer Household dynamics from the U.S. Census Bureau. Our findings indicate that, in the context of entrepreneurship, both startups and joiners rely heavily on signals of quality. Further, quality considerations that are important for the match play a minimal role in determining earnings. Our approach refines our understanding of how entrepreneurial human capital evolves.",2016,2016-01-01,0,"{'Martin Ganco', 'Florence E M Honore'}",,Firm Innovation and Growth; Entrepreneurship Studies and Influences; Labor market dynamics and wage inequality,RePEc: Research Papers in Economics,preprint,Florence E Honore,https://openalex.org/A5038099408,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing; Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Wisconsin
How should we Define “Rural” when Investigating Rural Tobacco use in the United States?,https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2020.1856292,"Purpose: Investigations into rural tobacco-related disparities in the U.S. are hampered by the lack of a standardized approach for identifying the rurality-and, consequently, the urbanicity-of an area. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the most common urban/rural definitions (Census Bureau, OMB, RUCA, and Isolation) and determine which is preferable for explaining the geographic distribution of several tobacco-related outcomes (behavior, receiving a doctor's advice to quit, and support for secondhand smoke policies). Methods: Data came from The Current Population Survey Tobacco Use Supplement. For each tobacco-related outcome, one logistic regression was conducted for each urban/rural measure. Models were then ranked according to their ability to explain the data using Akaike information criterion (AIC). Results: Each definition provided very different estimates for the prevalence of the U.S. population that is considered ""rural"" (e.g., 5.9% for the OMB, 17.0% for the Census Bureau). The OMB definition was most sensitive at detecting urban/rural differences, followed by the Isolation scale. Both these measures use strict, less-inclusive criteria for what constitutes ""rural."" Conclusions: Overall, results demonstrate the heterogeneity across urban/rural measures. Although findings do not provide a definitive answer for which urban/rural definition is the best for examining rural tobacco use, they do suggest that the OMB and Isolation measures may be most sensitive to detecting many types of urban/rural tobacco-related disparities. Caveats and implications of these findings for rural tobacco use disparities research are discussed.

Validation of a New Continuous Geographic Isolation Scale: A Tool for Rural Health Disparities Research,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4928e,"The purpose of this study was to develop and test a new continuous measure for rural health disparities research to characterize geographic areas according to a perspective of access to resources. We call the measure Isolation and anticipate it will be useful as an alternative to commonly used rural classification schemes (e.g., the Census Bureau's measure). Following the best known standards for measuring rurality, it captures the trade-off between access to resource-rich, high-population-density areas and the cost of travel to those areas; thus even intrinsically low-resource areas may have high access to nearby resources. Validity was tested with proxies such as nighttime outdoor lights, distance to hospitals, physician availability, and access to high quality food. The Isolation scale demonstrated good construct validity (i.e., both convergent and criterion validity). Fit statistics indicated that, compared to other commonly-used urban/rural definitions, the Isolation scale was the best overall measure when predicting several proxies for rurality, even when categorized. We also show that the measure does a substantially better job at explaining national health outcome data at the state level. This new continuous Isolation scale shows considerable promise for improving our conceptualization, theorization, and measurement of the features of rurality that are pertinent to rural health disparities research, and can also be useful to policy makers who may find value in using isolation thresholds that are most relevant to their policy planning needs.",2017,2017-12-21,4,"{'Nathan Doogan', 'Megan E.

Measuring the Flow-Down of Injury Risks Along the Subcontracting Chain in the U.S. Construction Industry,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4844585,"Construction workers experience high rates of injury relative to other occupations. Previous research based on case/interview studies at the level of a craft or establishment and the statistical analysis of injuries across regions finds that subcontracting raises injury rates.

With these data, we assess how a contractor's position on the subcontracting chain and other establishment characteristics are associated with the number and likelihood of injuries on the job. Findings indicate that as work flows down subcontracting chains, that work is associated with higher rates of injury. Up-chain contractors can choose what scope of work they will keep on a project and what they will offload. This choice is the product of many considerations, one of which may be to disproportionately offload safety risks to lower-tier contractors.",2024,2024-01-01,0,"{'Kevin Conner', 'Mark J.

To account for time trends, I utilize a differences‐in‐differences approach with a control group of residents of Massachusetts who were already subject to a similarly regulated health insurance market. I find that the ACA's regulations caused an increase of 0.95 percentage points in health insurance coverage for my sample in 2014.

Modeling plant-level industrial energy demand with the Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey (MECS) database and the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD),https://doi.org/10.2172/10168855,"This report discusses Phase 1 of a project to help the US Department of Energy determine the applicability of the Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey (MECS) database and the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) for industrial modeling and analysis. Research was conducted at the US Bureau of the Census; disclosure of the MECS/LRD data used as a basis for this report was subject to the Bureau`s confidentiality restriction. The project is designed to examine the plant-level energy behavior of energy-intensive industries. In Phase 1, six industries at the four-digit standard industrial classification (SIC) level were studied. The utility of analyzing four-digit SIC samples at the plant level is mixed, but the plant-level structure of the MECS/LRD makes analyzing samples disaggregated below the four-digit level feasible, particularly when the MECS/LRD data are combined with trade association or other external data. When external data are used, the validity of using value of shipments as a measure of output for analyzing energy use can also be examined. Phase 1 results indicate that technical efficiency and the distribution of energy intensities vary significantly at the plant level. They also show that the six industries exhibit monopsony-like behavior; that is, energy prices vary significantly at the plant level, with lower prices being correlated with a higher level of energy consumption. Finally, they show to what degree selected energy-intensive products are manufactured outside their primary industry.",1992,1992-08-01,6,"{'Gale Boyd', 'M.J.

In response to this demand, statistical agencies such as the United States Census Bureau are making an effort to collect consistent and accurate data on same-sex partners. In this paper we discuss procedures used by the Census Bureau in collecting and reporting data on same-sex unmarried partners in the 2000 Decennial Census, highlighting a serious measurement error problem.

Also, among individuals in same-sex couples who did not finish high school, 43% are raising children, and 20% of children raised by same-sex couples live in poverty. The decrease in the proportion of couples raising children may be due to decreases in parenting by lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals who had children at a relatively young age while in a relationship with a different-sex partner. Declining social stigma toward LGB people may mean that more are coming out earlier in life and are becoming less likely to have children with different-sex partners. Despite the proportional declines in parenting, analyses also show that adoptive parenting is clearly increasing. Among couples with children, the proportion of same-sex couples who have adopted children has nearly doubled from 10% to 19% between 2000 and 2009. Despite the decline, the number of same-sex couples raising children is still much higher today than ten years ago since many more couples are reporting themselves in Census Bureau data. In 2000, the Census reported about 63,000 couples raising children. Today, the figure is now more than 110,000.",2012,2012-01-01,93,{'Gary J.

Cohabitation and Marriage Among Same-Sex Couples in the 2019 ACS and CPS: A Research Note,https://doi.org/10.1215/00703370-10181474,"Abstract Since the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that marriages of same-sex couples are legal in all states in the union, federal surveys have adapted to the shifting legal climate and included new measures that more directly identify same-sex and different-sex cohabiting and married couples. In this research note comparing the largest and most recent federal surveys—the 2019 American Community Survey and Current Population Survey—we find consistent levels of cohabitation and marriage across surveys. While the vast majority (90%) of different-sex couples were married, we report a more even split in cohabitation and marriage among same-sex couples. Our evaluation of sociodemographic characteristics of married and cohabiting couples indicates that differences were less prominent among same-sex couples than among different-sex couples, suggesting weaker sociodemographic selection into marriage among the former. However, factors affecting same-sex and different-sex couples' decisions to live together and marry may differ because of legal and social climates that still present unique obstacles for same-sex couples. Researchers need to acknowledge these differences in assessments of the implications of marriage for health and well-being.",2022,2022-09-19,10,"{'Gary J. Gates', 'Wendy D. Manning', 'Krista K.

Irish Men and Women in Same-Sex Partnerships in the United States,,"The Irish government has announced its intention to enact a civil partnership law that would for the first time offer formal legal recognition to same-sex couples in the Republic of Ireland. The 2006 Irish Census revealed that there were 2,090 same-sex cohabiting couples in the country. Analyses of data from the United States Census Bureau suggest these are not the only couples who might avail themselves of civil partnership: • More than 1,200 Irish-born men and women are living with a same-sex partner in the United States. • They are predominantly female and highly educated. One in seven reports raising children. • Civil partnership legislation could provide economic benefits to Ireland, enticing some of these talented same-sex couples to relocate back to Ireland and making the country more competitive in the global creative economy.",2008,2008-03-01,0,{'Gary J.

Family Formation and Raising Children Among Same-sex Couples - eScholarship,,"Proportionally fewer same-sex couples are raising children today than in 2006, and their families reflect greater racial/ethnic and socioeconomic diversity than often represented in the media and academic research. Notably, childrearing is substantially higher among racial/ethnic minorities. Also, among individuals in same-sex couples who did not finish high school, 43% are raising children, and 20% of children raised by same-sex couples live in poverty. The decrease in the proportion of couples raising children may be due to decreases in parenting by lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals who had children at a relatively young age while in a relationship with a different-sex partner. Declining social stigma toward LGB people may mean that more are coming out earlier in life and are becoming less likely to have children with different-sex partners. Despite the proportional declines in parenting, analyses also show that adoptive parenting is clearly increasing. Among couples with children, the proportion of same-sex couples who have adopted children has nearly doubled from 10% to 19% between 2000 and 2009. Despite the decline, the number of same-sex couples raising children is still much higher today than ten years ago since many more couples are reporting themselves in Census Bureau data. In 2000, the Census reported about 63,000 couples raising children. Today, the figure is now more than 110,000.",2012,2012-01-01,0,{'Gary J.

"Testimony: ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell""",,"Gates DADT Testimony: Page 1 of 3 Testimony on “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” by Gary J. Gates Friday, 18 July 2008 Submitted to: U.S. House of Representatives, Armed Services Committee, Military Personnel Subcommittee I am a demographer and Senior Research Fellow at the Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy, UCLA School of Law. Prior to taking my position at the Williams Institute three years ago, I served as a Research Associate at the Urban Institute in Washington, DC. I have studied the geographic, economic, and demographic characteristics of the lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) population for more than fifteen years and have a particular expertise in analyses of same-sex couples using data from the U.S. Census Bureau. As a demographer, I have a particular interest in counting people. Under the constraints of “Don’t Ask/Don’t Tell” (DADT), it is virtually impossible to easily enumerate LGB people currently serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. Because the policy clearly restricts military personnel from discussing their sexual orientation, it would be impossible to conduct a random survey of military personnel that asks them to reveal their sexual orientation. However, data from Census 2000 coupled with standard statistical methods provides a way to estimate the number of lesbian and gay individuals serving on active duty, in the ready reserve, and veterans. This was the focus of my research brief entitled “Gay Men and Lesbians in the Military: Estimates from Census 2000”. i A large body of research has shown that same-sex “unmarried partners” identified in the U.S. Census are primarily composed of lesbian and gay couples. The Census includes questions about both current and past military service. My estimates for the military service rates of LGB men and women are based on these responses and assume that the military service patterns of men and women in same-sex couples are the same as those for the entire LGB population. I should note that this likely provides a conservative estimate with regard to active duty service since it seems reasonable to assume that single gay men and lesbians would be more likely than their coupled counterparts to serve on active duty. This is true for heterosexual men and women and further, the constraints of",2008,2008-07-18,0,{'Gary J.

The Bright Side of Corporate Diversification: Evidence from Internal Labor Markets,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1787776,"We estimate the labor market consequences of corporate diversification using worker-firm matched data from the U.S. Census Bureau. We find evidence that workers in diversified firms have greater cross-industry mobility. Displaced workers experience significantly smaller losses when they move to a firm in a new industry in which their former firm alsooperates. We also find more active internal labor markets in diversified firms. Diversified firms exploit the option to redeploy workers internally from declining to expanding industries. Though diversified firms pay higher wages to retain workers, their labor is also more productive than focused firms of the same size, age, and industry. Overall, internal labor markets provide a bright side to corporate diversification.",2012,2012-01-01,9,"{'Yang Liu', 'Geoffrey A.

The Association between Immigration and Labor Market Outcomes in the United States,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2684246,"In this paper we present important correlations between immigration and labor market outcomes of native workers in the US. We use data on local labor markets, states and regions from the Census and American Community Survey over the period 1970-2010. We first look at simple correlations and then we use regression analysis with an increasing number of controls for observed and unobserved factors. We review the potential methods to separate the part of this correlation that captures the causal link from immigrants to native labor outcomes and we show estimates obtained with 2SLS method using the popular shift-share instrument.One fact emerging from all the specifications is that the net growth of immigrant labor has a zero to positive correlation with changes in native wages and native employment, in aggregate and by skill group.

The Determinants and the Selection of Mexico–US Migrants,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01425.x,"Abstract Using data from the Mexican Family Life Survey (MxFLS), a panel of Mexican individuals interviewed in 2002 and 2005, we analyse the characteristics of migrants from Mexico to the US relative to non‐migrants and those who migrated and subsequently returned to Mexico. Using pre‐ and post‐migration earnings and their earnings in the US from the American Community Survey (ACS), we characterise the selection of migrants on observable and non‐observable characteristics. Merging the data with US ACS data, we can also measure the expected earnings premium of migration to the US and the earnings premium for those that returned to Mexico. We find that migrants respond to the expected earnings premium to migration, once we control for migration costs. Also, the structure of the premium across skill groups generates negative selection on average and it can explain selection on observable and unobservables. We also find that returnees are more positively selected over skills than migrants to the US. Initial poverty, old age and family ties are strong deterrents of migration to the US, once we account for the skill‐specific migration premium. We also find a strong under‐representation of college educated among migrants to the US, possibly a consequence of the fact that undocumented migration is not an attractive option for those individuals.",2012,2012-02-01,75,"{'J.

Small Firm Financing Frictions: How Salient are they and what are their Real Effects? Review and Perspectives for New Research,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4052767,"We review the literature on the sources of financing and associated financing frictions facing small firms. Using data from the Survey of Business Owners, we first show that about half of small firms do not report using any external finance either for startup or for expansion. Among those that do, bank and credit card-based borrowing by the business and its owners account for the overwhelming share of external finance. Second, we highlight that there is growing evidence of heterogeneity in financing frictions facing small firms: a substantial share of firms may not even seek external finance or benefit from relaxed constraints because they do not wish to grow; on the other hand, relaxing constraints has large measured effects on investment and employment for certain sub-populations of small firms. This heterogeneity has important implications for how average effects are interpreted in academic studies, as well as for how policy is enacted. We conclude by noting the greater availability of micro data on small firm financing in recent years. This has the potential to generate substantial insight on the degree to which the rise of financial technology can overcome traditional financing frictions, as well as enhance our understanding of the effectiveness of different types of government interventions on small business financing and growth.",2022,2022-01-01,1,"{'Ramana Nanda', 'Gordon Phillips'}",Entrepreneurial Ecosystems; Harvard University; Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Corporate Finance and Governance; Private Equity and Venture Capital; FinTech, Crowdfunding, Digital Finance",SSRN Electronic Journal,article,Gordon M Phillips,https://openalex.org/A5068926411,Survey of Business Owners; LEHD Business Register Bridge (BRB) - 2008; Annual Business Survey,Survey of Business Owners,USC
Impact of in utero airborne lead exposure on long-run adult socio-economic outcomes: A population analysis using U.S. survey and administrative data,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0293443,"As a neurotoxin, early exposure to lead has long been assumed to affect socioeconomic outcomes well into adulthood. However, the empirical literature documenting such effects has been limited. This study documents the long-term effects of in utero exposure to air lead on adult socio-economic outcomes, including real earnings, disabilities, employment, public assistance, and education, using US survey and administrative data. Specifically, we match individuals in the 2000 US Decennial Census and 2001–2014 American Community Surveys to average lead concentrations in the individual’s birth county during his/her 9 months in utero . We then estimate the effects of shocks to airborne lead conditional on observable characteristics, county fixed effects, county-specific time trends, and month-year fixed effects. We find a 0.5 μg/m 3 decrease in air lead, representing the average 1975–85 change resulting from the passage of the U.S. Clean Air Act, is associated with an increase in earnings of 3.5%, or a present value, at birth, of $21,400 in lifetime earnings. Decomposing this effect, we find greater exposure to lead in utero is associated with an increase in disabilities in adulthood, an increase in receiving public assistance, and a decrease in employment. Looking at effects by sex, long-term effects for girls seem to fall on participation in the formal labor market, whereas for boys it appears to fall more on hours worked.

"Within-Couple Age Differences and Marital Sorting: Earnings, Ability and Appearance",,"This paper analyses how individual characteristics vary with within-couple age differences. Earnings analysis of prime-aged married couples in the 1970, 1980, 1990 and 2000 Decennial Censuses finds that male earnings decrease with within-couple age difference while female earnings increase with within-couple age difference. These patterns are true both for marriages in which the man is older and in which the woman is older. They are also robust across all four Census years. As an explanation for these patterns, we suggest that individuals typically prefer similarly aged spouses. Individuals who search and match outside similarly-aged partners therefore tend to be negatively selected. Women in differently-aged couples have higher earnings not because of positive selection, but because their effort increases in response to partnering with a lower earning man. We test whether there is negative selection into differently-aged couples using three measures: average earnings per hour in occupation using Census data, cognitive skills assessments from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort (NLSY79), and measures of physical appearance from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The point estimates suggest negative selection on all of these characteristics, although statistical significance varies by outcome and sample.",2011,2011-01-01,0,"{'Terra McKinnish', 'Hani Mansour'}",,"Family Dynamics and Relationships; Gender, Labor, and Family Dynamics; Intergenerational Family Dynamics and Caregiving",,article,Hani Mansour,https://openalex.org/A5043131125,American Community Survey Unedited Microdata; Decennial Census; LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) - 2014,Decennial Census,Colorado

Modeling Endogenous Mobility in Earnings Determination,https://doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2017.1356727,"We evaluate the bias from endogenous job mobility in fixed-effects estimates of worker- and firm-specific earnings heterogeneity using longitudinally linked employer–employee data from the LEHD infrastructure file system of the U.S. Census Bureau. First, we propose two new residual diagnostic tests of the assumption that mobility is exogenous to unmodeled determinants of earnings. Both tests reject exogenous mobility. We relax exogenous mobility by modeling the matched data as an evolving bipartite graph using a Bayesian latent-type framework. Our results suggest that allowing endogenous mobility increases the variation in earnings explained by individual heterogeneity and reduces the proportion due to employer and match effects. To assess external validity, we match our estimates of the wage components to out-of-sample estimates of revenue per worker. The mobility-bias-corrected estimates attribute much more of the variation in revenue per worker to variation in match quality and worker quality than the uncorrected estimates.

A Formal Test of Assortative Matching in the Labor Market,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1515695,"We estimate a structural model of job assignment in the presence of coordination frictions due to Shimer (2005). The coordination friction model places restrictions on the joint distribution of worker and firm effects from a linear decomposition of log labor earnings. These restrictions permit estimation of the unobservable ability and productivity differences between workers and their employers as well as the way workers sort into jobs on the basis of these unobservable factors. The estimation is performed on matched employer-employee data from the LEHD program of the U.S. Census Bureau. The estimated correlation between worker and firm effects from the earnings decomposition is close to zero, a finding that is often interpreted as evidence that there is no sorting by comparative advantage in the labor market. Our estimates suggest that this finding actually results from a lack of sufficient heterogeneity in the workforce and available jobs. Workers do sort into jobs on the basis of productive differences, but the effects of sorting are not visible because of the composition of workers and employers.",2009,2009-01-01,18,"{'John M.

"Home equity lending, credit constraints and small business in the US",https://doi.org/10.1111/ecin.13026,"Abstract We use Texas's constitutional amendment in 1997 that expanded the scope of home equity loans as a source of exogenous variation to estimate the effects of relaxing credit constraints on small businesses. We find, using standard panel data methods and restricted‐use microdata from the US Census Bureau, that the Texas amendment increased the use of home equity finance by small businesses, increased new business and job creation and reduced firm exit and job loss. The effects are larger and significant for businesses with fewer than 10 employees.",2021,2021-10-04,10,"{'Thor Watson', 'William D. Lastrapes', 'Ian M.

Modeling Endogenous Mobility in Wage Determiniation,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2627186,"We evaluate the bias from endogenous job mobility in fixed-effects estimates of worker- and firm-specific earnings heterogeneity using longitudinally linked employer-employee data from the LEHD infrastructure file system of the U.S. Census Bureau. First, we propose two new residual diagnostic tests of the assumption that mobility is exogenous to unmodeled determinants of earnings. Both tests reject exogenous mobility. We relax the exogenous mobility assumptions by modeling the evolution of the matched data as an evolving bipartite graph using a Bayesian latent class framework. Our results suggest that endogenous mobility biases estimated firm effects toward zero. To assess validity, we match our estimates of the wage components to out-of-sample estimates of revenue per worker.

An Interview with John M. Abowd,https://doi.org/10.1111/insr.12489,"Summary John M. Abowd is the Chief Scientist and Associate Director for Research and Methodology, US Census Bureau. He completed his AB in Economics at Notre Dame in 1973 and his PhD in Economics at University of Chicago in 1977 under Arnold Zellner. During his academic career, John has held faculty positions at Princeton, the University of Chicago, and, since 1987 at Cornell University where he is the Edmund Ezra Day Professor Emeritus of Economics, Statistics and Data Science. John was trained as a statistician and labor economist, and his economic research has focused on the rigorous empirical evaluation of labor market institutions. In the late 1990s, he began working with the Census Bureau on projects that would end up leveraging administrative and survey records into official statistical products. Through that work, he has developed a research agenda focused on issues necessary to generate those products, including data privacy, synthetic data, total error analysis, data linkage, and missing data problems, among others.",2022,2022-02-20,1,"{'Lars Vilhuber', 'Ian M.

A Formal Test of Assortative Matching in the Labor Market,,"We estimate a structural model of job assignment in the presence of coordination frictions due to Shimer (2005). The coordination friction model places restrictions on the joint distribution of worker and firm effects from a linear decomposition of log labor earnings. These restrictions permit estimation of the unobservable ability and productivity differences between workers and their employers as well as the way workers sort into jobs on the basis of these unobservable factors. The estimation is performed on matched employer-employee data from the LEHD program of the U.S. Census Bureau. The estimated correlation between worker and firm effects from the earnings decomposition is close to zero, a finding that is often interpreted as evidence that there is no sorting by comparative advantage in the labor market. Our estimates suggest that this finding actually results from a lack of sufficient heterogeneity in the workforce and available jobs. Workers do sort into jobs on the basis of productive differences, but the effects of sorting are not visible because of the composition of workers and employers.",2009,2009-01-01,1,"{'John M.

Proceedings from the 2017 Cornell-Census- NSF- Sloan Workshop on Practical Privacy,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3415585,"These proceedings report on a workshop hosted at the U.S. Census Bureau on May 8, 2017. Our purpose was to gather experts from various backgrounds together to continue discussing the development of formal privacy systems for Census Bureau data products. This workshop was a successor to a previous workshop held in October 2016 (Vilhuber & Schmutte 2017). At our prior workshop, we hosted computer scientists, survey statisticians, and economists, all of whom were experts in data privacy. At that time we discussed the practical implementation of cutting-edge methods for publishing data with formal, provable privacy guarantees, with a focus on applications to Census Bureau data products. The teams developing those applications were just starting out when our first workshop took place, and we spent our time brainstorming solutions to the various problems researchers were encountering, or anticipated encountering. For these cutting-edge formal privacy models, there had been very little effort in the academic literature to apply those methods in real-world settings with large, messy data. We therefore brought together an expanded group of specialists from academia and government who could shed light on technical challenges, subject matter challenges and address how data users might react to changes in data availability and publishing standards.In May 2017, we organized a follow-up workshop, which these proceedings report on. We reviewed progress made in four different areas. The four topics discussed as part of the workshop were 1. the 2020 Decennial Census; 2. the American Community Survey (ACS); 3. the 2017 Economic Census; 4. measuring the demand for privacy and for data quality.As in our earlier workshop, our goals were to 1. Discuss the specific challenges that have arisen in ongoing efforts to apply formal privacy models to Census data products by drawing together expertise of academic and governmental researchers; 2. Produce short written memos that summarize concrete suggestions for practical applications to specific Census Bureau priority areas.",2017,2017-01-01,0,"{'Lars Vilhuber', 'Ian M.

Disclosure Limitation and Confidentiality Protection in Linked Data,,"Confidentiality protection for linked administrative data is a combination of access modalities and statistical disclosure limitation. We review traditional statistical disclosure limitation methods and newer methods based on synthetic data, input noise infusion and formal privacy. We discuss how these methods are integrated with access modalities by providing three detailed examples. The first example is the linkages in the Health and Retirement Study to Social Security Administration data. The second example is the linkage of the Survey of Income and Program Participation to administrative data from the Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security Administration. The third example is the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data, which links state unemployment insurance records for workers and firms to a wide variety of censuses and surveys at the U.S. Census Bureau. For examples, we discuss access modalities, disclosure limitation methods, the effectiveness of those methods, and the resulting analytical validity. The final sections discuss recent advances in access modalities for linked administrative data.",2018,2018-01-01,0,"{'John M. Abowd', 'Lars Vilhuber', 'Ian M.

IT and Management in America,,"The Census Bureau recently conducted a survey of management practices in over 30,000 plants across the US, the first large-scale survey of management in America. Analyzing these data reveals several striking results. First, more structured management practices are tightly linked to higher levels of IT intensity in terms of a higher expenditure on IT and more on-line sales. Likewise, more structured management is strongly linked with superior performance: establishments adopting more structured practices for performance monitoring, target setting and incentives enjoy greater productivity and profitability, higher rates of innovation and faster employment growth. Second, there is a substantial dispersion of management practices across the establishments. We find that 18% of establishments have adopted at least 75% of these more structured management practices, while 27% of establishments adopted less than 50% of these. Third, more structured management practices are more likely to be found in establishments that export, who are larger (or are part of bigger firms), and have more educated employees. Establishments in the South and Midwest have more structured practices on average than those in the Northeast and West. Finally, we find adoption of structured management practices has increased between 2005 and 2010 for surviving establishments, particularly for those practices involving data collection and analysis.",2014,2014-02-17,8,"{'Itay Saporta‐Eksten', 'Megha Patnaik', 'Lucia Foster', 'John Van Reenen', 'Ron S.

"Technical Memorandum for Project 0871 ""Measuring the Impact of Trade on the U.S. Economy""",,"An increasingly important issue is the size and scope of trade in services. Official statistics report that services account for roughly one-third of U.S. exports in gross terms and recent papers constructing value-added trade statistics suggest that services account for more than half of U.S. exports on a value-added basis. A difficulty with measuring the services sector in general and trade in the services sector in particular is that service activities and delivery technologies are evolving rapidly. It remains an open question as to whether the U.S. statistical system broadly and the Census Bureau in particular are doing an effective job measuring trade in services. For example, the Census Bureau does collect export information from some service sectors, but not all. Project 0871 “Measuring the Impact of Trade on the U.S. Economy” developed methodology to produce estimates of trade costs for nearly every 6-digit NAICS code in scope for the Economic Census. The paper is currently in the peer review process, so the estimates are not considered final. This memorandum will use the current estimates for purposes of discussion, on the assumption that the current estimates will be close to the final estimates.",2018,2018-01-01,0,{'J.

Further, we demonstrate this crisis is regionally clustered, with the specific spatial pattern varying by the specific form of water hardship. Elevated levels of water hardship are associated with the social dimensions of rurality, poverty, indigeneity, education, and age-representing a nationwide environmental injustice.",2021,2021-06-22,162,"{'J.

The relationship between self-rated health and local government spending on parks and recreation in the United States from 1997 to 2012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2018.11.018,"The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between local government spending on parks and recreation and self-rated health in the United States. Using four publicly available datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Current Population Survey, the Decennial Census, the American Community Survey, and the State and Local Government Finance Survey for the years 1997-2012 (n = 303,203), we estimated a multinomial and a binary logit model predicting self-rated health with county area percentage of expenditures contributed to parks and recreation operations as the independent variable of interest. A one-percent increase in the portion of county area expenditures contributed to parks and recreation operations was associated with decreased relative risk of very good (RRR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.93, 0.96), good (RRR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.93, 0.97), or fair (RRR = 0.89; 95% CI = 0.87, 0.92) health relative to excellent health. The effect held in the binary logit model for adult men and women, but not youth. Higher levels of parks and recreation spending were associated with higher levels of self-rated health for adults across the United States from 1997 to 2012.

The relationship between parks and recreation per capita spending and mortality from 1980 to 2010: A fixed effects model,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2019.100827,"Evidence concerning the link between park access, use, programming and health has continued to grow. However, government funding for parks and recreation is highly susceptible to the ebbs and flows of the national economy. Given this, the purpose of this study was to test the relationship between county area spending on parks and recreation operations and all-cause mortality in the United States from the years 1980-2010. Using data from 1980 to 2010 collected from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, we analyzed the relationship between per capita county area spending on parks and recreation and county-level all-cause age-standardized female, male, and overall mortality using county and year fixed effects as well as relevant time-variant controls. The study was conducted during 2017 and 2018. County area spending on parks and recreation was negatively associated with overall and female-specific mortality from 1980 to 2010. According to our models for female and overall all-cause age-standardized mortality, when holding all else equal, a hundred-dollar increase in 2010 dollars in per capita parks and recreation operational expenditures was associated with an average decrease in morality of 3.9 and 3.4 deaths per 100,000, respectively. Although not commonly viewed as a form of healthcare spending, increased government funding for parks and recreation services had a significant association with decreased county level mortality. Our results suggest higher levels of per capita spending on parks and recreation may lead to lower levels of mortality.",2019,2019-02-10,12,"{'So Young Park', 'J. Tom Mueller', 'Andrew J.

The 2020 U.S. Census Differential Privacy Method Introduces Disproportionate Discrepancies for Rural and Non-White Populations,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/69mtk,"The recently finalized changes to the disclosure avoidance policies of the U.S. Census Bureau for the 2020 census, grounded in differential privacy, have faced increasing criticism from demographers and other social scientists. Scholars have found that estimates generated via Census-released test data are accurate for aggregate total population statistics of larger spatial units (e.g. counties), but introduce considerable discrepancies for estimates of subgroups. At present, the ramifications of this new approach remain unclear for rural populations. In this brief, we focus on rural populations and evaluate the ability of the finalized differential privacy algorithm to provide accurate population counts and growth rates from 2000 to 2010 across the rural-urban continuum for the total, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic or Latino/a, and non-Hispanic American Indian population. We find the method introduces significant discrepancies relative to the prior approach into counts and growth rate estimates at the county level for all groups except the total and non-Hispanic white population. Further, discrepancies increase dramatically as we move from urban to rural. Thus, the differential privacy method likely introduced significant discrepancies for rural and non-white populations into 2020 census tabulations.",2021,2021-06-03,2,"{'Alexis R. Santos‐Lozada', 'J.

"Cost of living variation, non-metropolitan America, and implications for the Supplemental Poverty Measure",https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6rax9,"Poverty scholarship in the United States is increasingly reliant upon the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) as opposed to the Official Poverty Measure of the United States for research and policy analysis. However, the SPM still faces several critiques from scholars focused on poverty of non-metropolitan areas. Key among these critiques is the geographic adjustment for cost of living employed in the SPM, which is based solely upon median rental costs and pools together all non-metropolitan counties within each state. Here, we evaluate the current geographic adjustment of the SPM using both microdata and aggregate data from the American Community Survey for 2014-2018. By comparing housing costs, tenure, and commuting, we determine median rent is likely an appropriate basis for geographic adjustment. However, by demonstrating the wide variability between median rents of non-metropolitan counties within the same state, we show that the current operationalization of this geographic adjustment is sorely lacking.",2021,2021-05-26,2,"{'José Pacas', 'Matthew M.

Burdened by renewable energy? A multi-scalar analysis of distributional justice and wind energy in the United States,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/enbd4,"The transition towards renewable energy is likely to be uneven across social and spatial dimensions. To ensure this transition is equitable and just, energy injustice has become the key framework for analyzing and interpreting the distribution of energy infrastructure. Wind energy development has experienced a significant gap between broad public support for increased development but persistent localized opposition to proposed projects, indicating that wind represents a locally unwanted land use. We argue that although the negative impacts of wind energy infrastructure are less extreme than those posed by other, more toxic, unwanted land uses, their status as a locally unwanted land use will produce similar distributional injustices as have been found throughout the environmental injustice literature. Using data from both the American Community Survey and the U.S. Wind Turbine Database, we use logistic and Poisson regressions, fixed effects, and temporal lags to evaluate the current landscape of wind energy injustice along the social dimensions of income, race and ethnicity, age, education, labor force participation, and rurality at three spatial scales: between all counties within the contiguous United States, between counties within states with wind energy, and between census tracts within counties with wind energy. We find results vary by scale and whether the model is comparing the presence of any development or the size of that development. The most evidence of injustice is visible at the within-county level related to whether or not there is any wind energy development, with few relationships present when evaluating the absolute size of development.",2019,2019-01-11,1,"{'Matthew M.

Differential Recovery Migration across the Rural–Urban Gradient: Minimal and Short‐Term Population Gains for Rural Disaster‐Affected Gulf Coast Counties,https://doi.org/10.1111/ruso.12305,"Abstract Places affected or threatened by extreme environmental disturbances confront a number of significant issues, including whether their populations will stay the same or change through migration. Research on Hurricanes Katrina and Rita shows some displaced residents returned to their disaster‐affected communities once the built environment was restored, new migrants settled in affected places as part of the rebuilding effort, and the regional migration system grew more urbanized and spatially concentrated during post‐disaster years. Research also shows that not all disaster‐affected places recovered their populations. Our study examines whether differential recovery is systematically patterned along the rural–urban gradient. Using U.S. Census Bureau estimates and IRS county‐to‐county migration data, we investigate whether the 2005 hurricane season differentially exacerbated or altered previous migration trends across a rural–urban gradient that incorporates proximity to metropolitan areas and disaster‐related housing loss. We find a rural–urban differential in Gulf Coast recovery migration: The disaster boosted migration among non‐metropolitan counties, yet these increases were smaller and short‐lived compared to the patterns found for metropolitan counties, most especially high loss metropolitan counties. Our findings encourage theories of environmental migration to incorporate spatial differentiation and scenarios of environmental changes to account for differential impacts on settlement patterns across the rural–urban continuum.",2019,2019-10-13,16,"{'Rachel A.

An Examination of the Medicaid Undercount in the Current Population Survey: Preliminary Results from Record Linking,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-6773.2008.00941.x,"To assess reasons why survey estimates of Medicaid enrollment are 43 percent lower than raw Medicaid program enrollment counts (i.e., ""Medicaid undercount"").Linked 2000-2002 Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS) and the 2001-2002 Current Population Survey (CPS).Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services provided the Census Bureau with its MSIS file. The Census Bureau linked the MSIS to the CPS data within its secure data analysis facilities.We analyzed how often Medicaid enrollees incorrectly answer the CPS health insurance item and imperfect concept alignment (e.g., inclusion in the MSIS of people who are not included in the CPS sample frame and people who were enrolled in Medicaid in more than one state during the year).The extent to which the Medicaid enrollee data were adjusted for imperfect concept alignment reduces the raw Medicaid undercount considerably (by 12 percentage points). However, survey response errors play an even larger role with 43 percent of Medicaid enrollees answering the CPS as though they were not enrolled and 17 percent reported being uninsured.The CPS is widely used for health policy analysis but is a poor measure of Medicaid enrollment at any time during the year because many people who are enrolled in Medicaid fail to report it and may be incorrectly coded as being uninsured.

Understanding The Current Population Survey's Insurance Estimates And The Medicaid ‘Undercount’,https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.28.6.w991,"The widely cited Census Bureau estimates of the number of uninsured people, based on the Current Population Survey, probably overstate the number of uninsured people.

Our study finds that the undercount can be explained by the inability of people to recall their insurance status accurately from the previous year.

Medicaid Under-reporting in the Current Population Survey and One Approach for a Partial Correction,,"Michael Davern, Jacob Alex Klerman and Jeanette Ziegenfuss REVISED: November 10, 2008 Survey estimates of public health insurance program enrollment tend to be lower than those compiled from administrative enrollment data for those same programs. This discordance is particularly apparent for Medicaid and has become known as the “Medicaid undercount”. The crude Medicaid undercount in the Current Population Survey’s Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS), the most prominently used survey for policy research that measures health insurance coverage, was 32 percent in both 2000 and 2001.ii Given the important uses of the CPS data, improved understanding of the undercount in the CPS is crucial. Towards that end, this paper reports preliminary results from an interagency project (funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Offices of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation) that involves researchers from the State Health Access Data Assistance Center (SHADAC), The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and the US Census Bureau (Census) (taking the first letter of each abbreviation lead to the acronym “SNACC”). This paper presents parameters from two logistic regression models. These parameters can be used to predict the probability that the Medicaid administrative data imply that a CPS sample member actually had Medicaid. We report the coefficients from two logistic regression models that can be used to adjust CPS responses towards their Medicaid status in the prior calendar year. Finally, we present a sample STATA program using the parameters and what we refer to as ʺpartially correctedʺ estimates of the number of uninsured Americans based on these parameters. With caveats we discuss below, these models will help researchers better understand the magnitude of the underlying survey response error, and their implications for policy research using the CPS.",2007,2007-10-21,11,"{'Jacob Alex Klerman', 'Jeanette Ziegenfussi', 'Michael Davern'}",,Healthcare Policy and Management; Health disparities and outcomes; Food Security and Health in Diverse Populations,,article,Jacob A Klerman,https://openalex.org/A5065722151,CPS Crosswalk; UCLA RDC; Medicaid Eligibility Database System - California; FSRDC; Census Bureau,Census Bureau,UCLA

We then examine CPS data linked to Medicaid enrollment data to estimate models of Medicaid reporting errors related to MMC.The Census Bureau linked administrative data on Medicaid enrollment to the CPS. Other data used were public use.We find similar results to a previous study using aggregate data that suggest that MMC worsens reporting of Medicaid enrollment.

This growth occurred because rural in-migration was larger than declines in the natural rate (the number of births compared with the number of deaths) of population growth. The rural population is also experiencing declines in poverty. In 2021, 9.7 percent fewer nonmetropolitan counties experienced persistent poverty (20 percent or more of the population had poverty level household incomes in each of the last four decennial Census years) compared with a decade earlier. Still, more than half of extremely low-income nonmetropolitan renter households experienced housing insecurity. This issue was particularly acute for American Indian or Alaska Native and Hispanic households. This report examines recent issues such as rural population and migration trends, poverty, housing insecurity, employment, and clean energy jobs.

Citizenship Reporting in the American Community Survey,https://doi.org/10.4054/demres.2013.29.1,"Citizenship status among the foreign born is a crucial indicator of social and political incorporation, yet there are good reasons to suspect that citizenship status is inaccurately reported on U.S. surveys.This paper updates research carried out in the mid-1990s by Passel and Clark (1997) on the extent to which foreign-born non-citizen respondents in U.S. government-sponsored surveys misreport as naturalized citizens.We compare demographic estimates of the resident naturalized foreign-born population in 2010, based on administrative data, to estimates from the 2010 American Community Survey (ACS).Similar to previous research, we find that misreporting in the ACS is especially high among immigrants from all countries/regions who report fewer than five years in the U.S. We also find that among longer-term foreign-born residents, misreporting is concentrated only among those originating in Mexico, especially men, a finding that diverges from Passel and Clark in that we find no evidence of over-reporting among immigrants from Central America and the Caribbean. Finally, the estimated magnitude of misreporting, especially among longer-term Mexican-born men, is sensitive to assumptions about the rate of emigration in our administrative-based demographic estimates, and assumptions about coverage error in the ACS, though altering these assumptions does not change the conclusions drawn from the general patterns of the results.For applications that use citizenship as an indicator of legal status, we recommend that self-reported data on citizenship be accepted at face value for all groups except those with less than five years of U.S. residence and Mexican men.",2013,2013-07-02,31,"{'James D.

Researchers use demographic methods to generate aggregated information about the number and demographic composition of the unauthorized immigrant population. But understanding their social and economic characteristics (e.g., educational attainment, occupations) often requires identifying likely unauthorized immigrants at the individual level. We describe a new method that pools data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), which identifies unauthorized immigrants, with data from the American Community Survey (ACS), which does not. This method treats unauthorized status as missing data to be imputed by multiple imputation techniques. Likely unauthorized immigrants in the ACS are identified based on similarities to self-reported unauthorized immigrants in the SIPP.

“WHITENESS” IN CONTEXT,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1742058x20000223,"Abstract Using data from the 2008–2016 American Community Survey, we compare the racial identification responses of the Mexican-origin population residing in California to their counterparts in Texas, the two states with the largest and most established Mexican-origin populations. We draw on existing theory and research in order to derive a theoretical account of state-level historical mechanisms that are likely to lead to varying patterns of racial identification within the two states and a set of propositions predicting the nature of this variation. Results indicate that the Mexican-origin population in Texas is substantially more likely to claim White racial identification than their counterparts in California, even after accounting for factors related to racial identity formation. Further analysis indicates that this result is robust and buffets the notion that the historical development of the racial context in Texas has engendered a present-day context in which “Whiteness” carries a distinctive social value, relative to California’s ethnoracial context, and that this social value is reflected in the ways in which individuals of Mexican origin respond to race questions on U.S. Census surveys.",2020,2020-01-01,1,"{'James D.

Predictors of Autism Spectrum Disorder and ADHD: Results from the National Survey of Children's Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2023.101512,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are two of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders with comorbidity rates of up to 70%. Population-based studies show differential rates of ADHD and ASD diagnosis based on sociodemographic variables. However, no studies to date have examined the role of sociodemographic factors on the likelihood of receiving an ADHD, ASD, or comorbid ASD+ADHD diagnosis in a large, nationally representative sample. This study aims to examine the impact of sociodemographic factors on the odds of experiencing ASD-only, ADHD-only, or both diagnoses for children in the United States. Using a mixed effects multinomial logistic modeling approach and data from the 2016-2018 National Survey of Children's Health, we estimated the association between sociodemographic variables and the log odds of being in each diagnostic group. Sociodemographic variables were differentially related to the three diagnostic groups: ASD-only, ADHD-only, and ASD+ADHD. Compared to girls, boys experienced higher odds of all three diagnosis categories. White children had higher odds of having an ADHD-only or ASD+ADHD diagnosis compared to Non-Hispanic (NH) Black, NH multiple/other race, and Hispanic children. Odds ratios for levels of parent education, household income, and birth characteristics showed varying trends across diagnostic groups. Overall, our findings point to unique sets of risk factors differentially associated ASD and ADHD, with lower income standing out as an important factor associated with receiving a diagnosis of ASD+ADHD.",2023,2023-08-02,10,"{'Jessica Bradshaw', 'Jan M.

Examining the association between rurality and positive childhood experiences among a national sample,https://doi.org/10.1111/jrh.12708,"Abstract Purpose The present study examines the association between rurality and positive childhood experiences (PCEs) among children and adolescents across all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Recent work has quantified the prevalence of PCEs at the national level, but these studies have been based on public use data files, which lack rurality information for 19 states. Methods Data for this cross‐sectional analysis were drawn from 2016 to 2018 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH), using the full data set with restricted geographic data (n = 63,000). Descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses were used to calculate proportions and unadjusted associations. Multivariable regression models were used to examine the association between residence and the PCEs that were significant in the bivariate analyses. Findings Rural children were more likely than urban children to be reported as having PCEs: volunteering in their community (aOR 1.29; 95% CI 1.18‐1.42), having a guiding mentor (aOR 1.75; 95% CI 1.45‐2.10), residing in a safe neighborhood (aOR 1.97; 95% CI 1.54‐2.53), and residing in a supportive neighborhood (aOR 1.10; 95% CI 1.01‐1.20) than urban children. Conclusions The assessment of rural‐urban differences in PCEs using the full NSCH is a unique opportunity to quantify exposure to PCEs. Given the higher baseline rate of PCEs in rural than urban children, programs to increase opportunities for PCEs in urban communities are warranted. Future research should delve further into whether these PCEs translate to better mental health outcomes in rural children.",2022,2022-08-27,8,"{'Janice C. Probst', 'Melinda A. Merrell', 'Jan M.

What Caused Racial Disparities in Particulate Exposure to Fall? New Evidence from the Clean Air Act and Satellite-Based Measures of Air Quality,,"Racial differences in exposure to ambient air pollution have declined significantly in the United States over the past 20 years. This project links restricted-access Census Bureau microdata to newly available, spatially continuous high resolution measures of ambient particulate pollution (PM2.5) to examine the underlying causes and consequences of differences in black-white pollution exposures. We begin by decomposing differences in pollution exposure into components explained by observable population characteristics (e.g., income) versus those that remain unexplained. We then use quantile regression methods to show that a significant portion of the unexplained convergence in black-white pollution exposure can be attributed to differential impacts of the Clean Air Act (CAA) in non-Hispanic African American and non-Hispanic white communities. Areas with larger black populations saw greater CAA-related declines in PM2.5 exposure. We show that the CAA has been the single largest contributor to racial convergence in PM2.5 pollution exposure in the U.S. since 2000, accounting for over 60 percent of the reduction.

Understanding Geographic Disparities in Mortality,https://doi.org/10.1215/00703370-10609710,"Abstract A rich literature shows that early-life conditions shape later-life outcomes, including health and migration events. However, analyses of geographic disparities in mortality outcomes focus almost exclusively on contemporaneously measured geographic place (e.g., state of residence at death), thereby potentially conflating the role of early-life conditions, migration patterns, and effects of destinations. We employ the newly available Mortality Disparities in American Communities data set, which links respondents in the 2008 American Community Survey to official death records, and estimate consequential differences based on the method of aggregation we use: the unweighted mean absolute deviation of the difference in life expectancy at age 50 measured by state of birth versus state of residence is 0.58 years for men and 0.40 years for women. These differences are also spatially clustered, and we show that regional inequality in life expectancy is higher based on life expectancies by state of birth, implying that interstate migration mitigates baseline geographic inequality in mortality outcomes. Finally, we assess how state-specific features of in-migration, out-migration, and nonmigration together shape measures of mortality disparities by state (of residence), further demonstrating the difficulty of clearly interpreting these widely used measures.",2023,2023-03-13,7,"{'Jahn K.

State of birth and cardiovascular disease mortality: Multilevel analyses of the National Longitudinal Mortality Study,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100875,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading contributor to mortality in the United States. Previous studies have linked early life individual and family factors, along with various contemporaneous place-based exposures to differential individual CVD mortality risk. However, the impacts of early life place exposures and how they compare to the effects of an individual's current place of residence on CVD mortality risk is not well understood. Using the National Longitudinal Mortality Study, this research examined the effects of both state of birth and state of residence on individual's risk of CVD mortality. We estimated individual mortality risk by estimating multi-level logistic regression models. We found that during a follow-up period of 11 years, 18,292 (4.2%) out of 433,345 participants died from CVD. The impact of state of birth on subsequent CVD mortality risk are greater than state of residence, even after adjusting for socio-demographic factors. Individuals who were born in certain states such as Tennessee, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania on average had higher CVD mortality risk. Conversely, those born in California, North Dakota, and Montana were found to have lower risk, no matter where they presently live. This study implies that early life state-level environments may be more prominent to individual's CVD mortality risk, compared to the state in which one lives. Future research should address specific mechanisms through which state of birth may affect people's risk of CVD mortality.",2021,2021-07-16,8,"{'Michael Topping', 'Wei Xu', 'Jason M.

Examining the long-term mortality effects of early health shocks,https://doi.org/10.1080/13504851.2018.1520960,"A growing literature in economics and other disciplines has tied exposure to early health shocks, particularly in utero influenza, to reductions in a variety of socioeconomic and health outcomes over the life course. However, less evidence exists that examines this health shock on mortality because of lack of available data. This paper uses recently released restricted-access files from the large, representative National Longitudinal Mortality Study in the United States to explore the mortality effects of the 1918 influenza pandemic for those in utero. While the results on socioeconomic outcomes mimic those in the literature, showing reductions in completed schooling and income fifty years following influenza exposure, the findings also suggest no effect on overall mortality or by categories of cause-of-death. These results are unexpected in their contrast with the many reported effects of in utero insults on later cardiovascular health as well as the literature linking education with later mortality.",2018,2018-09-27,12,{'Jason M.

Where and When: Sharpening the lens on geographic disparities in mortality,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2020.100680,"Life course theories suggest that geographic disparities in mortality may reflect a history of place-based exposures rather than (or in addition to) contemporaneous exposures; yet, few studies examined early life place exposures and later life mortality in the US due to data limitations. The aim of this study is to assess and compare the importance of state of birth and state of residence in predicting mortality for adults over age 50 in the US. Using nationally representative data of nearly 100,000 adults over age 50 from the National Longitudinal Mortality Study, we estimated individual mortality risk using multi-level logistic regression with state of birth and state of residence as second-level random effects. We assessed whether state of residence and state of birth contributed to the variation in adult mortality. We also decomposed state-of-residence random effects to compare ""movers"" and ""stayers."" Our results indicate that state of birth is a stronger predictor of age-, race/ethnicity- and sex-adjusted mortality in the US than state of residence at the time of death. The adult mortality profiles of many states are substantially impacted by the composition of ""movers."" Failing to account for residential mobility has clouded our understanding of the patterns and causes of geographic differences in adult mortality.

This paper draws from the 1960 US Decennial Census to examine whether exposed individuals had different family formation patterns than adjacent unexposed cohorts. The findings suggest small overall effects on marriage rates, number of children, and several measures of “type” of spouse for men, but moderate effects for women. The findings also show that exposed individuals have spouses with lower schooling than unexposed counterparts, this effect is particularly large for women, and it increases the likelihood of marrying spouses with very low levels of schooling.",2017,2017-05-15,1,{'Jason M.

We exclude patients with ICD-10 code-defined pregnancy, kidney failure on dialysis, or kidney transplantation. Data include demographics, anthropomorphics, U.S. Census Bureau tract, histories, blood pressure, ICD-10 codes, medications, laboratory and imaging results, and ambulatory blood pressure. SUPERHERO leverages expertise in epidemiology, statistics, clinical care, and biomedical informatics to create the largest and most diverse registry of youth with newly diagnosed hypertension disorders.

Coming home to rural America: demographic shifts in the Tenth District.,,"Sweeping demographic shifts are challenging the growth of many rural communities in the Tenth District. The retirement of the baby boomers, coupled with the exodus of young adults, threatens to leave rural areas with a rapidly aging population and a shrinking local workforce. The strength of these demographic changes could hinder economic growth for many rural communities in the future.Rural communities in the district, however, are quietly enjoying another demographic shift-a return of middle-aged residents to rural places. This shift may be a promising sign for economic growth and wealth generation. Rural areas, of course, must continue to face the challenges of an aging population and the loss of young adults. But the inmigration of middle-aged residents and their families could raise a new question for economic development. Instead of simply trying to stem the tide of young adult out-migration, should rural areas focus more on the recent trend of middle-aged families coming home to rural America?This article discusses the economic implications of aging populations and migration patterns on rural Tenth District communities. The first section explores how aging populations are threatening the economic growth potential of Tenth District states, especially in rural areas with high concentrations of retirement-age populations. The second section describes how the migration patterns of young adults leaving and eventually returning as middle-aged adults represent both challenges and opportunities for rural areas. The third section analyzes the economic implications of aging populations and these two migration patterns. While rural communities in the Tenth District will struggle with aging populations and the loss of young adults, enhancing quality-of-life amenities appear to be a way for rural communities to benefit from the return of middle-aged families.I. AGING POPULATIONS SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTHThe Tenth District is undergoing a demographic sea change that threatens to diminish the capacity for economic growth of many rural areas.1 The pending retirement of baby boomers (born from 1946 to 1 964) will soon slow the growth of the working age population and reduce labor force participation rates. These changes will pose significant challenges for rural areas, which typically have high concentrations of older people.A persons economic contribution changes over a lifetime. The young are net consumers. As they enter the workforce, they become net producers and help boost the production capacity of the economy. As they retire, they become net consumers again and reduce the production capacity of a region (Bloom and Canning).2 Thus, the districts economic growth potential emerges from three components: population growth, changing labor force participation rates, and productivity growth. Stronger gains in each segment boost economic development and vice versa (Kliessen 2007).Slower population growth could clip the districts economic growth potential over the next two decades. With each decennial census, the Census Bureau provides state population projections based on past population trends and national projections.' In 2005, the Census Bureau projected that the district's adult population growth, 16 years of age and older, was expected to decelerate, rising just 0.4 percent annually from 2008 to 2020. Adult population grew 1.1 annually from 1990 to 2008. Thus, slower growth in the adult population could trim the districts economic growth potential 0.7 percentage points.4Lower labor force participation rates could further trim the economic growth potential of district states. The number of retirement age residents (65 and older) has increased substantially in the district since the 1970s (Figure 1). From 2000 to 2020, national labor force participation rates are projected to drop from 67.1 to 64.5 percent due to retiring baby boomers, with sharper declines after 2020. 5 When national projections of labor force participation are applied to state population estimates, the district's labor force participation rate is projected to fall 0. …",2009,2009-06-22,7,"{'Jason Henderson', 'Maria Akers'}",,Regional Economics and Spatial Analysis; Regional Economic and Spatial Analysis; Economic Growth and Productivity,Econometric Reviews,article,Jason R Henderson,https://openalex.org/A5044429457,Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Chicago

Who Creates Jobs? Small vs. Large vs. Young,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1666157,"There's been a long, sometimes heated, debate on the role of firm size in employment growth. Despite skepticism in the academic community, the notion that growth is negatively related to firm size remains appealing to policymakers and small business advocates. The widespread and repeated claim from this community is that most new jobs are created by small businesses. Using data from the Census Bureau Business Dynamics Statistics and Longitudinal Business Database, we explore the many issues regarding the role of firm size and growth that have been at the core of this ongoing debate (such as the role of regression to the mean). We find that the relationship between firm size and employment growth is sensitive to these issues. However, our main finding is that once we control for firm age there is no systematic relationship between firm size and growth. Our findings highlight the important role of business startups and young businesses in U.S. job creation. Business startups contribute substantially to both gross and net job creation. In addition, we find an ""up or out"" dynamic of young firms.

Business dynamics of innovating firms: Linking U.S. patents with administrative data on workers and firms,https://doi.org/10.1111/jems.12260,"Abstract This paper discusses the construction of a new longitudinal database tracking inventors and patent‐owning firms over time.

In this paper, we describe the construction of the database and explore basic features of the data. We find patenting firms, particularly young patenting firms, disproportionally contribute jobs to the U.S. economy. We find that patenting is a relatively rare event among small firms but that most patenting firms are nevertheless small, and that patenting is not as rare an event for the youngest firms compared to the oldest firms.

The Promise and Peril of Entrepreneurship,https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/13873.001.0001,"A clearer view of entrepreneurship, based on new comprehensive data, that upends what we know about job creation and survival among US startups. Startups create jobs and power economic growth. That's an article of faith in the United States—but, as The Promise and Peril of Entrepreneurship reveals, our faith may be built on shaky ground. Economists Robert Fairlie, Zachary Kroff, Javier Miranda, and Nikolas Zolas—working with Census Bureau microdata—have developed a new data set, the Comprehensive Startup Panel, that tracks job creation and the survival of every startup in the country. In doing so, they recalibrate our understanding of how startups behave in the US economy. Specifically, their work seeks to answer three critical questions: How many jobs does each entrepreneur create? Do those jobs disappear quickly? And how long do entrepreneurial enterprises survive? Job creation and survival rates are, the authors conclude, much lower than those reported by official federal sources. Such discrepancies emerge from the more comprehensive picture drawn from this new data set—a picture that, for instance, highlights the important but understudied differences between employer firms (startups that hire people) and nonemployer firms (startups that do not initially hire people but may do so in later years as they grow). This reframing captures the vast number of businesses that start with no employees, a number largely missing from the statistics underpinning the mythos of the riskiness of entrepreneurship. The book also explores who owns startups—focusing on differences by race and ethnicity. With its new, wider view of the realities of job creation and survival among startups, The Promise and Peril of Entrepreneurship has significant implications for economic policymaking and research, and for the billions of dollars that the government and the private sector invest in promoting entrepreneurship.",2023,2023-06-29,6,"{'Javier Miranda', 'Nikolas Zolas', 'Robert W.

Technology Use and Worker Outcomes: Evidence from Linked Employer Employee Data,,"In the course of our project we have produced several papers using the Survey of Manufacturing Technologies, the Business Register and the Decennial Census in combination with external Unemployment Insurance Earnings Record files from the State of Maryland. In this Technical Report we discuss the benefits to the Census Bureau based on the results of this project. We focus on four sets of results. First, economic survey data can be successfully integrated with Decennial and administrative record data to increase the value of existing economic data products. We show that the resulting sample sizes are sufficiently large to justify the effort. Second, we demonstrate that the Survey of Manufacturing Technologies (SMT) has a significant longitudinal component that approximates 15% of the sample of plants. The sample is not representative of the population of surviving firms of similar characteristics. However, sample weights can be created to address this issue. Third, we show the viability of using the SMT for single state studies. We find that the SMT Maryland sample is fairly representative of manufacturing plants in Maryland although they tend to be somewhat younger and larger than the average for the state. Fourth, we show that the composition of the workforce varies considerably across plants of different technological intensity. We show how integrated microeconomic data can be used to shed light on the underlying factors behind this variation.",2008,2008-01-01,0,"{'Javier Miranda', 'Adela Luque'}",,Firm Innovation and Growth; Italy: Economic History and Contemporary Issues,,article,Javier - Miranda,https://openalex.org/A5050910881,Census of Wholesale Trade; Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue; FSRDC; Decennial Census; Census Bureau,Decennial Census; Census Bureau,Washington

Measuring the Impact of Household Innovation using Administrative Data,,"We link USPTO patent data to U.S. Census Bureau administrative records on individuals and firms. The combined dataset provides us with a directory of patenting household inventors as well as a time-series directory of self-employed businesses tied to household innovations. We describe the characteristics of household inventors by race, age, gender and U.S. origin, as well as the types of patented innovations pursued by these inventors. Business data allows us to highlight how patents shape the early life-cycle dynamics of nonemployer businesses. We find household innovators are disproportionately U.S. born, white and their age distribution has thicker tails relative to business innovators. Data shows there is a deficit of female and black inventors. Household inventors tend to work in consumer product areas compared to traditional business patents. While patented household innovations do not have the same impact of business innovations their uniqueness and impact remains surprisingly high.

Looking back on three years of using the synthetic LBD beta,https://doi.org/10.3233/sji-140811,"Distributions of business data are typically much more skewed than those for household or individual data and public knowledge of the underlying units is greater. As a results, national statistical offices (NSOs) rarely release establishment or firm-level business microdata due to the risk to respondent confidentiality. One potential approach for overcoming these risks is to release synthetic data where the establishment data are simulated from statistical models designed to mimic the distributions of the real underlying microdata. The US Census Bureau's Center for Economic Studies in collaboration with Duke University, the National Institute of Statistical Sciences, and Cornell University made available a synthetic public use file for the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) comprising more than 20 million records for all business establishment with paid employees dating back to 1976. The resulting product, dubbed the SynLBD, was released in 2010 and is the first-ever comprehensive business microdata set publicly released in the United States including data on establishments' employment and payroll, birth and death years, and industrial classification. This paper documents the scope of projects that have requested and used the SynLBD.",2014,2014-05-01,1,"{'Javier Miranda', 'Lars Vilhuber'}",United States Census Bureau; United States Census Bureau,Medical Imaging Techniques and Applications; Cardiac Valve Diseases and Treatments; Advanced Radiotherapy Techniques,Statistical Journal of the IAOS,article,Javier - Miranda,https://openalex.org/A5050910881,Census of Wholesale Trade; Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue; FSRDC; Decennial Census; Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Washington

Evaluating the Usefulness of the American Housing Survey for Creating House Price Indices,,"The American Housing Survey (AHS) is a valuable source of information on houses and occupants over time. The AHS has several advantages over sales data for use in the creation of price indices: it is readily available, has frequent observations over time and space, has data from the late 1970s through the mid 1990s, includes houses that do not sell, as well as those that do, and has information on the occupants. The drawbacks include: a time lag between the interview and the release of the data, data suppression issues, owner stated house values, and a lack of neighborhood information. In this study we use the metropolitan version of the AHS which has been supplemented with the original survey data as well as Census tract data for three cities over fourteen years to examine whether the AHS can be used to create indices. Indices are estimated using hedonic, repeat valuation, and hybrid techniques, overcoming some of the problems inherent in the estimation of indices. We find that the data suppression issues and the owner stated house values are not problematic. The biggest drawback of the AHS is its lack of objective information on neighborhood quality.",1997,1997-04-25,1,"{'Katherine A.

"Location, Location, Location: The 3L Approach to House Price Determination",,"The immobility of houses means that their location affects their values. This explains the common belief that three things determine the price of a house: location, location, and location. We use this notion to develop the 3L Approach to house price determination. That is, prices are determined by the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), town, and street where the house is located. This study creates a unique data set based on data from the American Housing Survey (AHS) consisting of small ‘clusters’ of housing units with information on their housing characteristics and resident characteristics that is merged with census tract-level attributes. We use this data to verify the 3L Approach: we find that all three levels of location are significant when estimating the house price hedonic equation. This indicates that individuals care about their local neighborhood, i.e. the general upkeep of their street and possibly their neighbors’ characteristics (cluster variables), a broader area such as the school district and/or the town (tract variables) that account for school quality and crime rates, and the particular amenities found in their MSA.",2004,2004-05-01,18,"{'Katherine A.

"Interactions, Neighborhood Selection, and Housing Demand",,"This paper contributes to the growing literature that identifies and measures the impact of social context on individual economic behavior. We develop a model of housing demand with neighborhood e®ects and neighborhood choice. Modelling neighborhood choice is of fundamental importance in estimating and understanding endogenous and exogenous neighborhood effects.

Estimation of the model exploits a unique data set of household data that has been augmented with contextual information at two di®erent levels (“scales”) of aggregation.

"Interactions, Neighborhood Selection, and Housing Demand",,"This paper contributes to the growing literature that identifies and measures the impact of social context on individual economic behavior. We develop a model of housing demand with neighborhood e®ects and neighborhood choice. Modelling neighborhood choice is of fundamental importance in estimating and understanding endogenous and exogenous neighborhood effects. That is, to obtain unbiased estimates of neighborhood effects, it is necessary to control for non-random sorting into neighborhoods. Estimation of the model exploits a unique data set of household data that has been augmented with contextual information at two di®erent levels (“scales”) of aggregation. One is at the neighborhood cluster level, of about ten neighbors, with the data coming from a special sample of the American Housing Survey. A second level is the census tract to which these dwelling units belong. Tract-level data are available in the Summary Tape Files of the decennial Census data. We merge these two data sets by gaining access to confidential data of the U.S. Bureau of the Census. We overcome some limitations of these data by implementing some significant methodological advances in estimating discrete choice models. Our results for the neighborhood choice model indicate that individuals prefer to live near others like themselves. This can perpetuate income inequality since those with the best opportunities at economic success will cluster together. The results for the housing demand equation are similar to those in our earlier work [Ioannides and Zabel (2000] where we find evidence of significant endogenous and contextual neighborhood effects.",2002,2002-08-01,17,"{'Yannis M.

THE SHORT‐RUN EMPLOYMENT EFFECTS OF RECENT MINIMUM WAGE CHANGES: EVIDENCE FROM THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY,https://doi.org/10.1111/coep.12279,"This paper presents early evidence on the employment effects of state minimum wage increases enacted between January 2013 and January 2015. As of 2015, we estimate that relatively large minimum wage increases (defined as those exceeding $1) reduced employment among low‐skilled population groups by just over 1 percentage point. Smaller minimum wage increases, as well as increases linked to inflation indexation provisions, appear to have had much smaller (and possibly positive) effects on employment over our sample period. The estimates thus raise the potential importance of nonlinearities in the minimum wage's effects, which are consistent with standard models of the labor market.

Drawing on Census and American Community Survey data from 1990 to 2010, we first explore whether changes in racial/ethnic composition occur alongside ascent. We find that, while most neighborhoods’ racial/ethnic composition does not dramatically change during this period, neighborhoods that experienced ascent are much more likely to transition from majority-minority to mixed race or predominantly White than nonascending neighborhoods. Then, we use microdata to analyze whether two potential drivers of ascent, the in-migration of higher-socioeconomic status (SES) households and changes in the fortunes of long-term residents, are racially/ethnically stratified. We argue that the process of neighborhood socioeconomic ascent perpetuates neighborhood racial/ethnic hierarchy. While most Black and Hispanic neighborhoods remain majority-minority, those that ascend are more likely to experience a succession of high-SES White residents replacing minority residents.",2018,2018-04-19,32,"{'Jennifer Candipan', 'Ann Marie Deer Owens'}",University of Southern California; University of Southern California,"Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Homelessness and Social Issues; Migration and Labor Dynamics",Urban Affairs Review,article,Jennifer Candipan,https://openalex.org/A5015980834,American Community Survey; USC RDC; FSRDC; Decennial Census; Census Bureau,American Community Survey,USC
Millennials as a Demographic Bridge to Diversity? Segregation and Diversity of Young Adult Neighborhoods,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4jbre,"As young adults, the Millennial generation arrived as the largest and most racially and ethnically diverse generation in U.S. history. These unique demographic characteristics, along with more progressive self-reported views on racial and ethnic issues, have prompted some to label this generation as a demographic bridge to America’s diverse future. This article examines whether these unique characteristics translate into greater neighborhood racial diversity and integration. Specifically, this study sets out to answer whether Millennial young adult neighborhoods are more racially and ethnically diverse and located in less segregated metropolitan areas than the young adult neighborhoods of prior generations. Using 1990-2019 Census and American Community Survey data, we find a mixed story. On the one hand, young adult White Early Millennials were living in neighborhoods with similar or slightly higher diversity levels, and metropolitan areas with similar or slightly lower segregation levels compared to White young adults in prior generations. On the other hand, young adult White Late Millennials tend to live in more segregated neighborhoods, and in most cases, their segregation levels surpass those for White young adult Gen Xers. These mixed findings provide moderate support for the perspective that the Millennial generation is a bridge to diversity, albeit not the final destination. There is evidence of positive changes towards residential racial integration, but resilience in segregated patterns still remain.",2023,2023-05-13,0,"{'Jennifer Candipan', 'Noli Brazil'}","University of California, Davis; University of California, Berkeley; SHIELDS for Families; John Brown University; University of California, Berkeley; SHIELDS for Families; John Brown University; University of California, Davis","Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Urbanization and City Planning; Rural development and sustainability",,preprint,Jennifer Candipan,https://openalex.org/A5015980834,American Community Survey; USC RDC; FSRDC; Decennial Census; Census Bureau,American Community Survey,USC
Citizenship Reporting in the American Community Survey,https://doi.org/10.4054/demres.2013.29.1,"Citizenship status among the foreign born is a crucial indicator of social and political incorporation, yet there are good reasons to suspect that citizenship status is inaccurately reported on U.S. surveys.This paper updates research carried out in the mid-1990s by Passel and Clark (1997) on the extent to which foreign-born non-citizen respondents in U.S. government-sponsored surveys misreport as naturalized citizens.We compare demographic estimates of the resident naturalized foreign-born population in 2010, based on administrative data, to estimates from the 2010 American Community Survey (ACS).Similar to previous research, we find that misreporting in the ACS is especially high among immigrants from all countries/regions who report fewer than five years in the U.S. We also find that among longer-term foreign-born residents, misreporting is concentrated only among those originating in Mexico, especially men, a finding that diverges from Passel and Clark in that we find no evidence of over-reporting among immigrants from Central America and the Caribbean. Finally, the estimated magnitude of misreporting, especially among longer-term Mexican-born men, is sensitive to assumptions about the rate of emigration in our administrative-based demographic estimates, and assumptions about coverage error in the ACS, though altering these assumptions does not change the conclusions drawn from the general patterns of the results.For applications that use citizenship as an indicator of legal status, we recommend that self-reported data on citizenship be accepted at face value for all groups except those with less than five years of U.S. residence and Mexican men.",2013,2013-07-02,31,"{'James D.

Using data from the 2008–2010 American Community Survey and 1998–2010 Integrated Health Interview Series, we demonstrate how naturalization, a key indicator of social and political inclusion, is related to functional health in midlife and older age. Consistent with the theoretical framework, we find that among those foreign-born who immigrated as children and young adults, naturalized citizens show better health at older ages compared with noncitizens, although this relationship is partly mediated by education. But among those older foreign-born who immigrated at middle and older ages, naturalized citizens report worse health compared with noncitizens.

Researchers use demographic methods to generate aggregated information about the number and demographic composition of the unauthorized immigrant population. But understanding their social and economic characteristics (e.g., educational attainment, occupations) often requires identifying likely unauthorized immigrants at the individual level. We describe a new method that pools data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), which identifies unauthorized immigrants, with data from the American Community Survey (ACS), which does not. This method treats unauthorized status as missing data to be imputed by multiple imputation techniques. Likely unauthorized immigrants in the ACS are identified based on similarities to self-reported unauthorized immigrants in the SIPP.

Uncertainty About the Size of the Unauthorized Foreign-Born Population in the United States,https://doi.org/10.1215/00703370-9491801,"Abstract One of the most common methods for estimating the U.S. unauthorized foreign-born population is the residual method. Over the last decade, residual estimates have typically fallen within a narrow range of 10.5 to 12 million. Yet it remains unclear how sensitive residual estimates are to their underlying assumptions. We examine the extent to which estimates may plausibly vary owing to uncertainties in their underlying assumptions about coverage error, emigration, and mortality. Findings show that most of the range in residual estimates derives from uncertainty about emigration rates among legal permanent residents, naturalized citizens, and humanitarian entrants (LNH); estimates are less sensitive to assumptions about mortality among the LNH foreign-born and coverage error for the unauthorized and LNH populations in U.S. Census Bureau surveys. Nevertheless, uncertainty in all three assumptions contributes to a range of estimates, whereby there is a 50% chance that the unauthorized foreign-born population falls between 9.1 and 12.2 million and a 95% chance that it falls between 7.0 and 15.7 million.",2021,2021-09-27,13,"{'Randy Capps', 'Jennifer Van Hook', 'Julia Gelatt', 'Anne Morse'}",Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University; Migration Policy Institute; Migration Policy Institute,"Migration and Labor Dynamics; Migration, Health and Trauma; Migration, Refugees, and Integration",Demography,article,Jennifer L Van Hook,https://openalex.org/A5052990364,American Community Survey; BOC Crosswalk 1940 IPUMS Research; Census Bureau; 1940 IPUMS Research,Census Bureau,Penn State

We use the cohort component method to estimate population size across different migration scenarios and distinguish between aging in place and new immigration. We also examine contemporary health insurance coverage and chronic health conditions among 55 and older undocumented Latinos from the 2003-2014 California Health Interview Survey. We then project health insurance rates in 2038 among Latino immigrants under different migration and policy scenarios.If current mortality, migration, and policy trends continue, projections estimate that 40% of undocumented Latino immigrants will be 55 years or older by 2038-nearly all of whom will have aged in place. Currently, 40% of older Latino undocumented immigrants do not have insurance. Without policies that increase access to insurance, projections estimate that the share who are uninsured among all older Latinos immigrants will rise from 15% to 21%, and the share who is both uninsured and living with a chronic health condition will rise from 5% to 9%.Without access to health care, older undocumented immigrants may experience delayed care and more severe morbidity.

Beyond Stocks and Surges: The Demographic Impact of the Unauthorized Immigrant Population in the United States,https://doi.org/10.1111/padr.12683,"Abstract Stock estimates of the US unauthorized foreign‐born population are routinely published, but less is known about this population's dynamics. Using a series of residual estimates based on 2000 Census and 2001–2022 American Community Survey (ACS), I estimate the components of change for the unauthorized immigrant population from 2000 to 2022 by region and country of origin. Further, I develop and present novel measures of expected duration in unauthorized status and demographic impact of unauthorized entries (i.e., person‐years lived in unauthorized status). Results reveal dramatic changes over the last two decades. In the early 2000s, the unauthorized immigrant population was dominated by Mexicans who tended to remain in the United States for extended periods of time and whose demographic impact on the US population was substantial. After the 2007–2008 Great Recession, a new pattern emerged. Unauthorized migrants now arrive from across the globe, including Central America and Asia (up through 2018), and most recently from Europe, Africa, Canada, Venezuela, and other parts of South America. These new unauthorized immigrants are more likely to arrive on temporary nonimmigrant visas (which typically allow a foreigner to live and work in the United States for six years) and, with the exception of Venezuelans, spend less time in unauthorized status. Overall, the demographic impact of this new type of unauthorized migration is lower than it was two decades ago.",2024,2024-10-28,2,{'Jennifer Van Hook'},Pennsylvania State University,"Migration and Labor Dynamics; Migration, Health and Trauma; Migration, Refugees, and Integration",Population and Development Review,article,Jennifer L Van Hook,https://openalex.org/A5052990364,American Community Survey; BOC Crosswalk 1940 IPUMS Research; Census Bureau; 1940 IPUMS Research,American Community Survey,Penn State

An Empirical Comparison of Multiple Imputation Methods for Categorical Data,https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2016.1277158,"Multiple imputation is a common approach for dealing with missing values in statistical databases. The imputer fills in missing values with draws from predictive models estimated from the observed data, resulting in multiple, completed versions of the database. Researchers have developed a variety of default routines to implement multiple imputation; however, there has been limited research comparing the performance of these methods, particularly for categorical data. We use simulation studies to compare repeated sampling properties of three default multiple imputation methods for categorical data, including chained equations using generalized linear models, chained equations using classification and regression trees, and a fully Bayesian joint distribution based on Dirichlet Process mixture models. We base the simulations on categorical data from the American Community Survey. In the circumstances of this study, the results suggest that default chained equations approaches based on generalized linear models are dominated by the default regression tree and Bayesian mixture model approaches. They also suggest competing advantages for the regression tree and Bayesian mixture model approaches, making both reasonable default engines for multiple imputation of categorical data.

Simultaneous edit-imputation and disclosure limitation for business establishment data,https://doi.org/10.1080/02664763.2016.1267123,"Business establishment microdata typically are required to satisfy agency-specified edit rules, such as balance equations and linear inequalities. Inevitably some establishments' reported data violate the edit rules. Statistical agencies correct faulty values using a process known as edit-imputation. Business establishment data also must be heavily redacted before being shared with the public; indeed, confidentiality concerns lead many agencies not to share establishment microdata as unrestricted access files. When microdata must be heavily redacted, one approach is to create synthetic data, as done in the U.S. Longitudinal Business Database and the German IAB Establishment Panel.

"Inferentially Valid, Partially Synthetic Data: Generating from Posterior Predictive Distributions not Necessary",,"To limit the risks of disclosures when releasing public use data on individual records, statistical agencies and other data disseminators can release multiply-imputed, partially synthetic data (Little, 1993; Reiter, 2003). These comprise the units originally surveyed with some collected values, e.g. sensitive values at high risk of disclosure or values of quasi-identifiers, replaced with multiple imputations. Partially synthetic data can protect confidentiality, since identification of units and their sensitive data can be difficult when select values in the released data are not actual, collected values. And, with appropriate estimation methods based on the concepts of multiple imputation (Rubin, 1987), they enable data users to make valid inferences for a variety of estimands using standard, complete-data statistical methods and software. Because of these appealing features, partially synthetic data products have been developed for several major data sources in the U.S., including the Longitudinal Business Database (Kinney et al., 2011), the Survey of Income and Program Participation (Abowd et al., 2006), the American Community Survey group quarters data (Hawala, 2008), and the OnTheMap database of where people live and work (Machanavajjhala et al., 2008). Other examples of partially synthetic data are described in Abowd and Woodcock (2004), Little et al. (2004), Drechsler et al. (2008), and Drechsler and Reiter (2010). In the statistical theory underlying the generation of partially synthetic data, as well as typical implementations in practice, replacement values are sampled from posterior predictive distributions. That is, the agency repeatedly draws values of the model parameters from their posterior distributions, and generates a set of replacement values based on each parameter draw. The motivation for sampling from posterior predictive distributions derives from multiple imputation of missing data, in which drawing the parameters is necessary to enable approximately unbiased variance estimation (Rubin, 1987, Chapter 4). In this article, we argue that it is not necessary to draw parameters to enable valid inferences with partially synthetic data. Instead, data disseminators can estimate posterior modes or maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in synthesis models, and simulate replacement values after plugging those modes into the models. Using a simple but informative case, we show mathematically that point and variance estimates based on the plug-in",2012,2012-05-31,31,"{'Jerome P. Reiter', 'Satkartar K.

We present a data fusion framework for leveraging this information to improve inferences in the error-prone survey. The basic idea is to posit models about the rates at which individuals make errors, coupled with models for the values reported when errors are made. This can avoid the unrealistic assumption of conditional independence typically used in data fusion. We apply the approach on the reported values of educational attainments in the American Community Survey, using the National Survey of College Graduates as the high-quality data source.

Simultaneous Edit and Imputation For Household Data with Structural Zeros,https://doi.org/10.1093/jssam/smy022,"Multivariate categorical data nested within households often include reported values that fail edit constraints---for example, a participating household reports a child's age as older than his biological parent's age---as well as missing values. Generally, agencies prefer datasets to be free from erroneous or missing values before analyzing them or disseminating them to secondary data users. We present a model-based engine for editing and imputation of household data based on a Bayesian hierarchical model that includes (i) a nested data Dirichlet process mixture of products of multinomial distributions as the model for the true latent values of the data, truncated to allow only households that satisfy all edit constraints, (ii) a model for the location of errors, and (iii) a reporting model for the observed responses in error. The approach propagates uncertainty due to unknown locations of errors and missing values, generates plausible datasets that satisfy all edit constraints, and can preserve multivariate relationships within and across individuals in the same household.

Simultaneous Edit-Imputation for Continuous Microdata,https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1461706.v1,"Many statistical organizations collect data that are expected to satisfy linear constraints; as examples, component variables should sum to total variables, and ratios of pairs of variables should be bounded by expert-specified constants. When reported data violate constraints, organizations identify and replace values potentially in error in a process known as edit-imputation. To date, most approaches separate the error localization and imputation steps, typically using optimization methods to identify the variables to change followed by hot deck imputation. We present an approach that fully integrates editing and imputation for continuous microdata under linear constraints. Our approach relies on a Bayesian hierarchical model that includes (i) a flexible joint probability model for the underlying true values of the data with support only on the set of values that satisfy all editing constraints, (ii) a model for latent indicators of the variables that are in error, and (iii) a model for the reported responses for variables in error. We illustrate the potential advantages of the Bayesian editing approach over existing approaches using simulation studies.

Data Fusion for Correcting Measurement Errors,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1610.00147,"Often in surveys, key items are subject to measurement errors. Given just the data, it can be difficult to determine the distribution of this error process, and hence to obtain accurate inferences that involve the error-prone variables. In some settings, however, analysts have access to a data source on different individuals with high quality measurements of the error-prone survey items. We present a data fusion framework for leveraging this information to improve inferences in the error-prone survey. The basic idea is to posit models about the rates at which individuals make errors, coupled with models for the values reported when errors are made. This can avoid the unrealistic assumption of conditional independence typically used in data fusion. We apply the approach on the reported values of educational attainments in the American Community Survey, using the National Survey of College Graduates as the high quality data source. In doing so, we account for the informative sampling design used to select the National Survey of College Graduates. We also present a process for assessing the sensitivity of various analyses to different choices for the measurement error models.

Estimating Identification Disclosure Risk Using Mixed Membership Models,https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2012.710508,"Statistical agencies and other organizations that disseminate data are obligated to protect data subjects' confidentiality. For example, ill-intentioned individuals might link data subjects to records in other databases by matching on common characteristics (keys). Successful links are particularly problematic for data subjects with combinations of keys that are unique in the population. Hence, as part of their assessments of disclosure risks, many data stewards estimate the probabilities that sample uniques on sets of discrete keys are also population uniques on those keys. This is typically done using log-linear modeling on the keys. However, log-linear models can yield biased estimates of cell probabilities for sparse contingency tables with many zero counts, which often occurs in databases with many keys. This bias can result in unreliable estimates of probabilities of uniqueness and, hence, misrepresentations of disclosure risks. We propose an alternative to log-linear models for datasets with sparse keys based on a Bayesian version of grade of membership (GoM) models. We present a Bayesian GoM model for multinomial variables and offer a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for fitting the model. We evaluate the approach by treating data from a recent U.S. Census Bureau public use microdata sample as a population, taking simple random samples from that population, and benchmarking estimated probabilities of uniqueness against population values. Compared to log-linear models, GoM models provide more accurate estimates of the total number of uniques in the samples. Additionally, they offer record-level predictions of uniqueness that dominate those based on log-linear models. This article has online supplementary materials.",2012,2012-07-30,30,"{'Jerome P.

Plant-Level Productivity and Imputation of Missing Data in the Census of Manufactures,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1759396,"In the U.S. Census of Manufactures, the Census Bureau imputes missing values using a combination of mean imputation, ratio imputation, and conditional mean imputation. It is well-known that imputations based on these methods can result in underestimation of variability and potential bias in multivariate inferences. We show that this appears to be the case for the existing imputations in the Census of Manufactures. We then present an alternative strategy for handling the missing data based on multiple imputation. Specifically, we impute missing values via sequences of classification and regression trees, which offer a computationally straightforward and flexible approach for semi-automatic, large-scale multiple imputation. We also present an approach to evaluating these imputations based on posterior predictive checks. We use the multiple imputations, and the imputations currently employed by the Census Bureau, to estimate production function parameters and productivity dispersions.

Commentary: Sharing Confidential Data for Research Purposes,https://doi.org/10.1097/ede.0b013e318225c44b,"In a recent editorial, the editors of Epidemiology invited authors to make their analytic and simulation codes, questionnaires, and data used in analyses available to other researchers.1 Much has been written about the need for data sharing and reproducible research, and many journals and funding agencies have explicit data-sharing policies.2,3 When data are confidential, however, investigators typically cannot release them as collected, because doing so could reveal data subjects' identities or values of sensitive attributes, thereby violating ethical and potentially legal obligations to protect confidentiality. At first glance, safely sharing confidential data seems a straightforward task: simply strip unique identifiers such as names, addresses, and identification numbers before releasing the data. However, these actions alone may not suffice when other identifying variables, such as geographic or demographic data, remain in the file. These quasi-identifiers can be used to match units in the released data to other databases. For example, Sweeney4 showed that 97% of the records in publicly available voter registration lists for Cambridge, MA, could be uniquely identified using birth date and 9-digit zip code. By matching the information in these lists, she was able to identify Massachusetts Governor William Weld in an anonymized medical database. As the amount of information readily available to the public continues to expand (eg, via the Internet and private companies), investigators releasing large-scale epidemiologic data run the risk of similar breaches. In this commentary, we present a primer on techniques for sharing confidential data. We classify techniques into 2 broad classes: restricted access, in which access is provided only to trusted users, and restricted data, in which the original data are somehow altered before sharing. Restricted-access Strategies Sharing unaltered confidential data with external researchers, while preserving confidentiality, is referred to as restricted-access methods. If one or more researchers have been trusted to analyze confidential data, it seems logical that they should be able to share the data with additional trusted researchers. However, researchers may be prevented by law or by the policies of their institution or sponsoring agency from sharing the data, even with their colleagues. Without procedures and rules for sharing data, there is little an individual researcher can do. There are 2 primary restricted-access methods employed by most data stewards, including government agencies and individual investigators: licensing agreements and restricted-data centers.5 Under the licensing model, researchers with legitimate research questions that can be answered with the confidential data enter into an agreement with the data steward and are provided with a copy of the data for use at their home institution. Typically, agreements specify how the data should be protected, and may require certification of destruction at project completion. Fees may be charged to cover data processing and administrative costs. In some cases, such as licensing agreements with the National Center for Education Statistics, the data are slightly altered to introduce a small amount of uncertainty, but not enough to concern analysts. In the data-center model, researchers must carry out their research in a physically and electronically secure facility controlled by the data steward. Researchers are often required to submit a proposal describing the research plans, the confidential data needed, and in some cases how their research will benefit the data steward. In additional to travel expenses, researchers may be required to pay substantial fees to access the data center, and they cannot remove any output without approval from the data steward. The US Census Bureau and National Center for Health Statistics provide researchers access to confidential data in this manner. An alternative is a secure online data center, such as the National Opinion Research Centers Virtual Data Enclave. Confidential data are stored on secure servers that approved researchers can access through remote login from prespecified IP addresses. The researcher can see and analyze the actual data, but the server disables local saving, printing of the data and analysis results, and cut-and-paste operations. As with a physical data enclave, analysis results are checked for potential disclosure violations by Center staff before being approved for publication outside the enclave. The virtual enclave has advantages over licensing models, in that the risks of breaches are centrally managed, for example, there are no misplaced CD ROMs or unapproved file sharing. A variant on the virtual data enclave is the remote analysis server. This is a query-based system that provides the results of analyses of confidential data without actually allowing users to see the confidential values, thus reducing disclosure risks.6–8 Examples include the US Census Bureau's American FactFinder, which is available to anyone but produces only tabular summaries, or the Australian Remote Access Data Laboratory, which restricts users but allows more flexible analyses. Other query-based methods under research include verification servers,9 which provide users with feedback on the quality of analyses based on redacted public use data, and output perturbation through differential privacy,10 whereby noise is added to query results, so that they do not provide information about any individual with certainty. Restricted-data Strategies Although restricted-access policies use trust and physical protection, restricted-data policies provide unfettered access to data that have been modified before release. The key issue for data stewards is determining how much alteration is needed to ensure protection without completely destroying the usefulness of the data. To make informed decisions about this trade-off, data stewards can quantify disclosure risk and data usefulness associated with particular release strategies. For example, when 2 competing policies result in approximately the same disclosure risk, the one with higher data usefulness should be selected. Quantifiable metrics can help data stewards decide when the risks are sufficiently low, and the usefulness is adequately high, to justify releasing the altered data.11,12 The literature on disclosure risk assessment highlights 2 main types of disclosures, namely (i) identification disclosures, which occur when an ill-intentioned user of the data (henceforth called an intruder) correctly identifies individual records in the released data, and (ii) attribute disclosures, which occur when an intruder learns the values of sensitive variables for individual records in the data. Attribute disclosures usually are preceded by identity disclosures—for example, when original values of attributes are released, intruders who correctly identify records learn the attribute values—so that focus typically is on identification-disclosure risk assessments. See the reports of the National Research Council13,14 and Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology15 for more information about attribute disclosure risks.16 Identification-disclosure risk measures are often based on estimates of the probabilities that individuals can be identified in the released data. Probabilities of identification are easily interpreted: the larger the probability, the greater the risk. Stewards determine their own threshold for unsafe probabilities. A variety of approaches have been used to estimate these probabilities.17–22 People who are unique in the population (as opposed to the sample) are particularly at risk.23 Therefore, much research has gone into estimating the probability that a sample unique record is in fact a population unique record.24,25 Usefulness of the data is usually assessed with 2 general approaches: (1) comparing broad differences between the original and released data and (2) comparing differences in specific models between the original and released data. Broad difference measures essentially quantify some statistical distance between the distributions of the data on the original and released files, for example, a Kullback-Leibler or Hellinger distance.26 As the distance between the distributions grows, the overall quality of the released data generally drops.27,28 Comparison of measures based on specific models is often performed informally. For example, the steward looks at the similarity of point estimates and standard errors of regression coefficients after fitting the same regression on the original data and on the data proposed for release. If the results are considered close (eg, if the confidence intervals obtained from the models largely overlap), the released data have high utility for that particular analysis.29 Such measures are closely tied to how the data are used, but they provide a limited representation of the overall quality of the released data. Thus, it is prudent to examine models that represent a wide range of uses of the released data. Risks can be reduced by altering data, using one or more statistical-disclosure-limitation strategies. Common approaches include coarsening, data swapping, noise addition, and synthetic data. Examples of coarsening include releasing geography as aggregated regions, reporting exact values only below or above certain thresholds (known as top or bottom coding), collapsing levels of categorical variables, and rounding numerical values. Recoding reduces disclosure risks by turning atypical records—which generally are most at risk—into typical records. Recodes frequently are specified to reduce estimated probabilities of identification to acceptable levels (eg, no cell in a cross-tabulation of a set of key categorical variables has fewer than k individuals, where k is often 3 or 5). Data swapping refers to switching the data values for selected records with those for other records.30 The protection afforded by swapping is based in large part on perception: data stewards expect that intruders will be discouraged from linking to external files, as any apparent matches could be incorrect due to the swapping. The details of the swapping mechanism are almost always kept secret to reduce the potential for reverse engineering. Adding random noise to sensitive or identifying data values can reduce disclosure risks because errors are introduced into the released data, making it difficult for intruders to match on the released values with confidence.31,32 For numerical data, typically, the noise is generated from a distribution with a mean of zero to ensure point estimates of means remain unbiased, although the variance associated with those estimated mean may increase. However, zero-mean noise still can lead to attenuation in point estimates of correlations and regression coefficients. Partially synthetic data methods replace some collected values, such as sensitive values at high risk of disclosure or values of key identifiers, with multiple imputations.8,33–35 For example, suppose that the steward wants to replace income when it exceeds $100,000—because the steward considers only these individuals to be at risk for disclosure—and is willing to release all other values as collected. (Alternatively, the steward could synthesize the key identifiers for persons with incomes exceeding $100,000 with the goal of reducing risks that these individuals might be identified.) The steward generates replacement values for the incomes over $100,000 by randomly simulating from the distribution of income conditional on all other variables. To avoid bias, this distribution must be conditional on income exceeding $100,000. The distribution is estimated using the collected data and possibly other relevant information. This yields one synthetic dataset. The steward repeats this process multiple times and releases the multiple datasets to the public. The multiple datasets enable secondary analysts to reflect the uncertainty from simulating replacement values in inferences. Among the restricted-data techniques described here, partial synthesis is the newest and least commonly used. A stronger version of synthetic data is full synthesis, in which all values in the released data are simulated.36,37 This approach may become appealing in the future, if confidentiality concerns grow to the point where no original data can be released in unrestricted public use files. CONCLUSION To reproduce research conducted on confidential data, researchers will likely need access to the same confidential data used by the original investigators. It is possible in some cases for restricted-data methods to be used, but for the purpose of reproducibility, restricted-access methods hold more promise. This is not to say that restricted-data methods do not have their place, as they enable many other benefits of data sharing. For both restricted data and restricted access, the methods that we describe may be too cumbersome for individual researchers to implement independently. We believe it is incumbent upon research institutions and sponsors, journals, and other advocates of reproducibility to facilitate sharing of confidential data by establishing procedures and policies for sharing confidential data and perhaps creating confidential data repositories. Authors who obtain their confidential data from such repositories could comply with a data-sharing invitation such as the one put forth by Epidemiology by providing detailed instructions for obtaining the confidential data.

Ethnic and generational differences in partnership patterns among Asians in the United States,https://doi.org/10.1080/1369183x.2020.1770582,"Despite extensive research on the changes in partnership formation patterns in the United States over the past few decades, we know relatively little about how Asians are approaching marriage and cohabitation in early adulthood. Using the 2014–2018 American Community Survey, we examine whether Asians are delaying marriage and whether their postponement of marriage is offset by a rise in cohabitation. When doing so, we pay close attention to variations by ethnicity and immigrant generational status. We find that there is a substantial generational decline in marriage among Asians, accompanied by a relatively small increase in cohabitation. Thus, it is likely that 1.5-generation and U.S.-born Asians are waiting longer to enter coresidential partnerships than Asians who immigrated to the U.S. after age 12 and U.S.-born whites. Also, there are ethnic variations: cohabitation is rare among Indians whereas it is more common for Japanese and Filipino/as. The distinct patterns of 1.5-generation and U.S.-born Asians suggest that they are selectively acculturating.

,https://doi.org/10.1097/00005650-200307001-00005,"Background. Many proposed policy initiatives involve subsidies directed toward encouraging employers to offer coverage and toward workers to encourage enrollment in offered plans. Given that insurance coverage reflects employers' decisions to offer coverage, eligibility requirements for such coverage, and employees' take-up decisions, all three elements are important when considering mechanisms to decrease the number of uninsured individuals. Research Design. In this study, we examine the relationship between workers' decisions to take-up offers of health insurance and annual out-of-pocket contributions, total premiums, and employer and workforce characteristics. We model the take-up decision using cross-sectional data from approximately 18,000 establishments per year from the 1997 to 1999 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance Component. Results. We find that workers are less likely to enroll in coverage as single employee contributions increase. Our results for family contributions are much smaller than for single contributions and are not statistically significant in all years. Our simulation results suggest that reducing employee contribution levels for single coverage from existing levels in 1999 to zero would yield an increase in take-up rates of roughly 6% points in establishments that had required a positive level of contributions. Our results also indicate that of the 13.8 million private sector workers who decline coverage from their employers, 2.5 million would potentially enroll in employer-sponsored coverage if the cost of single coverage were to fall to zero. Conclusion. Reducing employee contributions will increase take-up rates; however, even when employees pay nothing for their coverage, some employees elect not to enroll.",2003,2003-06-28,4,"{'Phillip J.

Declines in Employer Sponsored Health Insurance Coverage: Differences by Firm Size,,"Even before the current recession, employer-sponsored health insurance rates declined dramatically, falling 6.2 percentage points between 2000 and 2006 for non-elderly Americans. This decline reversed a previous upward trend from 1997 to 2000. During the last documented period of decline, 1987 to 1996, Cooper and Schone (1997) analyzed household survey data and demonstrated that the fall in employer-sponsored coverage was due to a decline in take-up rates for offered coverage, not a decline in employer offer rates. There has been little research since then that tracks the components of the more recent period of decline in employment related coverage. In this paper, we use data from private sector employers in the 2000 and 2008 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component (MEPS-IC). Using this data allows us to examine changes in employee-level coverage rates in combination with detailed data on employee premium contributions and the wage and firm size distribution of employers. Our work will establish a baseline that will help evaluate changes resulting from the anticipated enactment of health care reform legislation in the near future. We decompose overall changes in employee coverage rates into the following components: changes in the percent of employees in establishments that offer health insurance (offer rates), eligibility rates, overall percent of employees eligible for health insurance that are enrolled in health insurance (enrollment or take-up rates) and enrollment rates for single and family coverage among those eligible for coverage. We investigate whether there are differences in trends in these components by the firm size and wage distribution of employers. We provide descriptive statistics for these components, providing additional detail for enrollment rates on the relationship between mean enrollment rates and employee premium contributions. We also use econometric decomposition techniques to investigate whether changes in the components of coverage rates are due to changes in the explanatory variables or changes in coefficients.Preliminary analyses indicate that the underlying components of the more recent decline differ from those in the earlier period, particularly for the smallest firms (with < 10 workers). In those firms, offer rates declined and take-up rates increased. For the largest employers (with 1,000 or more workers) offer rates remained steady. Since eligibility rates remained steady in the smallest firms, the decline in access to coverage may be due to fewer offers. Among all but the smallest employers, the explanations for the decline in coverage rates echoed those of the earlier time period - declining take-up rates were responsible for the decline in coverage. These changes may reflect the increases in the share of total premiums paid by employees over this period for employees in the largest firms and those with 25-99 employees. In contrast, the share of total premiums remained steady for employees in the smallest firms which may explain their more stable trends in take-up rates.

Premium Growth between 1997 and 2004 and its Effect on Employer-Sponsored Insurance,,"While economic theory predicts that workers bear the cost of rising health insurance premiums with reductions in wages and/or other benefits, empirical evidence on the existence of a wage-health insurance tradeoff has been mixed. Empirical analyses have been hampered by the fact that individuals with employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) are usually more skilled and have higher wages than those without insurance. For instance, a simple regression of wages on the presence of health insurance typically leads to a positive, rather than a negative relationship. Several recent studies have used difference-in-differences strategies to explore this topic across geographic areas with differing health care costs or inflation rates. For instance, Sheiner (1999) finds evidence that age-wage profiles are flattest in high-health cost areas, reflecting the incidence of health costs on workers' wages. Sommers (2005) finds evidence that when employers are faced with rising premiums, the increased insurance costs can be better absorbed through wage adjustments in areas with high general inflation or by high wage workers. Both of these studies analyzed household level survey data. We extend this literature using employer level data from the 1999-2004 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance Component (MEPS-IC), a large, nationally representative survey of employers and their health insurance plans. We also extend prior work in that we use difference-in-differences strategies to examine the effect of high premium growth on a wider set of health insurance outcomes: the likelihood that an employer will offer insurance, the levels of employee premium contributions and the generosity of benefits. Our strategies involve comparing areas with varying levels of premium growth, general inflation and employers with different wage distributions. To form premium-specific inflation measures, we predict values from a hedonic regression of MEPS-IC premiums on various MSA-level measures of health care costs as well as plan type and benefits. MSA-level predictions are then formed by fixing plan type and benefits, so that the only source of variation is health care costs. To identify areas with varying levels of inflation, we combine the MEPS-IC data with the CPI for Metropolitan Statistical Areas (which provides MSA-specific inflation rates over time). The MEPS-IC data are arguably better suited for studying many aspects of the ESI market than are widely-used household data sources such as the CPS or the MEPS-Household Component and provides a rich data resource for exploring a wide range of hypotheses regarding the impact of premium growth on the presence and generosity of ESI offers.",2007,2007-06-01,0,"{'Thomas M.

"Novel Healthcare Model, Continuation of Inequality: Exploring the Role of Micro Hospitals in Texas Healthcare Access Through Demographic Spatial Modeling",https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/ev6r2,"Purpose: Micro hospitals are a new form of for-profit healthcare facility with rapid expansion in some parts of the country. They continue to grow in Texas without in-depth public understanding or explicit policy guidance on their role in the healthcare system. Our project aims to define socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of areas served by micro and regular hospitals, and by doing so assess micro hospitals’ impact in expanding healthcare access for disadvantaged populations in Texas.Methodology/Approach: We 1) estimated hospital service areas (catchment areas) with a spatial model based on advanced Geographic Information System (GIS) methods using a proprietary ESRI traffic network; 2) assigned population socioeconomic measures to the catchment areas from the 2014–2018 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, weighted with an empirically tested Gaussian distribution; 3) used two-tailed t-tests to compare means of population characteristics between micro and regular hospital catchment areas, and 4) conducted logistic regressions to examine relationships between selected population variables and the associated odds of micro hospital presence.Findings: We found micro hospitals in Texas tend to serve a population less stressed in healthcare access compared to those who are more in need as measured by various dimensions of disadvantages.Research Limitations/Implications: Our analysis takes a cross sectional look at the population characteristics of micro hospital service areas. Even though the initial geographic choices of micro hospitals may not reflect the long-term population changes in specific neighborhoods, our analysis can provide policy makers a tool to examine healthcare access for disadvantaged populations at given point in time. As the population socioeconomic characteristics have long been associated with healthcare inequality, we hope our analysis will help foster structural policy considerations that balance growing healthcare delivery innovations and their social accountability.Originality/Value of Paper: We used GIS based spatial modeling to dynamically capture the potential patient basis by travel time calculated with a street network dataset rather than using the traditional static census tract to define hospital service areas. By mapping these boundaries in space we illustrated patterns that regression alone might not. Most importantly, by integrating both spatial and nonspatial dimensions of healthcare access, we demonstrated that the policy considerations on the implications of equal opportunity for healthcare access need to take into account the social realities for those experiencing the most vulnerability in our society, rather than a conceptual “equality” existing in the spatial and market abstraction.",2022,2022-09-15,0,"{'Ryan Earl', 'Ernesto F.

Automation and the Workforce: A Firm-Level View from the 2019 Annual Business Survey,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4282509,"This paper describes the adoption of automation technologies by US firms across all economic sectors by leveraging a new module introduced in the 2019 Annual Business Survey, conducted by the US Census Bureau in partnership with the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES). The module collects data from over 300,000 firms on the use of five advanced technologies: AI, robotics, dedicated equipment, specialized software, and cloud computing. The adoption of these technologies remains low (especially for AI and robotics), varies substantially across industries, and concentrates on large and young firms. However, because larger firms are much more likely to adopt them, 12-64% of US workers and 22-72% of manufacturing workers are exposed to these technologies. Firms report a variety of motivations for adoption, including automating tasks previously performed by labor. Consistent with the use of these technologies for automation, adopters have higher labor productivity and lower labor shares. In particular, the use of these technologies is associated with a 11.4% higher labor productivity, which accounts for 20-30% of the difference in labor productivity between large firms and the median firm in an industry. Adopters report that these technologies raised skill requirements and led to greater demand for skilled labor but brought limited or ambiguous effects to their employment levels.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",2022,2022-01-01,51,"{'Pascual Restrepo', 'Nikolas Zolas', 'David N.

Gross Job Flows for the U.S. Manufacturing Sector: Measurement from the Longitudinal Research Database,,"Measures of job creation and destruction are now produced regularly by the U.S. statistical agencies. The Bureau of Labor Statistics releases via the Business Employment Dynamics (BED) on a quarterly basis measures of job creation and destruction for the U.S. nonfarm business sector and related disaggregation by industrial sector and size class. The U.S. Census Bureau has developed the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) covering the nonfarm business sector that has been used to produce research analysis and special tabulations including tabulations of job creation and destruction. Both of these data programs build upon the measurement methods and data analysis of job creation and destruction measures from the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) developed and published by Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1996). In this paper, the LRD based estimates of job creation and destruction are updated and made available for consistent annual and quarterly series from 1972-1998. While the BED and LBD programs are more comprehensive in scope than the LRD, the extensive development of the LRD permits the construction of measures of job creation and destruction for a rich array of employer characteristics including industry, size, business age, ownership structure, location and wage structure. The updated series that are released with this working paper provide measures along each of these dimensions.

Published Versus Sample Statistics From The ASM: Implications For The LRD,,"In principle, the Longitudinal Research Database ( LRD ) which links the establishments in the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) is ideal for examining the dynamics of firm and aggregate behavior. However, the published ASM aggregates are not simply the appropriately weighted sums of establishment data in the LRD . Instead, the published data equal the sum of LRD-based sample estimates and nonsample estimates. The latter reflect adjustments related to sampling error and the imputation of small-establishment data. Differences between the LRD and the ASM raise questions for users of both data sets. For ASM users, time-series variation in the difference indicates potential problems in consistently and reliably estimating the nonsample portion of the ASM. For LRD users, potential sample selection problems arise due to the systematic exclusion of data from small establishments. Microeconomic studies based on the LRD can yield misleading inferences to the extent that small establishments behave differently. Similarly, new economic aggregates constructed from the LRD can yield incorrect estimates of levels and growth rates. This paper documents cross-sectional and time-series differences between ASM and LRD estimates of levels and growth rates of total employment, and compares them with employment estimates provided by Bureau of Labor Statistics and County Business Patterns data. In addition, this paper explores potential adjustments to economic aggregates constructed from the LRD. In particular, the paper reports the results of adjusting LRD-based estimates of gross job creation and destruction to be consistent with net job changes implied by the published ASM figures.",1991,1991-01-01,18,"{'Steven J.

Who Creates Jobs? Small vs. Large vs. Young,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1666157,"There's been a long, sometimes heated, debate on the role of firm size in employment growth. Despite skepticism in the academic community, the notion that growth is negatively related to firm size remains appealing to policymakers and small business advocates. The widespread and repeated claim from this community is that most new jobs are created by small businesses. Using data from the Census Bureau Business Dynamics Statistics and Longitudinal Business Database, we explore the many issues regarding the role of firm size and growth that have been at the core of this ongoing debate (such as the role of regression to the mean). We find that the relationship between firm size and employment growth is sensitive to these issues. However, our main finding is that once we control for firm age there is no systematic relationship between firm size and growth. Our findings highlight the important role of business startups and young businesses in U.S. job creation. Business startups contribute substantially to both gross and net job creation. In addition, we find an ""up or out"" dynamic of young firms. These findings imply that it is critical to control for and understand the role of firm age in explaining U.S. job creation.",2010,2010-01-01,127,"{'Javier Miranda', 'Ron S.

"The Relation among Human Capital, Productivity, and Market Value: Building Up from Micro Evidence",,"This paper investigates and evaluates the direct and indirect contribution of human capital to business productivity and shareholder value. The impact of human capital may occur in two ways: the specific knowledge of workers at businesses may directly increase business performance, or a skilled workforce may also indirectly act as a complement to improved technologies, business models or organizational practices. We use newly created firm-level measures of workforce human capital and productivity to examine links between those measures and the market value of the employing firm. The new human capital measures come from an integrated employer-employee data base under development at the US Census Bureau. We link these data to financial information from Compustat at the firm level, which provides measures of market value and tangible assets. The combination of these two sources permits examination of the link between human capital, productivity, and market value. There is a substantial positive relation between human capital and market value that is primarily related to the unmeasured personal characteristics of the employees, which are captured by the new measures.",2005,2005-08-12,83,"{'John M.

Automation and the Workforce: A Firm-Level View from the 2019 Annual Business Survey,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4282509,"This paper describes the adoption of automation technologies by US firms across all economic sectors by leveraging a new module introduced in the 2019 Annual Business Survey, conducted by the US Census Bureau in partnership with the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES). The module collects data from over 300,000 firms on the use of five advanced technologies: AI, robotics, dedicated equipment, specialized software, and cloud computing. The adoption of these technologies remains low (especially for AI and robotics), varies substantially across industries, and concentrates on large and young firms. However, because larger firms are much more likely to adopt them, 12-64% of US workers and 22-72% of manufacturing workers are exposed to these technologies. Firms report a variety of motivations for adoption, including automating tasks previously performed by labor. Consistent with the use of these technologies for automation, adopters have higher labor productivity and lower labor shares. In particular, the use of these technologies is associated with a 11.4% higher labor productivity, which accounts for 20-30% of the difference in labor productivity between large firms and the median firm in an industry. Adopters report that these technologies raised skill requirements and led to greater demand for skilled labor but brought limited or ambiguous effects to their employment levels.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",2022,2022-01-01,51,"{'Pascual Restrepo', 'Nikolas Zolas', 'David N.

"Gross Job Creation, Gross Job Destruction and Employment Reallocation",,"This paper measures the heterogeneity of establishment-level employment changes in the U.S. manufacturing sector over the 1972 to 1986 period. Our empirical work exploits a rich data set with approximately 860,000 annual observations on 160,000 manufacturing establishments to calculate rates of gross job creation, gross job destruction, and their sum, gross job reallocation. The central empirical findings are as follows: (1) Based on March-to-March establishment-level employment changes, gross job reallocation averages more than 20% of employment per year. (2) For the manufacturing sector as a whole, March-to-March gross job reallocation varies over time from 17% to 23% of employment per year. (3) Time variation in gross job reallocation is countercyclic-gross job reallocation rates covary negatively with own-sector and manufacturing net employment growth rates. (4) Virtually all of the time variation in gross job reallocation is accounted for by idiosyncratic effects on the establishment growth rate density. Changes in the shape and location of the growth rate density due to aggregate-year effects and sector-year effects cannot explain the observed variation in gross job reallocation. (5) The part of gross job reallocation attributable to idiosyncratic effects fluctuates countercyclically. Combining (3) – (5), we conclude that the intensity of shifts in the pattern of employment opportunities across establishments exhibits significant countercyclic variation.

This research reveals large and persistent productivity differences across businesses, even within narrowly defined industries. These differences vary by industry and time and are related to productivityenhancing reallocation. Dispersion in productivity across businesses can provide information about the nature of competition and frictions within sectors, and about the sources of rising wage inequality across businesses. Because there were no official statistics providing this level of detail, BLS and the Census Bureau partnered to create measures of within-industry productivity dispersion. These measures complement official BLS aggregate industry-level productivity growth statistics and thereby improve our understanding of the rich productivity dynamics in the U.S. economy.

We particularly focus on the decision making process of new firms and examine the role of both learning and selection.

(ii) We find that new businesses exhibit even greater heterogeneity in earnings and productivity than do mature businesses, but that they adjust to the mature business pattern as they age. The adjustment process, while different for earnings and productivity, is consistent both with firms learning as they age and with the exit of mistake' prone firms.

These statistics cannot, however, tell us about the variation in productivity levels across establishments within those industries. Dispersion in productivity across businesses can provide information about the nature of competition and frictions within sectors and the sources of rising wage inequality across businesses. DiSP data show enormous differences in productivity across establishments within industries in the manufacturing sector. We find substantial variation in dispersion across industries, increasing dispersion from 1997 to 2016, and countercyclical total factor productivity dispersion. We hope DiSP will enable further research into understanding productivity differences across industries and establishments and over time.",2022,2022-09-26,12,"{'Cindy Cunningham', 'Cheryl Grim', 'Zoltán Wolf', 'Jay Stewart', 'Lucia Foster', 'Sabrina Wulff Pabilonia', 'John Haltiwanger'}",Bureau of Labor Statistics; United States Census Bureau; United States Census Bureau; Bureau of Labor Statistics; Bureau of Labor Statistics; New Light Industries (United States),Firm Innovation and Growth; Global trade and economics; Regional Economics and Spatial Analysis,Review of Income and Wealth,article,John C Haltiwanger,https://openalex.org/A5010043276,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) T26 Components - 2014; Service Annual Survey; Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Baruch

Who Creates Jobs? Small vs. Large vs. Young,,"The view that small businesses create the most jobs remains appealing to policymakers and small business advocates. Using data from the Census Bureau Business Dynamics Statistics and Longitudinal Business Database, we explore the many issues at the core of this ongoing debate. We find that the relationship between firm size and employment growth is sensitive to these issues.

Don't Quit Your Day Job: Using Wage and Salary Earnings to Support a New Business,,"This paper makes use of a newly constructed Census Bureau dataset that follows the universe of sole proprietors, employers and non-employers, over 10 years and links their transitions to their activity as employees earning wage and salary income. By combining administrative data on sole proprietors and their businesses with quarterly administrative data on wage and salary jobs held by the same individuals both preceding and concurrent with business startup, we create the unique opportunity to quantify significant workforce dynamics that have up to now remained unobserved. The data allow us to take a first glimpse at these business owners as they initiate business ventures and make the transition from wage and salary work to business ownership and back. We find that the barrier between wage and salary work and self-employment is extremely fluid, with large flows occurring in both directions. We also observe that a large fraction of business owners takeon both roles simultaneously and find that this labor market diversification does have implications for the success of the businesses these owners create. The results for employer transitions to exit and non-employer suggest that there is a ”don’t quit your day job” effect that is present for new businesses. Employers are more likely to stay employers if they have a wage and salary job in the year just prior to the transitions that we are tracking. It is especially important to have a stable wage and salary job but there is also evidence that higher earnings from the wage and salary job makes transition less likely. For nonemployers we find roughly similar patterns but there are some key differences. We find that having recent wage and salary income (and having higher earnings from such wage and salary activity) increases the likelihood of survival. Having recent stable wage and salary income decreases the likelihood of a complete exit but increases the likelihood of transiting to be an employer.

Second, this decline is particularly pronounced among young and small firms, while the share of high-growth firms has been relatively stable among large and old firms.

Our new aggregate measures are generated by linking American Community Survey data with the universe of IRS 1040 tax returns. In both fixed effects and IV models using a Bartik-style instrument, we find that entrepreneurship increases income inequality. Further, we find that this increase in income inequality arises due to the fact that almost all of the individual gains associated with increased entrepreneurship accrue to the top 10 percent of the income distribution. While we find mixed evidence for small positive effects of entrepreneurship lower on the income distribution, we find little if any evidence that entrepreneurship increases income mobility.",2019,2019-01-01,8,"{'John Voorheis', 'Astrid Marinoni'}",,Entrepreneurship Studies and Influences; Labor market dynamics and wage inequality; Firm Innovation and Growth,RePEc: Research Papers in Economics,preprint,John L Voorheis,https://openalex.org/A5045851914,American Community Survey; BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),American Community Survey,Michigan
"Air Quality, Human Capital Formation and the Long-term Effects of Environmental Inequality at Birth",,"A growing body of literature suggests that pollution exposure early in life can have substantial long term effects on an individual’s economic well-being as an adult, however the mechanisms for these effects remain unclear. I contribute to this literature by examining the effect of pollution exposure on several intermediate determinants of adult wages using a unique linked dataset for a large sample of individuals from two cohorts: an older cohort born around the 1970, and a younger cohort born around 1990. This dataset links responses to the American Community Survey to SSA administrative data, the universe of IRS Form 1040 tax returns, pollution concentration data from EPA air quality monitors and satellite remote sensing observations. In both OLS and IV specifications, I find that pollution exposure at birth has a large and economically significant effect on college attendance among 19-22 year olds. Using conventional estimates of the college wage premium, these effects imply that a 10 µg/m3 decrease in particulate matter exposure at birth is associated with a $190 per year increase in annual wages. This effect is smaller than the wage effects in the previous literature, which suggests that human capital acquisition associated with cognitive skills cannot fully explain the long term wage effects of pollution exposure. Indeed, I find evidence for an additional channel working through non-cognitive skill -pollution exposure at birth increases high school non-completion and incarceration among 16-24 year olds, and that these effects are concentrated within disadvantaged communities, with larger effects for non-whites and children of poor parents. I also find that pollution exposure during adolescence has statistically significant effects on high school non-completion and incarceration, but no effect on college attendance. These results suggest that the long term effects of pollution exposure on economic well-being may run through multiple channels, of which both non-cognitive skills and cognitive skills may play a role.",2017,2017-05-01,12,{'John Voorheis'},,"Air Quality and Health Impacts; Fiscal Policy and Economic Growth; Energy, Environment, Economic Growth",RePEc: Research Papers in Economics,preprint,John L Voorheis,https://openalex.org/A5045851914,American Community Survey; BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),American Community Survey,Michigan

Correctional Facility and Inmate Locations: Urban and Rural Status Patterns,,"As the incarcerated population grew from the 1980s through the late 2000s, so too did the number of correctional facilities. An increasing number of these facilities have been constructed in rural areas. While research has shown there has been growth in prisons and prisoners in rural areas, there are no recent national-level statistics regarding the urban-rural status of correctional facilities and inmates, the urban-rural status of inmates prior to prison, or an accounting of how many inmates from urban or rural areas are incarcerated in urban and rural facilities. Using 2010 decennial census and Bureau of Justice Statistics’ 2004 Survey of Prison Inmates data we describe these patterns. We find that a disproportionate share of prisons and inmates are located in rural areas, while a disproportionate share of inmates are from urban areas.

What Caused Racial Disparities in Particulate Exposure to Fall? New Evidence from the Clean Air Act and Satellite-Based Measures of Air Quality,,"Racial differences in exposure to ambient air pollution have declined significantly in the United States over the past 20 years. This project links restricted-access Census Bureau microdata to newly available, spatially continuous high resolution measures of ambient particulate pollution (PM2.5) to examine the underlying causes and consequences of differences in black-white pollution exposures. We begin by decomposing differences in pollution exposure into components explained by observable population characteristics (e.g., income) versus those that remain unexplained. We then use quantile regression methods to show that a significant portion of the unexplained convergence in black-white pollution exposure can be attributed to differential impacts of the Clean Air Act (CAA) in non-Hispanic African American and non-Hispanic white communities. Areas with larger black populations saw greater CAA-related declines in PM2.5 exposure. We show that the CAA has been the single largest contributor to racial convergence in PM2.5 pollution exposure in the U.S. since 2000, accounting for over 60 percent of the reduction.

Jones, and Sonya R. Porter. For more information, see https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/the-opportunity-atlas/. A summary of the related publication follows. We construct a publicly available atlas of children’s outcomes in adulthood by Census tract using anonymized longitudinal data covering nearly the entire U.S. population. For each tract, we estimate children’s earnings distributions, incarceration rates, and other outcomes in adulthood by parental income, race, and gender. These estimates allow us to trace the roots of outcomes such as poverty and incarceration back to the neighborhoods in which children grew up. We find that children’s outcomes vary sharply across nearby tracts: for children of parents at the 25th percentile of the income distribution, the standard deviation of mean household income at age 35 is $5,000 across tracts within counties. We illustrate how these tract-level data can provide insight into how neighborhoods shape the development of human capital and support local economic policy using two applications. First, we show that the estimates permit precise targeting of policies to improve economic opportunity by uncovering specific neighborhoods where certain subgroups of children grow up to have poor outcomes. Neighborhoods matter at a very granular level: conditional on characteristics such as poverty rates in a child’s own Census tract, characteristics of tracts that are one mile away have little predictive power for a child’s outcomes. Our historical estimates are informative predictors of outcomes even for children growing up today because neighborhood conditions are relatively stable over time. Second, we show that the observational estimates are highly predictive of neighborhoods’ causal effects, based on a comparison to data from the Moving to Opportunity experiment and a quasi-experimental research design analyzing movers’ outcomes. We then identify high-opportunity neighborhoods that are affordable to low-income families, providing an input into the design of affordable housing policies. Our measures of children’s long-term outcomes are only weakly correlated with traditional proxies for local economic success such as rates of job growth, showing that the conditions that create greater upward mobility are not necessarily the same as those that lead to productive labor markets.

Replication Data for: A Practical Method to Reduce Privacy Loss when Disclosing Statistics Based on Small Samples,https://doi.org/10.7910/dvn/rchdxx,"This dataset contains replication files for ""A Practical Method to Reduce Privacy Loss when Disclosing Statistics Based on Small Samples"" by Raj Chetty and John Friedman. For more information, see https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/differential-privacy/. A summary of the related publication follows. Releasing statistics based on small samples – such as estimates of social mobility by Census tract, as in the Opportunity Atlas – is very valuable for policy but can potentially create privacy risks by unintentionally disclosing information about specific individuals. To mitigate such risks, we worked with researchers at the Harvard Privacy Tools Project and Census Bureau staff to develop practical methods of reducing the risks of privacy loss when releasing such data. This paper describes the methods that we developed, which can be applied to disclose any statistic of interest that is estimated using a sample with a small number of observations. We focus on the case where the dataset can be broken into many groups (“cells”) and one is interested in releasing statistics for one or more of these cells. Building on ideas from the differential privacy literature, we add noise to the statistic of interest in proportion to the statistic’s maximum observed sensitivity, defined as the maximum change in the statistic from adding or removing a single observation across all the cells in the data. Intuitively, our approach permits the release of statistics in arbitrarily small samples by adding sufficient noise to the estimates to protect privacy. Although our method does not offer a formal privacy guarantee, it generally outperforms widely used methods of disclosure limitation such as count-based cell suppression both in terms of privacy loss and statistical bias. We illustrate how the method can be implemented by discussing how it was used to release estimates of social mobility by Census tract in the Opportunity Atlas. We also provide a step-by-step guide and illustrative Stata code to implement our approach.",2022,2022-01-01,0,"{'John N.

"Block, Tract, and Levels of Aggregation: Neighborhood Structure and Crime and Disorder as a Case in Point",https://doi.org/10.1177/000312240707200501,"This article highlights the importance of considering the proper level of aggregation when estimating neighborhood effects. Using a unique nonrural subsample from a large national survey (the American Housing Survey) at three time points that allows placing respondents in blocks and census tracts, this study tests the appropriate level of aggregation of the structural characteristics hypothesized to affect block-level perceptions of crime and disorder. I find that structural characteristics differ in their effects based on the level of aggregation employed. While the effects of racial/ethnic heterogeneity are fairly robust to the geographical level of aggregation, the stronger effects, when measured at the level of the surrounding census tract, suggest more dispersed networks are important for perceived crime and disorder. In contrast, economic resources only show a localized effect when aggregating to the block-level and differ based on the outcome; higher average income reduces disorder but increases crime, most likely by increasing the number of attractive targets. Additionally, the presence of broken households has a localized effect for social disorder but a more diffuse effect for perceived crime. These findings suggest the need for neighborhood studies of crime rates, as well as the broader neighborhood effects literature, to consider the mechanisms involved when aggregating various structural characteristics.",2007,2007-10-01,396,{'John R.

Using a unique data set that links household-level data from the American Housing Survey metro samples over 25 years (1976-1999) with official crime rate data for census tracts in selected cities during selected years, this study finds that tract violent crime is the strongest predictor of residents’ perception of crime. This standardized coefficient was .71 on average over the seven waves. Models simultaneously taking into account both violent and property crime found a consistently strong positive effect for violent crime but a consistently negative effect for property crime. Among types of violent crime, robbery and aggravated assault have the strongest effect on the perception of crime in the tract.

THE ROLE OF CRIME IN HOUSING UNIT RACIAL/ETHNIC TRANSITION*,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2010.00199.x,"Previous research frequently has observed a positive cross‐sectional relationship between racial/ethnic minorities and crime and generally has posited that this relationship is entirely because of the effect of minorities on neighborhood crime rates. This study posits that at least some of this relationship might be a result of the opposite effect—neighborhood crime increases the number of racial/ethnic minorities. This study employs a unique sample (the American Housing Survey neighborhood sample) focusing on housing units nested in microneighborhoods across three waves from 1985 to 1993. This format allows one to test and find that such racial/ethnic transformation occurs because of the following effects: First, White households that perceive more crime in the neighborhood or that live in microneighborhoods with more commonly perceived crime are more likely to move out of such neighborhoods. Second, Whites are significantly less likely to move into a housing unit in a microneighborhood with more commonly perceived crime.

The spatial distribution of neighborhood safety ties: Consequences for perceived collective efficacy?,https://doi.org/10.1080/07352166.2023.2192940,"ABSTRACTABSTRACTThere is conflicting evidence in the literature regarding the relationship between residents’ social networks and their perceptions of neighborhood collective efficacy. This study proposes addressing this challenge with several theoretically motivated refinements using a large spatially stratified sample of residents in the Western United States. First, we consider various distinct types of social relationships, and find that our novel measure of neighborhood safety ties is much more strongly related to perceived collective efficacy than is a measure of socializing relationships. Second, we explicitly account for the spatial distribution of ties, and find that it is not just local neighborhood ties that increase a sense of cohesion or informal social control, but that more spatially distant ties also matter. Third, we make a distinction between urban and rural areas, finding that in rural areas, social ties from an even broader area are associated with stronger feelings of collective efficacy.KEYWORDS: Neighborhoodssocial networksspatial effectscollective efficacy Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Additional informationFundingThis research is supported in part by NSF grants [IIS-1526736 and BCS-0827027].Notes on contributorsJohn R.

The Uptick in Income Segregation: Real Trend or Random Sampling Variation?,https://doi.org/10.1086/697528,"Recent trends in income segregation in metropolitan regions show that, after a decline in the 1990s, there was an increase in 2000–2010 that reinforced concerns about the overall growth in U.S. income inequality since the 1970s. Yet the evidence may be systematically biased to exacerbate the upward trend because the effective sample for the American Community Survey (ACS) is much smaller than it was for the 2000 census to which it is being compared. Apparent changes in disparities across census tracts may result partly from a higher level of sampling variation and bias due to the smaller sample. This study uses 100% microdata from the 1940 census to simulate the impact of different sampling rates and applies those approaches to publicly available data for 2000 and 2007–11.

Models for Small Area Estimation for Census Tracts,https://doi.org/10.1111/gean.12215,"This study examines issues of Small Area Estimation that are raised by reliance on the American Community Survey (ACS), which reports tract‐level data based on much smaller samples than the decennial census long‐form that it replaced. We demonstrate the problem using a 100% transcription of microdata from the 1940 census. By drawing many samples from two major cities, we confirm a known pattern: random samples yield unbiased point estimates of means or proportions, but estimates based on smaller samples have larger average errors in measurement and greater risk of large error. Sampling variability also inflates estimates of measures of variation across areas (reflecting segregation or spatial inequality). This variation is at the heart of much contemporary spatial analysis. We then evaluate possible solutions. For point estimates, we examine three Bayesian models, all of which reduce sampling variation, and we encourage use of such models to correct ACS small area estimates. However, the corrected estimates cannot be used to calculate estimates of variation, because smoothing toward local or grand means artificially reduces variation. We note that there are potential Bayesian approaches to this problem, and we demonstrate an efficacious alternative that uses the original sample data.",2019,2019-07-10,8,"{'John Logan', 'Cici Bauer', 'Hongwei Xu', 'Jun Ke', 'Fan Li'}","Brown University; The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston; Brown University; Queens College, CUNY; Yale University",Spatial and Panel Data Analysis; demographic modeling and climate adaptation; Housing Market and Economics,Geographical Analysis,article,John R Logan,https://openalex.org/A5048869586,American Community Survey; Census Bureau; Baruch RDC; BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),American Community Survey,Baruch
"Validating Population Estimates for Harmonized Census Tract Data, 2000–2010",https://doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2016.1187060,"Social scientists regularly rely on population estimates when studying change in small areas over time. Census tract data in the United States are a prime example, as there are substantial shifts in tract boundaries from decade to decade. This study compares alternative estimates of the 2000 population living within 2010 tract boundaries to the Census Bureau's own retabulation. All methods of estimation are subject to error; this is the first study to directly quantify the error in alternative interpolation methods for U.S. census tracts. A simple areal weighting method closely approximates the estimates provided by one standard source (the Neighborhood Change Data Base), with some improvement provided by considering only area not covered by water. More information is used by the Longitudinal Tract Data Base (LTDB), which relies on a combination of areal and population interpolation as well as ancillary data about water-covered areas. Another set of estimates provided by the National Historical Geographic Information Systems (NHGIS) uses data about land cover in 2001 and the current road network and distribution of population and housing units at the block level. Areal weighting alone results in a large error in a substantial share of tracts that were divided in complex ways. The LTDB and NHGIS perform much better in all situations but are subject to some error when boundaries of both tracts and their component blocks are redrawn. Users of harmonized tract data should be watchful for potential problems in either of these data sources.",2016,2016-06-17,72,"{'John Logan', 'Zengwang Xu', 'Brian J.

Interpolating U.S. Decennial Census Tract Data from as Early as 1970 to 2010: A Longitudinal Tract Database,https://doi.org/10.1080/00330124.2014.905156,"Differences in the reporting units of data from diverse sources and changes in units over time are common obstacles to analysis of areal data. We compare common approaches to this problem in the context of changes over time in the boundaries of U.S. census tracts. In every decennial census many tracts are split, consolidated, or changed in other ways from the previous boundaries to reflect population growth or decline. We examine two interpolation methods to create a bridge between years, one that relies only on areal weighting and another that also introduces population weights. Results demonstrate that these approaches produce substantially different estimates for variables that involve population counts, but they have a high degree of convergence for variables defined as rates or averages. Finally the paper describes the Longitudinal Tract Data Base (LTDB), through which we are making available public-use tools to implement these methods to create estimates within 2010 tract boundaries for any tract-level data (from the census or other sources) that are available for prior years as early as 1970.",2014,2014-05-13,405,"{'John Logan', 'Zengwang Xu', 'Brian J.

Models for Small Area Estimation for Census Tracts,https://doi.org/10.1111/gean.12215,"This study examines issues of Small Area Estimation that are raised by reliance on the American Community Survey (ACS), which reports tract‐level data based on much smaller samples than the decennial census long‐form that it replaced. We demonstrate the problem using a 100% transcription of microdata from the 1940 census. By drawing many samples from two major cities, we confirm a known pattern: random samples yield unbiased point estimates of means or proportions, but estimates based on smaller samples have larger average errors in measurement and greater risk of large error. Sampling variability also inflates estimates of measures of variation across areas (reflecting segregation or spatial inequality). This variation is at the heart of much contemporary spatial analysis. We then evaluate possible solutions. For point estimates, we examine three Bayesian models, all of which reduce sampling variation, and we encourage use of such models to correct ACS small area estimates. However, the corrected estimates cannot be used to calculate estimates of variation, because smoothing toward local or grand means artificially reduces variation. We note that there are potential Bayesian approaches to this problem, and we demonstrate an efficacious alternative that uses the original sample data.",2019,2019-07-10,8,"{'John Logan', 'Cici Bauer', 'Hongwei Xu', 'Jun Ke', 'Fan Li'}","Brown University; The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston; Brown University; Queens College, CUNY; Yale University",Spatial and Panel Data Analysis; demographic modeling and climate adaptation; Housing Market and Economics,Geographical Analysis,article,John R Logan,https://openalex.org/A5048869586,BOC Master Address File Auxiliary Reference File (MAFARF); Disclosure Avoidance Population Tables; Decennial Census,Decennial Census,Baruch

A New Residual Approach for Estimating Undocumented Populations,https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183231195280,"Demographers generally agree that the total undocumented population in the United States increased from 3.5 million in 1990 to about 12 million in 2008 and declined from 2008 to 2010. The consensus breaks down after 2010, however, with three of the five organizations that derive annual estimates of the population showing increases from 2010 to 2018 and two organizations reporting substantial declines over the period. The primary reason for this divergence is that organizations use a variety of estimates of emigration of legal residents, and in some cases the data are decades out of date. Reliable information about trends in this population is important for developing legislative and administrative policies to reduce the population and for assessing the effectiveness of enforcement efforts. This research note describes an improved residual method for updating annual estimates of the undocumented population counted in the American Community Survey (ACS; Ruggles et al. 2022); the method incorporates a time-varying estimate of emigration.

The differences in teacher pay across states also greatly narrow with the adjustments.

An Anatomy of Racial and Ethnic Trends in Male Earnings,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2139024,"Progress in narrowing black-white earnings differences has been far from continuous, with some of the apparent progress resulting from labor force withdrawal among lower-skilled African Americans. This paper builds on prior research and documents racial and ethnic differences in male earnings from 1950 through 2010 using data from the decennial census and American Community Surveys. Emphasis is given to annual rather than weekly or hourly earnings. Treatment of imputed earnings greatly affects measured outcomes. We take a quantile approach, providing evidence on medians and other percentiles of the distribution.

Access to childcare may also affect their labor force decisions.Using American Community Survey microdata, we examine how birth-place residence, a proxy for access to extended family and child care, relates to self-employment and hours worked for college-graduate married mothers. Our results suggest that flexibility is a major factor pulling out-migrant college-educated mothers into self-employment.

"Motherhood, Migration, and Self-Employment of College Graduates",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3390134,"Women face unique challenges in starting and running their own businesses and may have differing motives to men for pursuing self-employment. Previous research suggests that married women with families value the flexibility that self-employment can offer, allowing them to balance their family responsibilities with their career aspirations. This may be especially true for college graduates, who tend to have more successful businesses. Access to childcare may also affect their labor force decisions.Using American Community Survey microdata, we examine how birth-place residence, a proxy for access to extended family and child care, relates to self-employment and hours worked for college-graduate married mothers. Our results suggest that flexibility is a major factor pulling out-migrant college-educated mothers into self-employment. Additionally, it appears that, in response to fewer childcare options, self-employed mothers away from their birth-place work fewer hours, while self-employed mothers residing in their birth place are able to work more hours per week.",2019,2019-01-01,0,"{'John V.

First, the share of firms that are high-growth has steadily decreased over the past four decades, driven not only by falling rates of entrepreneurship but also languishing growth among existing firms. Second, this decline is particularly pronounced among young and small firms, while the share of high-growth firms has been relatively stable among large and old firms.

Trends in Minority Commuting Behavior: What Does the American Community Survey Tell Us?,,"Two currently important aspects of transportation research are addressed in this paper, the changing nature of travel behavior among the growing minority groups and the potential utility of the American Community Survey (ACS) as an emerging source of travel information. With minority groups growing in population (the Chicago metropolitan area is projected to be more than half ‘minority’ by 2030), the commuting patterns and trends of this population need close examination. We find that, overall, minorities have higher travel times to work, but in suburban Chicago they have lower travel times. We now have sufficient data in the ACS to make this assessment and address some of the key questions regarding commuting behavior. We find that the ACS data for Illinois, from 2000 to 2003, reveals only a few short-term trends, such as growing minority populations and increasing tendency to drive to work, but that the travel times and mode use have not changed substantially throughout the study period, 2000-2003. These findings support the intent of the US Census Bureau to aggregate several years of data, at increased sample sizes, so that researchers and planners alike may study patterns and trend at small levels of geographic detail. At the same time, caution needs to be exercised in analyzing aggregate data for variables that exhibit change over time. The key here is the change over short periods of time, five years, rather than long-term changes that are common in travel behavior.",2006,2006-01-01,0,"{'S Sööt', 'Joost Gideon Berman'}",,"Urban Transport and Accessibility; Transportation Planning and Optimization; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies",Transportation Research Board 85th Annual MeetingTransportation Research Board,article,Joost G Berman,https://openalex.org/A5057071957,American Community Survey; Chicago RDC; FSRDC; American Community Survey Unedited Microdata; Census Bureau,American Community Survey; Census Bureau,Chicago
Immigrant Legal Status among Essential Frontline Workers in the United States during the COVID-19 Pandemic Era,https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183221127277,"Emerging evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has extracted a substantial toll on immigrant communities in the United States, due in part to increased potential risk of exposure for immigrants to COVID-19 in the workplace. In this article, we use federal guidance on which industries in the United States were designated essential during the COVID-19 pandemic, information about the ability to work remotely, and data from the 2019 American Community Survey to estimate the distribution of essential frontline workers by nativity and immigrant legal status. Central to our analysis is a proxy measure of working in the primary or secondary sector of the segmented labor market. Our results indicate that a larger proportion of foreign-born workers are essential frontline workers compared to native-born workers and that 70 percent of unauthorized immigrant workers are essential frontline workers. Disparities in essential frontline worker status are most pronounced for unauthorized immigrant workers and native-born workers in the secondary sector of the labor market. These results suggest that larger proportions of foreign-born workers, and especially unauthorized immigrant workers, face greater risk of potential exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace than native-born workers. Social determinants of health such as lack of access to health insurance and living in overcrowded housing indicate that unauthorized immigrant essential frontline workers may be more vulnerable to poor health outcomes related to COVID-19 than other groups of essential frontline workers.

Here, we evaluate the current geographic adjustment of the SPM using both microdata and aggregate data from the American Community Survey for 2014-2018. By comparing housing costs, tenure, and commuting, we determine median rent is likely an appropriate basis for geographic adjustment. However, by demonstrating the wide variability between median rents of non-metropolitan counties within the same state, we show that the current operationalization of this geographic adjustment is sorely lacking.",2021,2021-05-26,2,"{'José Pacas', 'Matthew M.

Some Suggestions for Improving CFS Data Products,,"The Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) collects data on the movement of goods in the United States and the District of Columbia. It provides information on commodities shipped, their value, weight, and mode of transportation (air, motor carrier, rail, water and pipeline and intermodal combinations). To a certain extent, the origin and destination (O-D) of shipments of mining, manufacturing, wholesale trade and selected retail establishments are covered. Analysts and researchers in both the public and private arena use data from the CFS. However, CFS data are often inadequate because of gaps in shipment and industry coverage, the lack of geographic and commodity flow detail at state and local levels, lack of international flows, and the inability to capture rapid changes in economic and global trade cycles. On average, the CFS data (1993, 1997) were released 3 years after it was collected. As a result, the CFS must be supplemented with data from other sources or models to support analysis and mapping of spatial commodity flow patterns. The purpose of this discussion is to examine some alternative data collection, packaging, and products that may improve the usefulness of the CFS by understanding the data issues that transportation professionals expect the CFS to fulfill. In this way it may be possible to both alter what is collected and how data should be packaged to better serve the CFS end user. The paper starts with a brief summary of the Saratoga Freight Data Needs Conference because its findings provide a rather compact definition of freight data needs as perceived by a wide spectrum of users. Then, the paper focuses on identifying the expectations of CFS users (section III). Subsequent sections discuss ways to improve the CFS data products from different perspectives: within the current CFS structure (section IV), by adopting combinations of selective statistical aggregation and improving linkages to other data products (section V), by taking advantage of and fostering freight transportation research (section VI), and finally by defining the kind of data products the freight transportation modeling community would like to have. For the most part, the authors have focused on data needs for the most demanding of users, referred to here as “power users,” which are the ones that make intensive use of the CFS for both modeling and policy analyses.

Estimating the Payoff to Schooling Using the Vietnam-Era Draft Lottery,,"During the Vietnam draft priority for military service was randomly assigned to draft-age men in a series of lotteries. However, many men managed to avoid military service by enrolling in school and obtaining an educational deferment. This paper uses the draft lottery as a natural experiment to estimate the return to education and the veteran premium. Estimates are based on special extracts of the Current Population Survey that the Census Bureau assembled for 1979 and 1981-85. The results suggest that an extra year of schooling acquired in response to the lottery is associated with 6.6 percent higher weekly earnings. This figure is about 10 percent higher the OLS estimate of the return to education for this sample, which suggests there is little ability bias in conventional estimates of the return to education. Our findings are robust to a variety of alternative assumptions about the effect of veteran status on earnings.",1991,1991-08-01,1,"{'Joshua D. Angrist', 'Alan B.

WHY DO ENERGY PRICES MATTER? THE ROLE OF INTERINDUSTRY LINKAGES IN U.S. MANUFACTURING,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1465-7295.2008.00168.x,"There is considerable empirical evidence that energy prices had a large effect on the U.S. economy between World War II and the 1980s. This paper argues that linkages between manufacturing industries amplify the effect of an energy price shock and help explain the large effect. In particular, energy‐intensive industries are important input suppliers to other industries. When the price of energy increases, energy‐intensive industries contract, raising materials prices for other industries. Because of the reduction in materials supply, the downstream industries also contract, which I refer to as the supply effect. Using data from the Census of Manufactures, I find that the supply effect accounted for about one half of the sensitivity of value added to the price of energy. I use plant‐level census data to show that the supply effect caused similar changes in value added per plant as in value added per industry. A price increase caused a small, although statistically significant, decrease in entry and had no effect on exit. Finally, the supply effect reduced plant‐level labor demand .

Energy Prices and the Adoption of Energy-Saving Technology,,"This paper investigates the link between factor prices, technology and factor demands. I estimate the effect of price-induced technology adoption on energy demand in the U.S. manufacturing sector, using plant data from the Census of Manufactures, 1963-1997. I compare the energy efficiency of entrants and incumbents to measure the effect of technology adoption on the demand for energy. A 10 percent increase in the price of energy causes technology adoption that reduces the energy demand of entrants by 1 percent. This elasticity has two implications: first, technology adoption explains a statistically significant but relatively small fraction of changes in energy demand in the 1970s and 1980s; and second, technology adoption can reduce the long run effect of energy prices on growth, but by less than previous research has found.",2006,2006-04-01,1,{'Joshua Linn'},University of Illinois Chicago,"Energy, Environment, Economic Growth; Energy, Environment, and Transportation Policies; Climate Change Policy and Economics",RePEc: Research Papers in Economics,preprint,Joshua Linn,https://openalex.org/A5102996154,Census of Manufactures; Chicago RDC; Compustat-SSEL Bridge; Annual Survey of Manufactures; FSRDC,Census of Manufactures,Chicago
"Concentration, Diversity, and Manufacturing Performance",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1649462,"Regional economist Benjamin Chinitz was one of the most successful proponents of the idea that regional industrial structure is an important determinant of economic performance. His influential article in the American Economic Review in 1961 prompted substantial research measuring industrial structure at the regional scale and examining its relationships to economic outcomes. A considerable portion of this work operationalized the concept of regional industrial structure as sectoral diversity, the degree to which the composition of an economy is spread across heterogeneous activities. Diversity is a relatively simple construct to measure and interpret, but does not capture the implications of Chinitz’s ideas fully. The structure within regional industries may also influence the performance of business enterprises. In particular, regional intra-industry concentration - the extent to which an industry is dominated by a few relatively large firms in a locality - has not appeared in empirical work studying economic performance apart from individual case studies, principally because accurately measuring concentration within a regional industry requires firm-level information. Multiple establishments of varying sizes in a given locality may be part of the same firm. Therefore, secondary data sources on establishment size distributions (such as County Business Patterns or aggregated information from the Census of Manufactures) can yield only deceptive portrayals of the level of regional industrial concentration. This paper uses the Longitudinal Research Database, a confidential establishment-level dataset compiled by the United States Census Bureau, to compare the influences of industrial diversity and intra-industry concentration upon regional and firm-level economic outcomes.",2010,2010-01-01,3,{'Joshua Drucker'},University of Illinois Chicago,Regional Economics and Spatial Analysis; Economic Growth and Productivity; Firm Innovation and Growth,SSRN Electronic Journal,article,Joshua M Drucker,https://openalex.org/A5011423120,Ownership Change Database; Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File; Census of Manufactures,Census of Manufactures,Triangle

This paper examines how industrial concentration and agglomeration economies impact plant performance, focusing on the influence of establishment size in mediating these effects. The Longitudinal Research Database of the U.S. Census Bureau is accessed to construct production functions for three manufacturing industries nationwide.

"Concentration, diversity, and manufacturing performance.",,"Regional economist Benjamin Chinitz was one of the most successful proponents of the idea that regional industrial structure is an important determinant of economic performance. His influential article in the American Economic Review in 1961 prompted substantial research measuring industrial structure at the regional scale and examining its relationships to economic outcomes. A considerable portion of this work operationalized the concept of regional industrial structure as sectoral diversity, the degree to which the composition of an economy is spread across heterogeneous activities. Diversity is a relatively simple construct to measure and interpret, but does not capture the implications of Chinitz’s ideas fully. The structure within regional industries may also influence the performance of business enterprises. In particular, regional intra-industry concentration—the extent to which an industry is dominated by a few relatively large firms in a locality—has not appeared in empirical work studying economic performance apart from individual case studies, principally because accurately measuring concentration within a regional industry requires firm-level information. Multiple establishments of varying sizes in a given locality may be part of the same firm. Therefore, secondary data sources on establishment size distributions (such as County Business Patterns or aggregated information from the Census of Manufactures) can yield only deceptive portrayals of the level of regional industrial concentration. This paper uses the Longitudinal Research Database, a confidential establishment-level dataset compiled by the United States Census Bureau, to compare the influences of industrial diversity and intra-industry concentration upon regional and firm-level economic outcomes. Manufacturing establishments are aggregated into firms and several indicators of regional industrial concentration are calculated at multiple levels of industrial aggregation. These concentration indicators, along with a regional sectoral diversity measure, are related to employment change over time and incorporated into plant productivity estimations, in order to examine and distinguish the relationships between the differing aspects of regional industrial structure and economic performance. A better understanding of the particular links between regional industrial structure and economic performance can be used to improve economic development planning efforts. With continuing economic restructuring and associated workforce dislocation in the United States and worldwide, industrial concentration and over-specialization are separate mechanisms by which regions may “lock in” to particular competencies and limit the capacity to adjust quickly and efficiently to changing markets and technologies. The most appropriate and effective policies for improving economic adaptability should reflect the structural characteristics that limit flexibility.

"How does size matter? Investigating the relationships among plant size, industrial structure, and manufacturing productivity.",,"Industrial concentration and market power have been studied extensively at the national scale, in fields ranging from economics and industrial organization to regional science and economic development. At the regional scale, however, industrial structure and firm size relationships have received little attention outside of non-generalizable case studies, primarily because accurate measurements require difficult-to-obtain plant- or firm-level information. Readily available secondary data sources on establishment size distributions (such as County Business Patterns or the Census of Manufactures) cannot be linked to performance information for particular establishments or firms. Yet region-specific industrial structure may be a crucial determinant of firm performance and thus regional economic fortunes as well (Chinitz 1961; Christopherson and Clark 2007). This paper examines how industrial concentration and agglomeration economies impact plant performance, focusing on the influence of establishment size in mediating these effects. The Longitudinal Research Database of the U.S. Census Bureau is accessed to construct production functions for three manufacturing industries nationwide. These production functions, specified at the establishment level, incorporate characteristics of establishments, industries, and regions, including spatially-differentiated measures of agglomeration economies. Establishment size is evaluated both as an absolute metric and relative to other regional industry plants, as theory suggests that absolute size may be most pertinent to agglomeration benefits but relative size more relevant to industrial structure (Caves and Barton 1990; Bothner 2005).

The Spatial Extent of Agglomeration Economies: Evidence from Three U.S. Manufacturing Industries,,"The spatial extent of localized agglomeration economies constitutes one of the central current questions in regional science. It is crucial for understanding firm location decisions and for assessing the influence of proximity in shaping spatial patterns of economic activity, yet clear-cut answers are difficult to come by. Theoretical work often fails to define or specify the spatial dimension of agglomeration phenomena. Existing empirical evidence is far from consistent. Most sources of data on economic performance do not supply micro-level information containing usable geographic locations. This paper provides evidence of the distances across which distinct sources of agglomeration economies generate benefits for plants belonging to three manufacturing industries in the United States. Confidential data from the Longitudinal Research Database of the United States Census Bureau are used to estimate cross-sectional production function systems at the establishment level for three contrasting industries in three different years. Along with relevant establishment, industry, and regional characteristics, the production functions include variables that indicate the local availability of potential labor and supply pools and knowledge spillovers. Information on individual plant locations at the county scale permits spatial differentiation of the agglomeration variables within geographic regions. Multiple distance decay profiles are investigated in order to explore how modifying the operationalization of proximity affects indicated patterns of agglomeration externalities and interfirm interactions. The results imply that industry characteristics are at least as important as the type of externality mechanism in determining the spatial pattern of agglomeration benefits. The research methods borrow from earlier work by the author that examines the relationships between regional industrial structure and manufacturing production.",2012,2012-01-01,1,{'Joshua Drucker'},,Regional Economics and Spatial Analysis; Regional Economic and Spatial Analysis; Spatial and Panel Data Analysis,RePEc: Research Papers in Economics,preprint,Joshua M Drucker,https://openalex.org/A5011423120,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue; Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Triangle

Contrary to the effects of tax cuts, we find no effects of tax increases on income inequality at the state level.

"The Increasing Effect of Neighborhood Racial Composition on Housing Values, 1980–2015",https://doi.org/10.1093/socpro/spaa033,"Abstract Beginning in the 1930s, neighborhood racial composition was an explicit determining factor in the evaluation of U.S. home values. This deliberate practice was outlawed in the 1960s and 1970s, but the correlation between neighborhood racial composition and home values persists. Using Census Bureau data from 1980 to 2015, the present study investigates the changing relationship between neighborhood racial composition and home appraisals, as well as the mechanisms that drive it. Contrary to what is often presumed, neighborhood racial composition was a stronger determinant of appraised values in 2015 than it was in 1980. Results suggest this is primarily due to contemporary appraising practices. Specifically, the use of the sales comparison approach has allowed historical racialized appraisals to influence contemporary values and appraisers’ racialized assumptions about neighborhoods to drive appraisal methods. These findings provide strong evidence that persistent racial inequality is driven in part by perpetual devaluing of communities of color and they suggest further regulation is required to foster equity.",2020,2020-06-12,114,"{'Junia Howell', 'Elizabeth Korver‐Glenn'}",University of Pittsburgh,"Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Housing Market and Economics",Social Problems,article,Junia Howell,https://openalex.org/A5002223560,Commercial CoreLogic Multiple Listing Services (MLS); Census Bureau; Rental Housing Finance Survey,Census Bureau,Penn State

Salient Features of Vietnamese and Filipina Brides of American Citizens: Findings Based on the Micro Data of Recent American Community Surveys,https://doi.org/10.6191/jps.2012.1,"This paper studies the educational, employment, and income status of Vietnamese and Filipina brides of American citizens, based on the merged micro data of the 2005, 2006, and 2007 American Community Surveys.

This difference, together with the fact that the former tended to be much weaker in English language ability than the latter, contributed to (1) the finding that the Vietnamese brides had a lower employment rate than did the Filipina brides, and (2) the finding that the economic niche of the employed Vietnamese brides (in the salon sector) tended to yield substantially lower wages than did the economic niche of the employed Filipina brides (in the medical service sector). Since better-educated brides had a better chance to get married to better-educated husbands, we naturally found that the husbands of the Vietnamese brides tended to be less educated than the husbands of the Filipina brides. However, the gap in educational attainment between the two groups of husbands was substantially smaller than the corresponding gap between the two groups of the brides. Underlying this gender difference was the fact that in addition to educational status, beauty and pleasant personality were also important criteria for selecting wives, and the possibility that beauty and pleasant personality were not positively correlated with educational status. With respect to household income, the gap between the two groups of brides was not large, partly because of the strong tendency of the Vietnamese brides toward hypergamy. A nice finding was that both Filipina and Vietnamese wives of American citizens were at rather low risk of being in poverty. The rather negative images of foreign brides in higher-income Asian countries conveyed by many ethnographic studies have been countered by our more sanguine finding about the Vietnamese and Filipina brides in the United States. With respect to the idea that women in lower-income countries tend to accept hypogamy at the personal level in order to achieve hypergamy at the societal level, it was moderately supported by the Filipina cases but largely negated by the Vietnamese cases.",2012,2012-06-01,4,"{'Kao‐Lee Liaw', 'Ting Huang'}",McMaster University; McMaster University,"Migration and Labor Dynamics; Gender, Labor, and Family Dynamics; Intergenerational Family Dynamics and Caregiving",,article,Kao-lee Liaw,https://openalex.org/A5045545868,American Community Survey; FSRDC; Michigan RDC; Decennial Census; Census Bureau,American Community Survey,Michigan
"Characteristics of Japan-born Japanese in the United States: Students, Non-students, and Recent Brides of Non-Japan-born American Citizens",https://doi.org/10.4200/jjhg.63.6_483,"Our primary goal in writing this paper is to demonstrate the usefulness of micro data for research in social science so that a strong movement can emerge in Japan to persuade governmental and other agencies to make representative micro data sets widely available to researchers. Based on the merged micro data of the 2005, 2006, and 2007 American Community Surveys, we have found several features of the Japan-born Japanese residents in the United States that can be interpreted as reflections of the strong influences of the male breadwinner model and the Japanese-style employment system on the Japanese in Japan. These features include (1) the high proportion of post-secondary students being undergraduate rather than graduate students, (2) strong female-domination in the sex-compositions of both students and non-students, and (3) among non-students, very large gender gaps in educational attainment, employment rate, and wage level. For the subpopulation of the Japan-born Japanese brides of non-Japan-born American citizens, these influences were also reflected in their strong tendency to be in hypergamy and their relatively low employment rate. Reflecting the history of interactions between Japan and the United States, the Japan-born Japanese residents in the United States are found to show disproportionately heavy concentrations in the states of California and Hawaii and especially in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.",2011,2011-01-01,3,"{'Yoshitaka Ishikawa', 'Kao‐Lee Liaw'}",McMaster University; Kyoto University,"Migration and Labor Dynamics; Migration, Ethnicity, and Economy; Diaspora, migration, transnational identity",Japanese Journal of Human Geography,article,Kao-lee Liaw,https://openalex.org/A5045545868,American Community Survey; FSRDC; Michigan RDC; Decennial Census; Census Bureau,American Community Survey,Michigan
Understanding the Japanese-born Residents in the United States from the Determinants of their Wage Pattern: An Analysis Based on the Micro Data of the American Community Survey,https://doi.org/10.4200/jjhg.67.1_41,"By applying a nonlinear regression analysis to the micro data of the 2005-2007 American Community Surveys, this study focuses mainly on the dependence of the wages of male and female Japanese-born residents in the United States on (1) current age, (2) educational attainment, (3) the length of stay in the host country, and (4) the age at entry. To achieve better insights, the Japan-born residents are compared with their counterparts born in India, the Philippines, and Germany. Our main finding is that the wage pattern of Japanese-born males is radically different from those of their Indian-born and Philippine-born counterparts: (1) their wage level rises sharply as their current age increases from 25-29 to 45-49, (2) the wage premium of achieving a post-graduate degree over bachelor’s degree is very small and statistically insignificant, (3) the wage level of recent arrivals is substantially higher than that of earlier arrivals, and (4) those who arrived at relatively older ages earn substantially higher wages. In addition to the fact that many of these Japanese-born males were dispatched from Japan by Japanese corporations, this paradoxical finding suggests that their wage pattern is influenced substantially by Japan’s social norms and employment practices. Being relegated to secondary economic roles or excluded from the Japanese employment system, Japanese-born females have diverse psychological and socioeconomic reasons for migrating to the United States and are found to have a wage pattern that deviates less from those of their counterparts born in India and the Philippines. Although the wage pattern of German-born males also deviates to some extent from those of their Indian-born and Philippine-born counterparts, they differ markedly from Japanese-born males in having a very large wage premium for having completed postgraduate education.",2015,2015-01-01,0,"{'Kao‐Lee Liaw', 'Kazumasa Hanaoka'}",Tohoku University; McMaster University,"Migration, Ethnicity, and Economy; Migration and Labor Dynamics; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies",Japanese Journal of Human Geography,article,Kao-lee Liaw,https://openalex.org/A5045545868,American Community Survey; FSRDC; Michigan RDC; Decennial Census; Census Bureau,American Community Survey,Michigan
Uneven performance of Taiwan-born wage earners in the American and Canadian job market: Important roles of educational attainment and entry age,,"For the Taiwan-born male and female wage earners in America and Canada, this paper attempts to find their wage gaps between the two host countries and to explain the wage gaps by three factors (educational attainment, the age at entering the host country, and the recency of the entry) in the context of current age. We apply an exponential regression model to the micro data of the 20052007 American Community Survey and the 2006 Canadian census. Predicted overall wage gaps are separated into two components: structural and compositional. Our main findings are as follows. The inferiority in mean wage of the Taiwan-born in Canada relative to the Taiwan-born in America is extremely large (by 50% for males and 55% for females). Educational attainment and entry age, but not entry period, are found to be very important in accounting for these wage gaps. From the perspectives of both educational attainment and entry age, the Taiwan-born have not only a lower wage structure but also a less favorable composition in Canada than in America. Our main findings support the ideas that potential immigrants tend to rank America higher than Canada, and that the severe competition for limited number of immigrant visas results in a sorting process that yields a higher probability of entering America for those of higher quality. They also reflect the fact that a high proportion of the Taiwan-born in Canada escaped from Taiwan in the1990s in response to the confrontational relation between Taiwanese and Chinese governments and to the military threat of China.",2015,2015-01-01,0,"{'Chien-chia Liu', 'Kao‐Lee Liaw', 'Ji-Ping Lin'}",McMaster University,"Migration and Labor Dynamics; Migration, Ethnicity, and Economy; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies",,article,Kao-lee Liaw,https://openalex.org/A5045545868,American Community Survey; FSRDC; Michigan RDC; Decennial Census; Census Bureau,American Community Survey,Michigan
"Competition, Firm Innovation, and Growth under Imperfect Technology Spillovers",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3850146,"This paper studies the effect of competition on firm innovation by developing a discrete-time endogenous growth model where multi-product firms do two types of innovation subject to friction in technology spillovers. Firms improve their existing products through internal innovation while entering others' product markets through external innovation. We introduce novel friction termed imperfect technology spillovers, which refers to friction in learning others' technology in the process of external innovation. In contrast to existing models, this friction allows incumbent firms to defend themselves from competitors by building technological barriers through internal innovation. Using firm-level data from the U.S. Census Bureau integrated with firm-level patent data, we find regression results consistent with the model predictions. Our counterfactual analysis shows that rising competition leads incumbent firms to undertake (i) more (less) internal innovation for the products they have a (no) technological advantage in, and (ii) less external innovation. This compositional change in firm innovation affects overall innovation in the aggregate economy in different directions depending on the costs of external innovation. Specifically, the shift in innovation composition in response to rising competition decreases overall innovation in the U.S. while increasing that in an economy with high external innovation costs. These findings highlight that the change in innovation composition resulting from firms' strategic choices is an important margin to understand the heterogeneous effect of increasing competition on overall innovation across different countries.",2021,2021-01-01,0,"{'Karam Jo', 'Seula Kim'}","Korea Development Institute; University of Maryland, College Park","Economic Growth and Productivity; Firm Innovation and Growth; Energy, Environment, Economic Growth",SSRN Electronic Journal,article,Karam Jo,https://openalex.org/A5034676200,Annual Business Survey; Baruch RDC; Service Annual Survey; Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Baruch
How Does Venture Capital Financing Improve Efficiency in Private Firms? A Look Beneath the Surface,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1025322,"We use the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) of the U.S. Census Bureau, which covers the entire universe of private and public U.S. manufacturing firms, to study several related questions regarding the efficiency gains generated by venture capital (VC) investment in private firms. First, do VCs indeed improve the efficiency (total factor productivity, TFP) of private firms, and if so, are certain kinds of VCs (high reputation vs. low reputation) better at generating such efficiency gains than others? Second, do VCs invest in more efficient firms to begin with (screening), or do they improve efficiency after investment (monitoring)? Third, do efficiency improvements due to VC backing arise from increases in sales or reductions in costs? Fourth, does VC backing and the associated efficiency gains affect the probability of a successful exit (IPO or acquisition)? Our analysis shows that the overall efficiency of VC-backed firms is higher than that of non-VC-backed firms at every point in time. This efficiency advantage of VC-backed firms arises from both screening and monitoring: the efficiency of VC-backed firms prior to receiving financing is higher than that of non-VC-backed firms, and further, the growth in efficiency subsequent to VC financing is greater for such firms. The above increases in efficiency of VC-backed firms are spread over the first two rounds of VC financing after which the TFP of such firms remains constant until exit. Additionally, we show that while the TFP of firms prior to receiving financing is lower for high-reputation VC-backed firms, the increase in TFP subsequent to financing is significantly greater for these firms, consistent with high-reputation VCs having greater monitoring ability. We disentangle the screening and monitoring effects of VC backing using three different methodologies: switching regression with endogenous switching, regression discontinuity analysis, and propensity score matching. We show that while overall efficiency gains generated by VC backing arise primarily from improvements in sales, the efficiency gains of high-reputation VC-backed firms arise also from lower increases in production costs.

The Effects of Corporate Spin-offs on Productivity,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.682505,"Using a unique sample of plant level data from the Longitudinal Research Database of the U.S. Census Bureau, which enables us to correctly identify the parent and spun-off entities prior to spin-offs, we establish that efficiency improves following spin-offs. A spin-off refers to the separation of the management of some assets of a firm into a separate entity (which we term as the spun-off entity or subsidiary). Using treatment effect estimators and propensity score matching in our analysis, we identify, how (the precise channel and mechanism), where (parent or subsidiary), and when (the dynamic pattern) efficiency improvements arise following spin-offs. We show that spin-offs increase total factor productivity (TFP) and that such productivity improvements are long-lived. This post spin-off productivity improvement can be attributed to cost savings but not to higher sales and arise primarily in plants remaining with the parent. However, contrary to speculation in the previous literature, we show that plants that are spun-off do not underperform parent plants prior to the spin-off. We identify acquisitions following spin-offs and find that while productivity improvements occur immediately after the spin-off in the non-acquired plants, in the acquired plants they start only after being taken over by another firm. Finally, we show that unrelated spun-off entities show greater improvements in productivity compared to related spun-off entities.",2009,2009-01-01,2,"{'Thomas J.

The Contextual Influences of Police and Social Service Providers on Formal Help-Seeking After Incidents of Intimate Partner Violence,https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260520915551,"Police notification and social service acquisition are two forms of formal help-seeking linked to improved outcomes among survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV), including better socio-emotional health, improved physical health, and, importantly, increased safety. The majority of research devoted to the study of formal help-seeking among survivors of IPV focuses on incident- and individual-level factors and their relationship with formal resource utilization. Much less is known about community-level factors. Using a nationally representative sample of incidents of IPV from the National Crime Victimization Survey (2006–2016), this work explores how law enforcement and social service resources in a community are related to police notification and survivor acquisition of a victim service after an incident of IPV, net of incident- and individual-level factors. Logistic regression models indicate that the number of law enforcement personnel per 1,000 residents in a county is positively associated with police notification after an incident of IPV, and it exerts an indirect effect on survivor service acquisition through police notification. Additional analyses reveal that the race/ethnicity of the survivor of IPV is a key demographic in the explanation of this relationship, as incidents of IPV involving White and Hispanic survivors of IPV are more likely to come to the attention of police as the number of law enforcement personnel increases. The reverse is true for incidents involving Black survivors of IPV. No differences across survivor sex emerged. Potential reasons to account for varying effects across race/ethnicity are discussed as well as the importance of additional funding for police and social service agencies to serve survivors of IPV and meet the dual goals of offender accountability and survivor safety and well-being.",2020,2020-05-18,10,"{'Katherine Calle Willyard', 'Megan Bears Augustyn'}",The University of Texas at San Antonio; Texas A&M University,Intimate Partner and Family Violence; Crime Patterns and Interventions; Sexual Assault and Victimization Studies,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,article,Katherine Calle Willyard,https://openalex.org/A5040647112,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing; National Crime Victimization Survey; Texas RDC; Decennial Census,National Crime Victimization Survey,Texas

Differential Recovery Migration across the Rural–Urban Gradient: Minimal and Short‐Term Population Gains for Rural Disaster‐Affected Gulf Coast Counties,https://doi.org/10.1111/ruso.12305,"Abstract Places affected or threatened by extreme environmental disturbances confront a number of significant issues, including whether their populations will stay the same or change through migration. Research on Hurricanes Katrina and Rita shows some displaced residents returned to their disaster‐affected communities once the built environment was restored, new migrants settled in affected places as part of the rebuilding effort, and the regional migration system grew more urbanized and spatially concentrated during post‐disaster years. Research also shows that not all disaster‐affected places recovered their populations. Our study examines whether differential recovery is systematically patterned along the rural–urban gradient. Using U.S. Census Bureau estimates and IRS county‐to‐county migration data, we investigate whether the 2005 hurricane season differentially exacerbated or altered previous migration trends across a rural–urban gradient that incorporates proximity to metropolitan areas and disaster‐related housing loss. We find a rural–urban differential in Gulf Coast recovery migration: The disaster boosted migration among non‐metropolitan counties, yet these increases were smaller and short‐lived compared to the patterns found for metropolitan counties, most especially high loss metropolitan counties. Our findings encourage theories of environmental migration to incorporate spatial differentiation and scenarios of environmental changes to account for differential impacts on settlement patterns across the rural–urban continuum.",2019,2019-10-13,16,"{'Rachel A.

U.S. Decennial Census Digitization and Linkage Project,https://doi.org/10.23889/ijpds.v4i3.1310,"The U.S. Census Bureau maintains a large longitudinal research infrastructure that currently includes linked data from the 1940 census, the 2000-2010 censuses, major national surveys going back to 1973, and administrative records dating back to the 1990s. These restricted data are accessible to researchers around the U.S. via the Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (FSRDC) network. The major shortcoming of this infrastructure is that it lacks linkable files from the decennial censuses of 1950 through 1990. Full-count microdata from these censuses are available for research, but datasets from these years do not include respondent names and therefore have not been linked over time. Respondent names for these censuses are available only via the original census returns, which are stored on 258,000 reels of microfilm.&#x0D; The Decennial Census Digitization and Linkage project (DCDL) is an initiative to recover names from the 1960-1990 censuses and to produce linked restricted microdata files for research use. We describe the results of a pilot project we completed on the 1990 census. For that pilot, we created digital images from census microfilm, hand-keyed ""truth data"" from those images, supported two teams' attempts to conduct Handwriting Recognition on the images, appended recovered names to already-existing microdata files, and linked the new 1990 census microdata records to previous and subsequent censuses. We describe our processes, the accuracy of the Handwriting Recognition, and the accuracy of the record linkage with the recovered names. We conclude by providing an update on the recently-initiated project to carry out these processes on a production scale for the 1960 through 1990 censuses.&#x0D; When combined with existing linkages between the censuses of 1940, 2000, 2010, the soon-to-be public 1950 census, and the future 2020 census, DCDL will provide the final component in a massive longitudinal data infrastructure that covers most of the U.S. population since 1940.

The Missing Link: Data Capture Technology and the Making of a Longitudinal U.S. Census Infrastructure,https://doi.org/10.1109/mahc.2022.3195001,"Social scientists’ use of linked decennial census data has grown extensively over the past two decades.

The 2000 and 2010 decennial data have been linked to one another and back to the 1940 Census. For the censuses in between these years—from 1950 to 1990—no linked data are available yet. This paper focuses on the technological advances in data capture that have enabled this centuries-long longitudinal data infrastructure to flourish while still leaving a sizeable “missing link” from 1950 to 1990.

Reconciling Parent-Child Relationships across US Administrative Datasets,https://doi.org/10.23889/ijpds.v3i4.864,"IntroductionPopulation data capture children, parents, relatives, and others moving in and out of households. The U.S. has seen falling marriage rates, and increases in multigenerational households and complex families, young children living with grandparents, and adult children living with parents. Robust parent-child linkages are critical to understand these demographic shifts.&#x0D; Objectives and ApproachWe construct and validate parent-child linkages over a century to observe how U.S. households are changing over time. The three largest person-based datafiles in the U.S. are the decennial censuses, the Social Security Administration transaction file, and individual tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service. These sources operationalize relationships differently, capture data at various frequencies, and gather the data for unique purposes. We use probabilistic matching to observe and reconcile parent-child relationships across these sources. The data include a variety of personal identifiers including name, date of birth, parents’ names, address, and place of birth that support matching and validation.&#x0D; ResultsWe find that understanding the content, consistency, and coverage of the files before matching is critical for high quality linkages. The representativeness of the parent-child relationship file improves over time, with the weakest coverage for the Greatest Generation and the strongest coverage for Millennials. Coverage varies by source: tax data underrepresent non-white children and have duplicate records for SSNs, while names and dates of birth are missing from Census data. Multiple match rates differ among demographic groups and over time. In the matching process, the blocking variables rely on common variables across the population datasets. Our approach provides robust entity resolution for women, despite married-maiden name changes. We describe challenges due to data problems in old census records and validation changes in social security data.&#x0D; Conclusion/ImplicationsWe conduct a successful reconciliation of parent-child relationships in U.S. population level files. The project supports operational and research uses, such as the 2020 Census. We will extend this work using graph matching and will expand the method to validate other relationship links including spouses and siblings.",2018,2018-09-05,1,"{'Amy O’Hara', 'Trent Alexander', 'Carla Medalia', 'Katie R.

U.S. Fertility in Life Course Context: A Research Note on Using Census-Held Linked Administrative Records for Geographic and Sociodemographic Subgroup Estimation,https://doi.org/10.1215/00703370-11234861,"Abstract Fertility is a life course process that is strongly shaped by geographic and sociodemographic subgroup contexts. In the United States, scholars face a choice: they can situate fertility in a life course perspective using panel data, which is typically representative only at the national level; or they can attend to subnational contexts using rate schedules, which do not include information on life course statuses. The method and data source we introduce here, Census-Held Linked Administrative Records for Fertility Estimation (CLAR-FE), permits both. It derives fertility histories and rate schedules from U.S. Census Bureau–held data for the nation and by state, racial and ethnic subgroups, and the important life course status of parity. We generate three types of rates for 2000–2020 at the national and state levels by race and ethnicity: age-specific rates and both unconditional and conditional parity- and age-specific rates. Where possible, we compare these rates with those produced by the National Center for Health Statistics. Our new rate schedules illuminate state and racial and ethnic differences in transitions to parenthood, providing evidence of the important subgroup heterogeneity that characterizes the United States. CLAR-FE covers nearly the entire U.S. population and is available to researchers on approved projects through the Census Bureau's Federal Statistical Research Data Centers.",2024,2024-03-20,0,"{'Katie R.

Reconciling Parent-Child Relationships across US Administrative Datasets,https://doi.org/10.23889/ijpds.v3i4.864,"IntroductionPopulation data capture children, parents, relatives, and others moving in and out of households. The U.S. has seen falling marriage rates, and increases in multigenerational households and complex families, young children living with grandparents, and adult children living with parents. Robust parent-child linkages are critical to understand these demographic shifts.&#x0D; Objectives and ApproachWe construct and validate parent-child linkages over a century to observe how U.S. households are changing over time. The three largest person-based datafiles in the U.S. are the decennial censuses, the Social Security Administration transaction file, and individual tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service. These sources operationalize relationships differently, capture data at various frequencies, and gather the data for unique purposes. We use probabilistic matching to observe and reconcile parent-child relationships across these sources. The data include a variety of personal identifiers including name, date of birth, parents’ names, address, and place of birth that support matching and validation.&#x0D; ResultsWe find that understanding the content, consistency, and coverage of the files before matching is critical for high quality linkages. The representativeness of the parent-child relationship file improves over time, with the weakest coverage for the Greatest Generation and the strongest coverage for Millennials. Coverage varies by source: tax data underrepresent non-white children and have duplicate records for SSNs, while names and dates of birth are missing from Census data. Multiple match rates differ among demographic groups and over time. In the matching process, the blocking variables rely on common variables across the population datasets. Our approach provides robust entity resolution for women, despite married-maiden name changes. We describe challenges due to data problems in old census records and validation changes in social security data.&#x0D; Conclusion/ImplicationsWe conduct a successful reconciliation of parent-child relationships in U.S. population level files. The project supports operational and research uses, such as the 2020 Census. We will extend this work using graph matching and will expand the method to validate other relationship links including spouses and siblings.",2018,2018-09-05,1,"{'Amy O’Hara', 'Trent Alexander', 'Carla Medalia', 'Katie R.

U.S. Decennial Census Digitization and Linkage Project,https://doi.org/10.23889/ijpds.v4i3.1310,"The U.S. Census Bureau maintains a large longitudinal research infrastructure that currently includes linked data from the 1940 census, the 2000-2010 censuses, major national surveys going back to 1973, and administrative records dating back to the 1990s. These restricted data are accessible to researchers around the U.S. via the Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (FSRDC) network. The major shortcoming of this infrastructure is that it lacks linkable files from the decennial censuses of 1950 through 1990. Full-count microdata from these censuses are available for research, but datasets from these years do not include respondent names and therefore have not been linked over time. Respondent names for these censuses are available only via the original census returns, which are stored on 258,000 reels of microfilm.&#x0D; The Decennial Census Digitization and Linkage project (DCDL) is an initiative to recover names from the 1960-1990 censuses and to produce linked restricted microdata files for research use. We describe the results of a pilot project we completed on the 1990 census. For that pilot, we created digital images from census microfilm, hand-keyed ""truth data"" from those images, supported two teams' attempts to conduct Handwriting Recognition on the images, appended recovered names to already-existing microdata files, and linked the new 1990 census microdata records to previous and subsequent censuses. We describe our processes, the accuracy of the Handwriting Recognition, and the accuracy of the record linkage with the recovered names. We conclude by providing an update on the recently-initiated project to carry out these processes on a production scale for the 1960 through 1990 censuses.&#x0D; When combined with existing linkages between the censuses of 1940, 2000, 2010, the soon-to-be public 1950 census, and the future 2020 census, DCDL will provide the final component in a massive longitudinal data infrastructure that covers most of the U.S. population since 1940. As a multi-purpose statistical tool, the DCDL will further the U.S. Census Bureau's mission to provide high quality data on the U.S. population and support cutting-edge research in the FSRDC network.

U.S. Fertility in Life Course Context: A Research Note on Using Census-Held Linked Administrative Records for Geographic and Sociodemographic Subgroup Estimation,https://doi.org/10.1215/00703370-11234861,"Abstract Fertility is a life course process that is strongly shaped by geographic and sociodemographic subgroup contexts. In the United States, scholars face a choice: they can situate fertility in a life course perspective using panel data, which is typically representative only at the national level; or they can attend to subnational contexts using rate schedules, which do not include information on life course statuses. The method and data source we introduce here, Census-Held Linked Administrative Records for Fertility Estimation (CLAR-FE), permits both. It derives fertility histories and rate schedules from U.S. Census Bureau–held data for the nation and by state, racial and ethnic subgroups, and the important life course status of parity. We generate three types of rates for 2000–2020 at the national and state levels by race and ethnicity: age-specific rates and both unconditional and conditional parity- and age-specific rates. Where possible, we compare these rates with those produced by the National Center for Health Statistics. Our new rate schedules illuminate state and racial and ethnic differences in transitions to parenthood, providing evidence of the important subgroup heterogeneity that characterizes the United States. CLAR-FE covers nearly the entire U.S. population and is available to researchers on approved projects through the Census Bureau's Federal Statistical Research Data Centers.",2024,2024-03-20,0,"{'Katie R.

Homeowner Investments: Are They Shaped by Perceptions of Neighborhood Risk?,,"This paper explores how perceptions of neighborhood quality and risk shape the investment decisions of homeowners. Using the confidential, geo-coded version of the American Housing Survey, this paper links household perceptions of neighborhood quality to actual measures of neighborhood quality and estimates how these factors influence a households decision to invest in their home. This paper will be the first to include measures of neighborhood level house price appreciation, crime rates, school quality and racial composition in modeling the investment decision of a homeowner. Based on estimates from the 2003 AHS, American households spent approximately $250 billion dollars on home improvements over the course of two years, (Leventis, 2007) compared to $5.6 billion annual investment from CDBG and HOME. This large contribution from homeowners means that the future condition of our housing stock rests on the decisions made by owner-occupiers. Indirectly the future of Americas neighborhoods is also dependent on upkeep by homeowners. When a household decides whether or not to invest in improving their home, they must predict how much of their costs they will be able to recover when they sell their unit. Increased perceptions of neighborhood risk could discourage home improvement if a household believes they will not be able to recoup their financial investment when they sell the house. The household must also predict how much consumption value they will gain from the investment, which will depend on their expected length of stay. Perceptions of neighborhood risk could decrease the likelihood a household will stay in their unit, leading to lower consumption benefits from a renovation. Galster (1987) finds that households which are one unit more pessimistic on a neighborhood expectations scale are expected to spend $542 less annually on upkeep than those who are one unit less pessimistic. This represents 75% of the annual expenditure made on improvements by the average household in 1987. In this paper, I estimate the maintenance decision as a reaction function to the level of neighborhood quality and risk, the householders socioeconomic characteristics, the dwelling unit value, and the socioeconomic characteristics of the households neighbors. First I estimate which factors influence the probability a household will invest in their home, and then I look at the factors associated with the dollar value of the investment. This paper will provide a rich understanding of how perceptions of neighborhood quality and risk factor into a homeowners decision to invest in their property.",2010,2010-11-29,0,{'Keren Mertens Horn'},University of Massachusetts Boston,"Housing Market and Economics; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Financial Literacy, Pension, Retirement Analysis",SSRN Electronic Journal,article,Keren M Horn,https://openalex.org/A5050732266,Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey; American Community Survey; American Housing Survey,American Housing Survey,Baruch
Pathways to Integration: Examining Changes in the Prevalence of Racially Integrated Neighborhoods,,"Few researchers have studied integrated neighborhoods, yet these neighborhoods offer an important window into broader patterns of segregation. We explore changes in racial integration in recent decades using decennial census tract data from 1990, 2000, and 2010. We begin by examining changes in the prevalence of racially integrated neighborhoods and find significant growth in the presence of integrated neighborhoods during this time period, with the share of metropolitan neighborhoods that are integrated increasing from just under 20 percent to just over 30 percent. We then shed light on the pathways through which these changes have occurred. We find both a small increase in the number of neighborhoods becoming integrated for the first time during this period and a more sizable increase in the share of integrated neighborhoods that remained integrated. Finally, we offer insights about which neighborhoods become integrated in the first place and which remain stably integrated over time.",2012,2012-09-01,52,"{'Keren Mertens Horn', 'Ingrid Gould Ellen'}",,"Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; School Choice and Performance; Homelessness and Social Issues",Cityscape,article,Keren M Horn,https://openalex.org/A5050732266,Decennial Census; Baruch RDC; Census of Manufactures; Integrated Longitudinal Business Database,Decennial Census,Baruch
Measuring the Flow-Down of Injury Risks Along the Subcontracting Chain in the U.S. Construction Industry,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4844585,"Construction workers experience high rates of injury relative to other occupations. Previous research based on case/interview studies at the level of a craft or establishment and the statistical analysis of injuries across regions finds that subcontracting raises injury rates. This study is the first to combine establishment-level information from the Census Bureau's Economic Census of Construction Industries with data on workplace injuries from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses. With these data, we assess how a contractor's position on the subcontracting chain and other establishment characteristics are associated with the number and likelihood of injuries on the job. Findings indicate that as work flows down subcontracting chains, that work is associated with higher rates of injury. Up-chain contractors can choose what scope of work they will keep on a project and what they will offload.

Measuring the Flow-Down of Injury Risks Along the Subcontracting Chain in the U.S. Construction Industry,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4844585,"Construction workers experience high rates of injury relative to other occupations. Previous research based on case/interview studies at the level of a craft or establishment and the statistical analysis of injuries across regions finds that subcontracting raises injury rates. This study is the first to combine establishment-level information from the Census Bureau's Economic Census of Construction Industries with data on workplace injuries from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses. With these data, we assess how a contractor's position on the subcontracting chain and other establishment characteristics are associated with the number and likelihood of injuries on the job. Findings indicate that as work flows down subcontracting chains, that work is associated with higher rates of injury. Up-chain contractors can choose what scope of work they will keep on a project and what they will offload.

The trade-offs of teamwork among STEM doctoral graduates.,https://doi.org/10.1037/amp0000288,"Teamwork has increasingly become prevalent in professional fields such as academic science, perhaps partly because research shows that teams tend to produce superior work. Although research on teamwork has typically focused on its impact on work products, we complement that work by examining the degree to which teamwork influences salary, hours worked, and overall job satisfaction. Drawing on microdata collected through the National Science Foundation's Survey of Doctorate Recipients as well as the Survey of Earned Doctorates, we find that doctoral degree holders in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields tend to earn substantially higher salaries and work more hours when they engage in teamwork. We also find no comparable difference in overall job satisfaction as a function of whether individuals work within teams. Additionally, we find evidence that age interacts significantly with teamwork, whereby older teamworkers tend to earn relatively more when participating in teams without appearing to work more hours; and we show that employment sector is important, whereby teamwork is relevant for salaries and hours worked in education and industry but not in government. Although our study is based on market outcomes and behavioral measures, our findings provide grounds for future research that examines the psychological mechanisms that are relevant to understanding why people join teams as well as the psychological consequences that people encounter through teamwork. More generally, this study provides a model for considering individual-level antecedents and outcomes associated with teamwork when degrees of discretion exist with respect to teaming.

Accounting for Demographic and Salary Changes among Business School Faculty,https://doi.org/10.5465/ambpp.2020.21357abstract,"This article examines patterns of change among Business and non-Business PhD cohorts in the United States as well as comparisons across Business subfields. By drawing upon responses to the Survey of Earned Doctorates, we track changes in the backgrounds of doctoral graduates and find a trend over the past 20 years towards more gender, ethnic, and citizenship diversity. We also find that PhD cohorts in Business opt for Industry employment at approximately the same rate as non-Business PhD cohorts while very few pursue “postdoc” employment. We show substantial differences whereby Business salaries tend to be diverging towards nearly twice the income paid to non-Business doctoral graduates and – among the Business subfields – we find a wide range with Accounting earning the highest wages and Human Resources being paid the lowest. Our findings suggest that Business School faculty are not paid relatively high wages due to private-sector competition as is conventionally assumed; instead, it seems plausible that the salary differential exists partly to compensate for the typically higher wages earned by the non-PhD graduates that business schools train. Alternate explanations include the possibility that there current Business School faculty salaries are the unsustainable result of runaway competition among schools. Greater awareness and exploration of the types of patterns that we report offers important baselines for (prospective) PhD students and their advisors.

Labor Market Effects of the Affordable Care Act: Evidence from a Tax Notch,,"States that declined to raise their Medicaid income eligibility cutoffs to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) created a coverage gap'' between their existing, often much lower Medicaid eligibility cutoffs and the FPL, the lowest level of income at which the ACA provides refundable, advanceable tax credits'' to subsidize the purchase of private insurance. Lacking access to any form of subsidized health insurance, residents of those states with income in that range face a strong incentive, in the form of a large, discrete increase in post-tax income (i.e. an upward notch) at the FPL, to increase their earnings and obtain the premium tax credit. We investigate the extent to which they respond to that incentive. Using the universe of tax returns, we document excess mass, or bunching, in the income distribution surrounding this notch. Consistent with Saez (2010), we find that bunching occurs only among filers with self-employment income. Specifically, filers without children and married filers with three or fewer children exhibit significant bunching. Analysis of tax data linked to labor supply measures from the American Community Survey, however, suggests that this bunching likely reflects a change in reported income rather than a change in true labor supply. We find no evidence that wage and salary workers adjust their labor supply in response to increased availability of directly purchased health insurance.",2017,2017-07-01,3,"{'Kevin Rinz', 'Kavan Kucko', 'Benjamin Solow'}",,"Healthcare Policy and Management; Gender, Labor, and Family Dynamics; Global Health Care Issues",RePEc: Research Papers in Economics,preprint,Kevin Rinz,https://openalex.org/A5035299112,LEHD Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) - 2014; Current Population Survey March Supplement; American Community Survey,American Community Survey,Philadelphia

Declines in Employer Sponsored Health Insurance Coverage: Differences by Firm Size,,"Even before the current recession, employer-sponsored health insurance rates declined dramatically, falling 6.2 percentage points between 2000 and 2006 for non-elderly Americans. This decline reversed a previous upward trend from 1997 to 2000. During the last documented period of decline, 1987 to 1996, Cooper and Schone (1997) analyzed household survey data and demonstrated that the fall in employer-sponsored coverage was due to a decline in take-up rates for offered coverage, not a decline in employer offer rates. There has been little research since then that tracks the components of the more recent period of decline in employment related coverage. In this paper, we use data from private sector employers in the 2000 and 2008 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component (MEPS-IC). Using this data allows us to examine changes in employee-level coverage rates in combination with detailed data on employee premium contributions and the wage and firm size distribution of employers. Our work will establish a baseline that will help evaluate changes resulting from the anticipated enactment of health care reform legislation in the near future. We decompose overall changes in employee coverage rates into the following components: changes in the percent of employees in establishments that offer health insurance (offer rates), eligibility rates, overall percent of employees eligible for health insurance that are enrolled in health insurance (enrollment or take-up rates) and enrollment rates for single and family coverage among those eligible for coverage. We investigate whether there are differences in trends in these components by the firm size and wage distribution of employers. We provide descriptive statistics for these components, providing additional detail for enrollment rates on the relationship between mean enrollment rates and employee premium contributions. We also use econometric decomposition techniques to investigate whether changes in the components of coverage rates are due to changes in the explanatory variables or changes in coefficients.Preliminary analyses indicate that the underlying components of the more recent decline differ from those in the earlier period, particularly for the smallest firms (with < 10 workers). In those firms, offer rates declined and take-up rates increased. For the largest employers (with 1,000 or more workers) offer rates remained steady. Since eligibility rates remained steady in the smallest firms, the decline in access to coverage may be due to fewer offers. Among all but the smallest employers, the explanations for the decline in coverage rates echoed those of the earlier time period - declining take-up rates were responsible for the decline in coverage. These changes may reflect the increases in the share of total premiums paid by employees over this period for employees in the largest firms and those with 25-99 employees. In contrast, the share of total premiums remained steady for employees in the smallest firms which may explain their more stable trends in take-up rates.

Disparities and change over time in distance women would need to travel to have an abortion in the USA: a spatial analysis,https://doi.org/10.1016/s2468-2667(17)30158-5,"BackgroundAbortion can help women to control their fertility and is an important component of health care for women. Although women in the USA who live further from an abortion clinic are less likely to obtain an abortion than women who live closer to an abortion clinic, no national study has examined inequality in access to abortion and whether inequality has increased as the number of abortion clinics has declined.MethodsFor this analysis, we obtained data on abortion clinics for 2000, 2011, and 2014 from the Guttmacher Institute's Abortion Provider Census. Block groups and the percentage of women aged 15–44 years by census tract were obtained from the US Census Bureau. Distance to the nearest clinic was calculated for the population-weighted centroid of every block group. We calculated the median distance to an abortion clinic for women in each county and the median and 80th percentile distances for each state by weighting block groups by the number of women of reproductive age (15–44 years).FindingsIn 2014, women in the USA would have had to travel a median distance of 10·79 miles (17·36 km) to reach the nearest abortion clinic, although 20% of women would have had to travel 42·54 miles (68·46 km) or more. We found substantially greater variation within than between states because, even in mostly rural states, women and clinics were concentrated in urban areas. We identified spatial disparities in abortion access, which were broadly unchanged, at least as far back as 2000.InterpretationWe showed substantial and persistent spatial disparities in access to abortion in the USA. These results contribute to an emerging literature documenting similar disparities in other high-income countries.FundingAn anonymous grant to the Guttmacher Institute.",2017,2017-10-05,122,"{'Rachel K.

Relative to male earnings inequality, the inequality of couples' earnings is both lower in levels and rises by a smaller amount. We also find that couples' earnings instability is lower in levels compared to male earnings instability and actually declines in the SIPP-SSA data. While wives' earnings played an important role in dampening the rise in inequality and year-to-year variation in resources at the family level, we find that marital sorting and coordination of labor supply decisions at the family level played a minor role. Comparing actual couples to randomly paired simulated couples, we find very similar trends in earnings inequality and instability.

Trends in Earnings Instability of Couples: How Important is Marital Sorting?,,"Using the matched March Current Population Surveys for 1968-2008 and 19782006 Social Security earnings data matched to several Survey of Income and Program Participation panels, this paper examines the evolution of variability in year-to-year changes in individual and couples’ earnings. We find couples’ earnings instability remained stable over time due to offsetting trends in men’s and women’s earnings instability. While men’s earnings instability increased, particularly during the 1970s, women’s earnings instability declined dramatically. We find some evidence that the correlation of spouses’ earnings changes became more positively related over time, but we generally find these correlations to be small. Comparing actual couples to simulated couples who are randomly matched, we find similar trends in earnings instability, suggesting that marital coordination of work and marital sorting are relatively unimportant for instability measures. 1 Disclaimer: Any opinions and conclusions expressed herein are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the U.S. Census Bureau.

The Impact of 2010 Decennial Census Hiring on the Unemployment Rate,,"The decennial census is the largest peacetime operation of the U.S. federal government. The Census Bureau hires hundreds of thousands of temporary workers to conduct the decennial census. The magnitude of this temporary workforce influences the national employment situation when enumeration efforts ramp up and when they recede. The impact of decennial census hiring on the headline number of payroll jobs added each month is well established, but previous work has not established how decennial census hiring affects the headline unemployment rate. We link the 2010 Decennial Applicant Personnel and Payroll System data to the 2010 American Community Survey to answer this question. We find that the large hiring surge in May 2010 came mostly from people already employed (40 percent) or from people who were unemployed (33 percent). We estimate that the workers hired for Census 2010 lowered the May 2010 unemployment rate by one-tenth of a percentage point relative to the counterfactual. This one-tenth of a percentage point is within the standard error for the official unemployment rate, and BLS press releases would denote a change in the unemployment rate of 0.1% or less as “unchanged.” We also estimate that relative to the counterfactual, the more gradual changes in decennial census employment influenced the unemployment rate by less than one-tenth of a percentage point in every other month during 2010.",2020,2020-01-01,0,"{'Mark A.

Selection and Specialization in the Evolution of Couples' Earnings,,"We examine changes across birth cohorts in marriage patterns and the earnings differentials associated with marriage using data from a series of Survey of Income and Program Participation panels linked to administrative data on earnings. We find that marriage has become increasingly positively selected on education and earnings potential. Among women, selection into marriage has reversed sign, with the most educated women switching from being the least likely to be married to being the most likely. While men with the highest earnings potential have always been more likely to be married, this relationship has become even more pronounced. Changing selection into marriage is entirely responsible for the observed decline in marriage penalty for women in the cross section. In fixed-effects regressions, the earnings penalty continues to exist even for the most recent cohorts, consistent with specialization after marriage. For men, we find that the marriage premium actually increases for more recent birth cohorts in fixed-effects regressions. Taken literally, this suggests that specialization has become more important. We plan to explore further the robustness of this result by allowing selection to affect not only the level but the growth rate of male earnings.

"The Shifting Destinations of Metropolitan Migrants in the U.S., 2005–2011",https://doi.org/10.1111/grow.12187,"Abstract Recent estimates that central cities are growing faster than their suburbs in the U.S. have captured the attention of both academics and the popular media. Many commentators have used these numbers to claim that internal migration trends in the U.S. have reached a turning point, in which migrants increasingly prefer urban residences to suburban locales. However, these assertions often rely on problematic definitions of city and suburb, and pay too little attention to demographic variations among migrants. This paper examines whether recent internal migrants in the U.S. are choosing closer‐in destinations, drawing from microdata samples from the American Community Survey since 2005. During this period, there is an overall trend of migrants to the largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. choosing to migrate closer to the metropolitan core. However, this trend varies significantly among major demographic groups; whereas younger, single, educated, and white‐collar migrants show evidence of a return to the core, migrants who are blue‐collar, less‐educated, older, and with families remain more suburban. In turn, this analysis suggests that overall trends of “back to the city” migration are producing considerable divergence in the metropolitan destinations of different demographic groups.",2017,2017-01-12,11,{'Kyle E.

Analyzing US Census Data,https://doi.org/10.1201/9780203711415,"Census data is widely used by practitioners to understand demographic change, allocate resources, address inequalities, and make sound business decisions. Until recently, projects using US Census data have required proficiency with multiple web interfaces and software platforms to prepare, map, and present data products. This book introduces readers to tools in the R programming language for accessing and analyzing Census data and shows how to carry out demographic analyses in a single computing environment. Chapters in this book cover the following key topics: • Rapidly acquiring data from the decennial US Census and American Community Survey using R, then analyzing these datasets using tidyverse tools; • Visualizing US Census data with a wide range of methods including charts in ggplot2 as well as both static and interactive maps; • Using R as a geographic information system (GIS) to manage, analyze, and model spatial demographic data from the US Census; • Working with and modeling individual-level microdata from the American Community Survey's PUMS datasets; • Applying these tools and workflows to the analysis of historical Census data, other US government datasets, and international Census data from countries like Canada, Brazil, Kenya, and Mexico.",2023,2023-01-10,5,{'Kyle E.

Skip-generational living is associated with high female incarceration rates. Conditional on demographic characteristics and these contextual factors, seniors in multigenerational living arrangements are less likely to be in poverty and those in skip-generational arrangements more likely.

The Impact of Expanding Public Health Insurance on Safety Net Program Participation: Evidence from the ACA Medicaid Expansion,,"The expansion of public insurance eligibility that occurred with the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansions may have spillover effects to other public assistance programs. We explore the impact of the ACA on two large safety net programs: the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). We use a county border-pair research design, examining county-level administrative measures of EITC and SNAP participation in contiguous county pairs that cross state lines where the county on one side of the border experienced the Medicaid expansion and the county on the other side did not. This approach allows us to focus narrowly on differences arising from the ACA Medicaid expansion choice, implicitly controlling for local economic trends that could affect safety net participation. Our results suggest that the Medicaid expansion increased participation in SNAP, and possibly in the EITC, in counties that expanded relative to nearby counties that did not expand.

Using establishment data from the US Census Bureau between 1997 and 2016, we find evidence of both monopoly and monopsony, where the former is rising over this period and the latter is stable.

Absentee Ownership and Rental Affordability: Evidence from Commuting Zones,https://doi.org/10.1080/07360932.2024.2444317,"In this paper, we examine the intersection of financialization, wealth inequality, and the housing market in the United States with an emphasis on the relationship between absentee ownership and declining rental affordability. At the same time as financialization has increasingly transformed the market for residential real estate into a vehicle for financial speculation, households at the bottom of the income distribution have been disproportionately affected by rising rents and declining housing affordability. Using data from the decennial Census and the American Community Survey from 1990 to 2020, we investigate the link between absentee ownership and rental affordability across US commuting zones. Panel fixed-effects estimates suggest a 10 percentage-point increase in absentee ownership results in a 6.7% increase in average rent, a 1.6 percentage-point increase in the ratio of median commuting zone rent to median commuting zone income, and an approximately 1.4 percentage-point increase in the share of households in a commuting zone that are rent burdened.

The Effects of Occupational Licensing: Evidence from Business‐Level Data,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjir.12434,"Abstract Occupational licensing currently affects more than 1,000 occupations in the United States. I use confidential US Census Bureau business micro‐data to shed light on the effect of occupational licensing in cosmetology on key market outcomes and study its effect on the providers of occupational training. Occupational licensing regulation does not seem to affect the equilibrium number of practitioners or prices of services to consumers, but is associated with significantly lower practitioner entry and exit rates. I further find states with more stringent licensing requirements to have more instructors and a larger median size of training facilities, suggesting possible barriers to entry for the training schools.

Modal Choice in Product Shipments: Analysis of Nonpublic Census Microdata,,"This paper explores how micro data within the Census itself can be used to supplement the Commodity Flow Survey (CFS). By establishing research using the raw CFS and other economic data collected at Census we gain a more comprehensive understanding of the uses of CFS data. This paper presents preliminary results from a project that examines the raw, non-public shipments data from the CFS linked to the corresponding non-public establishment data from the Census of Manufacturing (CM). Through a cooperative research program with the Census Center for Economic Studies (CES), the raw data from the CFS and CM have been linked. The raw data for the CFS are detailed shipment specific records for those establishments in the CFS sample. Each data element represents an individual shipment from that establishment, categorized by Standard Classification of Transported Goods (SCTG), mode, destination, and other economic characteristics. For any establishment in the CFS sample, multiple shipment records are common. The multiple data records representing each establishments’ shipment data have been linked to the establishment level data from the CM and the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL), also called the Business Register. The CM provides detailed data on the operations of the establishment for 1997; the SSEL provides detailed data on the location and firm ownership of the specific establishment. In particular the SSEL provides the establishment classification based on the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) and on the standard industrial classification (SIC) system. The data from the CFS has been linked to the CM and SSEL by using the appropriate permanent plant identifiers in the respective data bases.",2006,2006-01-01,1,"{'Gale Boyd', 'Anant Vyas', 'Marianne Mintz', 'Ki Young Park'}",,Global trade and economics,Transportation research circular,article,Marianne Mintz,https://openalex.org/A5010528551,FSRDC; Commodity Flow Survey; Census of Mining; Census Bureau,Commodity Flow Survey,Chicago
When Do Property Taxes Matter? Tax Salience and Heterogeneous Policy Effects,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4420998,"Taxes create incentives; yet, the potency of these incentives may depend on the salience and households’ perceptions of the tax itself. We investigate this issue in the context of property taxes, exploring how accurately households perceive their property tax liabilities and what factors determine misperception. Leveraging a unique national dataset, created by linking Zillow’s ZTRAX data to internal data from the American Community Survey, we first compare survey responses for how much households think they pay in property taxes to how much they actually pay based on municipal administrative records from ZTRAX. While homeowners’ tax perceptions are not substantially biased on average, we observe significant inaccuracy and systematic bias across different household(er) characteristics, institutional settings, and across states. Given that the vast majority of studies in the property tax capitalization literature use data concentrated in one state or locality, we also explore whether variation in tax misperceptions across states can help explain the heterogeneity in property tax effects on home prices. Results from a meta-analysis show that studies conducted in states with higher property tax misperceptions are significantly less likely to find property tax policy changes are fully capitalized into home prices.",2023,2023-01-01,3,"{'Marina Gindelsky', 'Scott Wentland', 'Jeremy G.

The analyses are conducted overall, within genders, and within racial and ethnic groups.Bilingualism is more prevalent if the parents are foreign born, less proficient in English, of the same ancestry (linguistic) group, and if the child lives in an ethnic (linguistic) concentration area. Although the effects are relatively smaller, a foreign-born grandparent living in the household increases child bilingualism, while a higher level of parental education tends to decrease it. Children of Asian and especially of Hispanic origin are more likely to be bilingual than their white, non-Hispanic counterparts.

Comments,https://doi.org/10.1353/urb.2004.0003,"Mark Duggan: During the past two decades, the U.S. prison population increased by a factor of four, with 1.36 million individuals in state and federal prisons by the end of 2002. An additional 0.80 million were held in local jails, juvenile facilities, and other correctional institutions during that same year.46 One consequence of this growth has been a steady rise in the number of individuals released from prison in each year. For example, approximately 550,000 individuals were released from state prisons in 1999, nearly half the number residing in state prisons at the end of the year. If, as previous studies suggest, these individuals are significantly more likely than the average person to commit crimes, it is plausible that the release of these prisoners has a substantial impact on area-level crime rates. Despite the obvious importance of this issue, no previous study has tackled this question head on. Most research has instead explored whether recently released prisoners violate the terms of their parole and are returned to custody within a certain time after release.47 While these studies have contributed a number of important findings, they cannot be used to estimate the effect of recently released prisoners on area-level crime rates for three reasons. First, individuals released from prison may commit a crime and yet not be caught by the authorities, which tends to understate their effect on crime. Or those released from prison may be targeted by authorities and arrested for crimes that they did not commit, thus to some extent overstating their contribution to crime rates. And [End Page 244] finally, a person released from prison may commit a significant number of crimes before being caught. Thus the outcome variables used in previous studies are clearly an imperfect measure of total criminal activity among recently released prisoners. In the current study, Steven Raphael and Michael Stoll address the research question outlined by estimating the contribution of recently released prisoners to state-level crime rates. To do this, the authors utilize a data set from the Bureau of Justice Statistics that includes the number of individuals released from prison and the number newly committed to prison in each state and in each year from 1977 to 1999.48 Combining these data with crime data from the FBI, demographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau, and unemployment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the authors investigate the hypothesis that crime increases in response to an increase in the number released from prison and declines when the number newly committed to prison increases. In essence, the authors are testing a reverse incapacitation effect in the first case and a pure incapacitation effect in the second case. There are several important findings in this study. First, the authors convincingly demonstrate that years in which states release a relatively high number of prisoners are followed by significant increases in crime while the opposite is true for the number imprisoned for the first time. Additionally, the authors find that the magnitude of these two effects is not equal—a person who is imprisoned appears to reduce crime by more than a person released from prison increases it. This is consistent with a number of possible hypotheses that predict criminal tendencies decline following imprisonment, including a positive effect of prison programs on earnings potential or a negative effect of parole supervision on the propensity to commit crime. Raphael and Stoll also find that the impact of prison releases was substantially greater early in the period (1978-84), suggesting that the person released from prison today is much less criminally active than his or her counterpart from two decades ago when prison populations were much lower. Finally, the authors demonstrate that prison releases are not significantly related to changes in crime in those states with powerful parole boards, perhaps because these states can selectively release those individuals who are least likely to commit crimes in the future.

Design Comparison of LODES and ACS Commuting Data Products,,"The Census Bureau produces two complementary data products, the American Community Survey (ACS) commuting and workplace data and the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES), which can be used to answer questions about spatial, economic, and demographic questions relating to workplaces and home-to-work flows.

Two Perspectives on Commuting: A Comparison of Home to Work Flows Across Job-Linked Survey and Administrative Files,,"Commuting flows and workplace employment data have a wide constituency of users including urban and regional planners, social science and transportation researchers, and businesses.

The Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program tabulates administrative records on jobs in the LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES). Design differences across the datasets lead to divergence in a comparable statistic: county-to-county aggregate commute flows. To understand differences in the public use data, this study compares ACS and LEHD source files, using identifying information and probabilistic matching to join person and job records. In our assessment, we compare commuting statistics for job frames linked on person, employment status, employer, and workplace and we identify person and job characteristics as well as design features of the data frames that explain aggregate differences. We find a lower rate of within-county commuting and farther commutes in LODES. We attribute these greater distances to differences in workplace reporting and to uncertainty of establishment assignments in LEHD for workers at multi-unit employers.

A Comparison of Training Modules for Administrative Records Use in Nonresponse Followup Operations: The 2010 Census and the American Community Survey,,"While modeling work in preparation for the 2020 Census has shown that administrative records can be predictive of Nonresponse Followup (NRFU) enumeration outcomes, there is scope to examine the robustness of the models by using more recent training data. The models deployed for workload removal from the 2015 and 2016 Census Tests were based on associations of the 2010 Census with administrative records. Training the same models with more recent data from the American Community Survey (ACS) can identify any changes in parameter associations over time that might reduce the accuracy of model predictions. Furthermore, more recent training data would allow for the incorporation of new administrative record sources not available in 2010. However, differences in ACS methodology and the smaller sample size may limit its applicability. This paper replicates earlier results and examines model predictions based on the ACS in comparison with NRFU outcomes.

The Transportation Transformation of Our Cities Will Be More Important Than Density Changes,,"This article addresses the following point of contention: 40 years, the average person will live closer to her neighbors and farther from the ground than she does today.In 40 years, U.S. metropolitan areas will be less dense and less automobile oriented. The transportation transformation of our cities, already well under way, will be more important to future urban policy than any measure of average metropolitan density.Population density in Manhattan peaked in 1910 and, as of 2010, had dropped by nearly one-half (Angel, 2012; Saywack, n.d.; U.S. Census Bureau, n.d.a). During the same timespan, the percentage of Americans living in census-defined urban areas increased from 46 to 81 percent (U.S. Census Bureau, n.d.b). So, one forecast would juxtapose those two facts-central city densities are declining and the world is becoming more urbanized-and would ask how those two forces will balance out. That balancing, however, would miss a key point.Approximately every two generations, we rebuild the transportation infrastructure in our cities in ways that shape the vitality of neighborhoods; the settlement patterns in our cities and countryside; and our economy, society, and culture. The Eisenhower Interstate Highway System, initiated in 1956, was the last such great transformation. We are well into a new wave of transportation transformation. Los Angeles is building six new rail transit lines, and, after those are complete, the world's prototypical automobile city will have a metrorail system longer than today's Washington Metro rail system (Boarnet, 2013). The best available data indicate that walking, as a percentage of all trips, increased in the United States from 2001 to 2009 (Pucher et al, 2009) and, during that same time period, walking mode share went up in 9 of the 10 largest U.S. metropolitan areas (Boarnet, 2013). In many of those 10 largest metropolitan areas, one-fifth of all trips are on foot. Driving, measured either by trips per driver or miles per driver, peaked sometime in the late 1990s in this country (Boarnet, 2013). Why the change? Two trends are important.First, gasoline is becoming more expensive. In 2002, a gallon of gasoline cost, in inflation-adjusted terms, about the same as it cost in 1978, but, since 2002, the inflation-adjusted cost of gasoline has increased by nearly 60 percent (data are from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, as cited in Boarnet, 2013). As China and India develop, increasing the global demand for oil, that trend is likely to continue.Second, and more important, the time cost of urban travel has also increased. The Texas Transportation Institute (Shrank et al., 2011) reports that highway delay hours in the largest metropolitan areas more than doubled from 1982 to 2010-that despite a drop in delay hours coincident with the 2008 recession. Urban highways are becoming expensive at precisely the same time that our primary transportation funding instrument, the fuel tax, generates declining revenues on a permile-traveled basis (Taylor, 1995, 2000). U.S. Department of Transportation data show that, nationwide, from 1980 to 2009 urban highway and arterial miles increased 73 percent, and urban-vehicle miles traveled on those roads increased 136 percent. We cannot build highways fast enough to keep up with increases in travel, not only because of Downs' (1962) well-known conjecture that more unpriced (or nontolled) roads will induce more travel (Duranton and Turner, 2011), but also because urban highways are becoming more expensive while our highway funds are shrinking relative to miles driven. The likelihood of more strict environmental regulations, including efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, will add pressure that favors infill development in ways that will increase street and highway traffic congestion.We have come to expect that new technologies will dramatically lower transportation costs (the driverless car seems the most recent of these ideas), but our urban areas are becoming more congested, if not more densely populated, and transportation innovations and available policies are not likely to change that trend toward more congested urban travel. …",2013,2013-09-01,1,{'Marlon G.

Deepening Megaregional Interrelatedness Through Migration: The Case of the Northern California Megaregion,https://doi.org/10.1111/grow.70010,"ABSTRACT The increasing connectedness between neighboring metropolitan areas anchored by global economic centers highlights the relevance of the megaregional scale for government and governance. Yet, there is a lack of data to examine the expansion of megaregions and understand prevalent challenges to coordination. We use data from the Census Bureau and the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) to analyze migration patterns within the Northern California Megaregion that combines the San Francisco Bay Area and California Central Valley and highlight different trends underlying regional expansion. We find that people are leaving Bay Area zip codes at the edge of the urbanized area where population growth is robust, migration rates lower, job accessibility is low, rents are nearly as high as the more central locations, and home values are lower, making it difficult to move elsewhere within the Bay Area. Moves into the Central Valley are divided between the suburbs of the main urban centers and isolated towns leading to fragmented growth that increases stress on transportation infrastructure and worsens spatial inequality in the region.",2024,2024-12-21,0,"{'Andre Comandon', 'Marlon G.

Characterizing the neighborhood risk environment in multisite clinic-based cohort studies: A practical geocoding and data linkages protocol for protected health information,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0278672,"Maintaining patient privacy when geocoding and linking residential address information with neighborhood-level data can create challenges during research. Challenges may arise when study staff have limited training in geocoding and linking data, or when non-study staff with appropriate expertise have limited availability, are unfamiliar with a study's population or objectives, or are not affordable for the study team. Opportunities for data breaches may also arise when working with non-study staff who are not on-site. We detail a free, user-friendly protocol for constructing indices of the neighborhood risk environment during multisite, clinic-based cohort studies that rely on participants' protected health information. This protocol can be implemented by study staff who do not have prior training in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and can help minimize the operational costs of integrating geographic data into public health projects. This protocol demonstrates how to: (1) securely geocode patients' residential addresses in a clinic setting and match geocoded addresses to census tracts using Geographic Information System software (Esri, Redlands, CA); (2) ascertain contextual variables of the risk environment from the American Community Survey and ArcGIS Business Analyst (Esri, Redlands, CA); (3) use geoidentifiers to link neighborhood risk data to census tracts containing geocoded addresses; and (4) assign randomly generated identifiers to census tracts and strip census tracts of their geoidentifiers to maintain patient confidentiality. Completion of this protocol generates three neighborhood risk indices (i.e., Neighborhood Disadvantage Index, Murder Rate Index, and Assault Rate Index) for patients' coded census tract locations. This protocol can be used by research personnel without prior GIS experience to easily create objective indices of the neighborhood risk environment while upholding patient confidentiality. Future studies can adapt this protocol to fit their specific patient populations and analytic objectives.",2022,2022-12-29,3,"{'Ariann Nassel', 'Akilah Dulin‐Keita', 'Sonia Napravnik', 'Deana Agil', 'Marta Wilson‐Barthes', 'Chanelle J.

Estimating Measurement Error in SIPP Annual Job Earnings: A Comparison of Census Bureau Survey and SSA Administrative Data,,"We quantify sources of variation in annual job earnings data collected by the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to determine how much of the variation is the result of measurement error. Jobs reported in the SIPP are linked to jobs reported in an administrative database, the Detailed Earnings Records (DER) drawn from the Social Security Administration’s Master Earnings File, a universe file of all earnings reported on W-2 tax forms. As a result of the match, each job potentially has two earnings observations per year: survey and administrative. Unlike previous validation studies, both of these earnings measures are viewed as noisy measures of some underlying true amount of annual earnings. While the existence of survey error resulting from respondent mistakes or misinterpretation is widely accepted, the idea that administrative data are also error-prone is new. Possible sources of employer reporting error, employee under-reporting of compensation such as tips, and general differences between how earnings may be reported on tax forms and in surveys, necessitates the discarding of the assumption that administrative data are a true measure of the quantity that the survey was designed to collect. In addition, errors in matching SIPP and DER jobs, a necessary task in any use of administrative data, also contribute to measurement error in both earnings variables. We begin by comparing SIPP and DER earnings for different demographic and education groups of SIPP respondents. We also calculate different measures of changes in earnings for individuals switching jobs. We estimate a standard earnings equation model using SIPP and DER earnings and compare the resulting coefficients. Finally exploiting the presence of individuals with multiple jobs and shared employers over time, we estimate an econometric model that includes random person and firm effects, a common error component shared by SIPP and DER earnings, and two independent error components that represent the variation unique to each earnings measure. We compare the variance components from this model and consider how the DER and SIPP differ across unobservable components.",2011,2011-07-01,3,"{'John M.

We apply the model to a sample of startups from five technological manufacturing industries while examining a range of variables grounded in prior work on startup human capital. The analysis is based on the Longitudinal Employer Household dynamics from the U.S. Census Bureau. Our findings indicate that, in the context of entrepreneurship, both startups and joiners rely heavily on signals of quality.

We theorize that both knowledge transfer (proxied by the exiting employee team size) and knowledge spillovers (proxied by experience of the exiting employee team) will aid spin-out performance. However, knowledge transfer, being more rival, will have a greater adverse impact than knowledge spillovers on parent firm performance.

A rising tide that lifts all boats: Long-term effects of the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend on poverty,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2444526/v1,"<title>Abstract</title> Although not designed as a social program to redistribute income, the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) program has been reducing relative income inequality for the past 40 years by providing equal annual payments to nearly all state residents. We examine specifically the direct effects of the PFD on Alaska poverty rates over the past several decades, with a particular focus on vulnerable populations: children, elders, and Indigenous peoples. Since children of all ages may receive a PFD, accurate measurement of the effect of the PFD requires adjusting for the under-reporting of income of children in government surveys generating official poverty statistics. After adjusting individual incomes of US Census and American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) households, we find that the PFD reduced Alaska poverty rates from 2.1 to 4.2 percentage points from 1990 through 2019. The effect of the PFD on ameliorating poverty has been even larger for vulnerable Alaska populations. The PFD has reduced poverty rates of rural Indigenous Alaskans from 28 percent to less than 22 percent. The PFD has also played an important role in alleviating of poverty among seniors and children. Aside from the special case of 2020, as much as 50 percent more Alaska children – 15 percent instead of 10 percent – would be living in poor families without PFD income.

Why is Productivity Correlated with Competition?,https://doi.org/10.3386/w25748,"DataTHERE are over 5000 ready-mix concrete establishments observed by the Census of Manufactures (CMF) in each year of my sample.Unfortunately, roughly one-third of these establishments are ""administrative records"" establishments; that is, they are small enough to be exempt from completing long-form census surveys.Census data for these establishments do exist, but they are generated from a combination of administrative records from other agencies and imputation, the latter of which makes them unusable for establishment-level productivity analysis.I therefore exclude all establishments that fall into this category.A second constraint is that a small handful of establishments in my sample are extensively diversified and operate in multiple SIC codes.This makes it difficult to construct a productivity residual for the ready-mix concrete portion of their business because data on their inputs are pooled at the establishment level, across all lines of production.I deal with this by excluding establishments for which less than 50% of their total sales is from ready-mix concrete.For diversified establishments that survive this exclusion, inputs devoted to ready-mix concrete are approximated by scaling the conflated input variable by the fraction of sales revenue from ready-mix concrete.Finally, I measure the establishment-level price of a cubic yard of concrete by dividing sales by quantity.I observe a small number of firms with extremal values, presumably generated by misreporting, and exclude them from the sample.It is important to note that while these establishments are excluded for regressions that depend on estimates of the productivity residuals, they are not excluded in the calculation of market-level variables; in particular, the competition indexes in Section 3.3, which are discussed below, use data for all establishments.In order to construct production function residuals as described in Section 3.4, I use data from the CMF at the establishment level for inputs, including energy, materials, equipment capital, structural capital, and labor.Energy and materials inputs are captured by expenditures reported by the CMF divided by two-digit deflators from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) productivity data base.Equipment and structural capital are the reported book value multiplied by two-digit capital rental rates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Finally, labor is taken as the number of production labor hours plus quality-adjusted nonproduction worker hours.Following Baily, Hulten, and Campbell (1992), the quality adjustment is the relative wage, so that total labor is simply production worker hours times the ratio of total wages to production wages.Production function input elasticities for the ready-mix concrete industry are presented in Table A.I.",2019,2019-04-01,3,{'Matthew Backus'},Columbia University,Economic theories and models; Economic Growth and Productivity; Global trade and economics,,report,Matthew R Backus,https://openalex.org/A5052002773,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue; Michigan RDC; Census of Manufactures,Census of Manufactures,Michigan
Interpolating Population Distributions using Public-use Data: An Application to Income Segregation using American Community Survey Data,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1802.02626,"Income segregation measures the extent to which households choose to live near other households with similar incomes. Sociologists theorize that income segregation can exacerbate the impacts of income inequality, and have developed indices to measure it at the metro area level, including the information theory index introduced in \citet{reardon2011income}, and the divergence index presented in \citet{roberto2015divergence}. To study their differences, we construct both indices using recent American Community Survey (ACS) estimates of features of the income distribution. Since the elimination of the decennial census long form, methods of computing these estimates must be updated to use ACS estimates and account for survey error. We propose a model-based method to interpolate estimates of features of the income distribution that accounts for this error. This method improves on previous approaches by allowing for the use of more types of estimates, and by providing uncertainty quantification. We apply this method to estimate U.S. census tract-level income distributions using ACS tabulations, and in turn use these to construct both income segregation indices. We find major differences between the two indices in the relative ranking of metro areas, as well as differences in how both indices correlate with the Gini index.",2018,2018-01-01,0,"{'Matthew J.

The Effect of Franchising on Establishment Performance in the U.S. Restaurant Industry,https://doi.org/10.1177/1938965518777970,"A central theme in much of the franchising literature is that franchising mitigates the Principle–agent problems between the owner of the franchise company and the operator of the local establishment by making the operator the owner-franchisee of the establishment. Despite the centrality of that assumption in the literature, there is little empirical evidence to support it. We use Census of Retail Trade data for essentially all full- and limited-service restaurants in the United States to test whether franchisee-ownership affects performance at the establishment level. We find a strong and robust franchise effect for full-service restaurants but little effect among limited-service restaurants. We argue this difference is consistent with agency costs given differences in work processes and the importance of managerial discretion.",2018,2018-06-04,22,"{'Michael E.

The Contextual Influences of Police and Social Service Providers on Formal Help-Seeking After Incidents of Intimate Partner Violence,https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260520915551,"Police notification and social service acquisition are two forms of formal help-seeking linked to improved outcomes among survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV), including better socio-emotional health, improved physical health, and, importantly, increased safety. The majority of research devoted to the study of formal help-seeking among survivors of IPV focuses on incident- and individual-level factors and their relationship with formal resource utilization. Much less is known about community-level factors. Using a nationally representative sample of incidents of IPV from the National Crime Victimization Survey (2006–2016), this work explores how law enforcement and social service resources in a community are related to police notification and survivor acquisition of a victim service after an incident of IPV, net of incident- and individual-level factors. Logistic regression models indicate that the number of law enforcement personnel per 1,000 residents in a county is positively associated with police notification after an incident of IPV, and it exerts an indirect effect on survivor service acquisition through police notification. Additional analyses reveal that the race/ethnicity of the survivor of IPV is a key demographic in the explanation of this relationship, as incidents of IPV involving White and Hispanic survivors of IPV are more likely to come to the attention of police as the number of law enforcement personnel increases. The reverse is true for incidents involving Black survivors of IPV. No differences across survivor sex emerged. Potential reasons to account for varying effects across race/ethnicity are discussed as well as the importance of additional funding for police and social service agencies to serve survivors of IPV and meet the dual goals of offender accountability and survivor safety and well-being.",2020,2020-05-18,10,"{'Katherine Calle Willyard', 'Megan Bears Augustyn'}",The University of Texas at San Antonio; Texas A&M University,Intimate Partner and Family Violence; Crime Patterns and Interventions; Sexual Assault and Victimization Studies,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,article,Megan Bears Augustyn,https://openalex.org/A5078515535,Police-Public Contact Survey; FSRDC; National Crime Victimization Survey; Texas RDC; Census Bureau,National Crime Victimization Survey,Texas

Commuter-Adjusted Population Estimates: ACS 2006-10,,"The concept of the daytime population refers to the number of people who are present in an area during typical business hours, including workers, children in school, people in hospitals or other short-term medical facilities, people temporarily staying in lodging facilities, and customers present at retail locations. This is in contrast to the “resident” population, which refers to people who reside in a given area and are typically present during the evening and nighttime hours. Information on the expansion or contraction of worker populations throughout a typical workday is important for a variety of community planning purposes. These purposes may include, for example, addressing transportation planning issues and disaster relief operations. The Census Bureau first published daytime population estimates using Census 2000 data. The estimates from Census 2000 are limited to the location of workers in a typical workday. No adjustments were made to account for the time of day commuters worked inside or outside specified areas or geographies. Thus, the estimates from Census 2000 are more accurately described as commuter-adjusted population estimates rather than the more familiar concept of daytime population estimates. This paper accompanies the release of the Census Bureau’s first commuter-adjusted population estimates based on the American Community Survey (ACS), and the first commuter-adjusted population release since that based on Census 2000. It summarizes commuter-adjusted population estimates for places, minor civil divisions (MCDs), counties, and states based on the 5-year 2006-2010 ACS estimates. The Census Bureau produces 1-year and 3-year ACS datasets, but only the 5-year datasets have a large enough sample to provide reliable estimates for smaller counties, MCDs, and places. The 2006-2010 ACS dataset was selected in order to provide a reasonable comparison with the Census 2000 estimates.

Welcome Mats and On‐Ramps for Older Adults: The Impact of the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid Expansions on Dual Enrollment in Medicare and Medicaid,https://doi.org/10.1002/pam.22259,"For many low-income Medicare beneficiaries, Medicaid provides important supplemental insurance that covers out-of-pocket costs and additional benefits. We examine whether Medicaid participation by low-income adults age 65 and up increased as a result of Medicaid expansions to working-age adults under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Previous literature documents so-called ""welcome mat"" effects in other populations but has not explicitly studied older persons dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. We extend this literature by estimating models of Medicaid participation among persons age 65 and up using American Community Survey data from 2010 to 2017 and state variation in ACA Medicaid expansions. We find that Medicaid expansions to working-age adults increased Medicaid participation among low-income older adults by 1.8 percentage points (4.4 percent). We also find evidence of an ""on-ramp"" effect; that is, low-income Medicare beneficiaries residing in expansion states who were young enough to gain coverage under the 2014 ACA Medicaid expansions before aging into Medicare were 4 percentage points (9.5 percent) more likely to have dual Medicaid coverage relative to similar individuals who either turned 65 before the 2014 expansions or resided in non-expansion states.

The Long-run Effects of Teacher Collective Bargaining,https://doi.org/10.3386/w24782,"Teacher collective bargaining is a highly debated feature of the education system in the US.This paper presents the first analysis of the effect of teacher collective bargaining laws on long-run labor market and educational attainment outcomes, exploiting the timing of passage of duty-tobargain laws across cohorts within states and across states over time.Using American Community Survey data linked to each respondent's state of birth, we examine labor market outcomes and educational attainment for 35-49 year olds, separately by gender.We find robust evidence that exposure to teacher collective bargaining laws worsens the future labor market outcomes of men: in the first 10 years after passage of a duty-to-bargain law, male earnings decline by $2,134 (or 3.93%) per year and hours worked decrease by 0.42 hours per week.The earnings estimates for men indicate that teacher collective bargaining reduces earnings by $213.8 billion in the US annually.We also find evidence of lower male employment rates, which is driven by lower labor force participation.Exposure to collective bargaining laws leads to reductions in the skill levels of the occupations into which male workers sort as well.Effects are largest among black and Hispanic men.Estimates among women are often confounded by secular trend variation, though we do find suggestive evidence of negative impacts among nonwhite women.Using data from the 1979",2018,2018-07-01,30,"{'Michael Lovenheim', 'Alexander Willén'}",National Bureau of Economic Research; Policy Analysis (United States); Cornell University; Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland; University of Mississippi; Norwegian School of Economics; Cornell University; Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland; Norwegian School of Economics; National Bureau of Economic Research; Policy Analysis (United States); University of Mississippi,Early Childhood Education and Development; Teacher Education and Leadership Studies; Education Discipline and Inequality,,report,Michael Lovenheim,https://openalex.org/A5070582112,American Community Survey; FSRDC; Cornell RDC; Decennial Census; Census Bureau,American Community Survey,Cornell
The Long-Run Effects of Teacher Collective Bargaining,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2815374,"This paper presents the first analysis of the effect of teacher collective bargaining on long-run labor market and educational attainment outcomes. Our analysis exploits the different timing across states in the passage of duty-to-bargain laws in a difference-in-difference framework to identify how exposure to teacher collective bargaining affects the long-run outcomes of students. Using American Community Survey (ACS) data linked to each respondent’s state of birth, we examine labor market outcomes and educational attainment for 35-49 year olds. Our estimates suggest that teacher collective bargaining worsens the future labor market outcomes of students: living in a state that has a duty-to-bargain law for all 12 grade-school years reduces earnings by $800 (or 2%) per year and decreases hours worked by 0.50 hours per week. The earnings estimate indicates that teacher collective bargaining reduces earnings by $199.6 billion in the US annually. We also find evidence of lower employment rates, which is driven by lower labor force participation, as well as reductions in the skill levels of the occupations into which workers sort. The effects are driven by men and nonwhites, who experience larger relative declines in long-run outcomes. Using data from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, we demonstrate that collective bargaining leads to sizable reductions in measured cognitive and non-cognitive skills among young adults.

Correcting for Survey Nonresponse Using Variable Response Propensity,https://doi.org/10.1198/jasa.2010.ap09485,"Abstract All surveys with less than full response potentially suffer from nonresponse bias. Poststratification weights can only correct for selection into the sample based on observables whose distribution is known in the population. Variables such as gender, race, income, and region satisfy this requirement because they are available from the U.S. Census Bureau, but poststratification based on these variables may not eliminate nonresponse bias. I develop an approach for correcting for nonignorable nonresponse bias. Survey respondents can be classified by their “response propensity.” Proxies for response propensity include the number of attempted phone calls, indicators of temporary refusal, and interviewer-coded measures of cooperativeness. We can then learn about the population of nonrespondents by extrapolating from the low-propensity respondents. I apply this new estimator to correct for unit nonresponse bias in the American National Election Study and in a CBS / New York Times preelection poll. I find that nonresponse bias can be a serious problem, particularly for items that relate to political participation. I find that my method is successful in substantially reducing nonresponse bias.

This paper studies firm entry and exit in foreign markets and their role in the post-recession recovery of U.S. exports using confidential microdata from the U.S. Census Bureau. We find that incumbent exporters account for the vast majority of the decline in export volumes during the crisis. The recession also induced a missing generation of exporters, with large increases in exits and a substantial decline in entries into foreign markets. New exporters during these years tended to have larger export volumes, however, compensating for the decline in the number of exporting firms. Thus, while entry and exit were important for determining the variety of U.S. goods that were exported, they were less important for the trajectory of aggregate foreign sales.",2017,2017-11-01,3,"{'Andrew H.

The Effect of Franchising on Establishment Performance in the U.S. Restaurant Industry,https://doi.org/10.1177/1938965518777970,"A central theme in much of the franchising literature is that franchising mitigates the Principle–agent problems between the owner of the franchise company and the operator of the local establishment by making the operator the owner-franchisee of the establishment. Despite the centrality of that assumption in the literature, there is little empirical evidence to support it. We use Census of Retail Trade data for essentially all full- and limited-service restaurants in the United States to test whether franchisee-ownership affects performance at the establishment level. We find a strong and robust franchise effect for full-service restaurants but little effect among limited-service restaurants.

The Effects of Outsourcing on the Elasticity of Labor Demand,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.837744,"In this paper, I focus on the effects of outsourcing on conditional labor demand elasticities. I begin by developing a model of outsourcing that formalizes this relationship. I show that the increased possibility of outsourcing (modeled as a decline in foreign intermediate input prices and an increase in the elasticity of substitution between foreign and domestic intermediate inputs) should increase labor demand elasticities. I also show that, a decline in the share of unskilled labor, due either to skill biased technological change or to movement of unskilled labor intensive stages abroad, can work in the opposite direction and reverse the increasing trend in elasticities. I then test the predictions of the model using the U.S. Census Bureau's Longitudinal Research Database (LRD). The instrumental variable approach used in the estimation of labor demand equations is the main methodological contribution of this paper.

Predicting the Effect of Adding a Citizenship Question to the 2020 Census,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-019-00803-4,"Abstract The addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census could affect the self-response rate, a key driver of the cost and quality of a census. We find that citizenship question response patterns in the American Community Survey (ACS) suggest that it is a sensitive question when asked about administrative record noncitizens but not when asked about administrative record citizens. ACS respondents who were administrative record noncitizens in 2017 frequently choose to skip the question or answer that the person is a citizen. We predict the effect on self-response to the entire survey by comparing mail response rates in the 2010 ACS, which included a citizenship question, with those of the 2010 census, which did not have a citizenship question, among households in both surveys. We compare the actual ACS–census difference in response rates for households that may contain noncitizens (more sensitive to the question) with the difference for households containing only U.S. citizens. We estimate that the addition of a citizenship question will have an 8.0 percentage point larger effect on self-response rates in households that may have noncitizens relative to those with only U.S. citizens. Assuming that the citizenship question does not affect unit self-response in all-citizen households and applying the 8.0 percentage point drop to the 28.1 % of housing units potentially having at least one noncitizen would predict an overall 2.2 percentage point drop in self-response in the 2020 census, increasing costs and reducing the quality of the population count.",2019,2019-07-17,28,"{'Misty L.

A Comparison of Training Modules for Administrative Records Use in Nonresponse Followup Operations: The 2010 Census and the American Community Survey,,"While modeling work in preparation for the 2020 Census has shown that administrative records can be predictive of Nonresponse Followup (NRFU) enumeration outcomes, there is scope to examine the robustness of the models by using more recent training data. The models deployed for workload removal from the 2015 and 2016 Census Tests were based on associations of the 2010 Census with administrative records. Training the same models with more recent data from the American Community Survey (ACS) can identify any changes in parameter associations over time that might reduce the accuracy of model predictions. Furthermore, more recent training data would allow for the incorporation of new administrative record sources not available in 2010. However, differences in ACS methodology and the smaller sample size may limit its applicability. This paper replicates earlier results and examines model predictions based on the ACS in comparison with NRFU outcomes.

Predicting the Effect of Adding a Citizenship Question to the 2020 Census,,"The addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census could affect the self-response rate, a key driver of the cost and quality of a census. We find that citizenship question response patterns in the American Community Survey (ACS) suggest that it is a sensitive question when asked about administrative record noncitizens but not when asked about administrative record citizens. ACS respondents who were administrative record noncitizens in 2017 frequently choose to skip the question or answer that the person is a citizen. We predict the effect on self-response to the entire survey by comparing mail response rates in the 2010 ACS, which included a citizenship question, with those of the 2010 census, which did not have a citizenship question, among households in both surveys. We compare the actual ACS-census difference in response rates for households that may contain noncitizens (more sensitive to the question) with the difference for households containing only U.S. citizens. We estimate that the addition of a citizenship question will have an 8.0 percentage point larger effect on self-response rates in households that may have noncitizens relative to those with only U.S. citizens. Assuming that the citizenship question does not affect unit self-response in all-citizen households and applying the 8.0 percentage point drop to the 28.1 % of housing units potentially having at least one noncitizen would predict an overall 2.2 percentage point drop in self-response in the 2020 census, increasing costs and reducing the quality of the population count.",2019,2019-01-01,0,"{'Misty L.

Hard to count: How survey and administrative records modeling can enhance census nonresponse followup1,https://doi.org/10.3233/sji-180447,"Previous studies have shown that modeling based on administrative records can be predictive of Nonresponse Followup (NRFU) enumeration outcomes in U.S. Census Bureau Decennial data collection operations. We compare model predictive power when varying training data sources and evaluate the extent to which survey data can be used to reduce enumerator workload when combined with available administrative data. We perform the evaluation using the 2010 Census and the 2014 American Community Survey. Our main finding is that a large survey-based training dataset, such as the American Community Survey, can provide results comparable to Census data. Robustness checks then illustrate that even small sample survey-based training datasets can also yield comparable predictions.

"Trends in fatal occupational injuries in Latino/a workers relative to other groups, North Carolina 2000–2017",https://doi.org/10.1002/ajim.23331,"Abstract Background Latino/a workers may experience higher fatal occupational injury rates than non‐Latino/a workers. In North Carolina, the Latino/a population more than doubled between 2000 and 2017. We examined fatal occupational injuries among Latino/a and non‐Latino/a workers in North Carolina over this period. Methods Information on fatal occupational injuries was abstracted from records of the North Carolina Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and the death certificate records held by the North Carolina Office of Vital Records. Estimates of the working population were derived from the decennial census and American Community Survey. Estimates of annual rates of fatal occupational injury for the period January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2017 were derived for Latino/a workers and compared to Black and White workers not identified as Latino/a. Results Over the study period, 1,783 fatal occupational injuries were identified among non‐Latino/a workers and 259 fatal occupational injuries among Latino/a workers in North Carolina. The majority of fatal occupational injuries among Latino/a workers occurred among males employed in construction and agriculture. While the fatal occupational injury rate among Latino/a workers declined over the study period, the rate among Latino/a workers was higher than among non‐Latino/a White and Black workers; moreover, fatal occupational injury rates for Latino/a workers trended upwards during the most recent years of the study period.

Trends in fatal occupational injury rates among older workers before and after the Great Recession of 2008,https://doi.org/10.1136/oemed-2022-108587,"Background Older workers experience higher rates of fatal occupational injury than younger workers worldwide. In North Carolina, the population of older workers more than doubled between 2000 and 2017. In 2008, the Great Recession changed occupational patterns among all age groups. We examined annual rates and distribution of fatal occupational injuries experienced by older workers, comparing the pre-recession period (2000–2007) to the post-recession period (2009–2017). Methods Detailed information on all fatal occupational injuries during the period between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2017 were abstracted from the records of the North Carolina Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and the office of vital records. The decennial Census and American Community Survey were used to estimate the population at risk and derive annual rates of fatal occupational injury. Results During the study period, 537 occupational fatalities occurred among workers 55+ years of age. The rate of fatal occupational injury among older workers declined 2.8% per year, with a 7.7% yearly decline in the pre-recession period compared with a 1.4% increase per year in the post-recession period. Workers 65+ years of age experienced rate increases in both periods. The highest rates of unintentional fatal occupational injury (injuries that were not purposefully inflicted) were observed in forestry, fishing hunting and trapping, and wood building manufacturing. Intentional fatal occupational injury rates (homicide, suicide) were highest in transportation, gas/service stations and grocery/food stores.

"Cultural Reproduction or Cultural Repertoire: Women Leaders, Legitimacy and Firm Performance in Family and Nonfamily Firms",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4766853,"Despite the equivocal findings that look to explain the ongoing implications for women leaders of family and nonfamily firms, little research has explored the underlying mechanisms that may enable or inhibit women leaders to be effective in their roles. Practice theory, rooted in sociology, looks at the dynamic interplay between structure and behaviors, while addressing the role of individual agency to help understand the formation, reproduction and changes in culture. We argue that nonfamily firms, having limited exposure and knowledge to a multiplicity of roles that women can take on, will categorize women leaders myopically in a traditional gender-stereotypical framework, thrusting on doubt and conflict and undermining her ability to lead. According to Bourdieu's argument of cultural reproduction, this symbolic violence will result in nonfamily firm women leaders' failure to be seen as legitimate, diminishing their ability to positively impact their firms. On the other hand, family firms, which have historically engaged women in a variety of family and business roles, have an expansive cultural repertoire of knowledge, skills and symbols to constructure new ""strategies of action."" Based on Swidler's cultural toolkit model, this vast cultural knowledge enables family firms to legitimize women's leadership roles, providing her with robust latitude and support in decision making and firm impact. Applying these cultural theories to data from the U.S. Census's Survey of Business Owners, and consistent with prior empirical findings, we show that women leaders of family firms reap higher levels of firm performance compared to their nonfamily firm counterparts.",2024,2024-01-01,1,"{'Myriam Quispe‐Agnoli', 'Eric Kushins'}",Berry College,"Family Business Performance and Succession; Entrepreneurship Studies and Influences; Migration, Ethnicity, and Economy",,preprint,Myriam Quispe-Agnoli,https://openalex.org/A5074172606,Survey of Business Owners; Census Bureau,Survey of Business Owners,Texas
PLURAL - Place-level urban-rural indices for the United States from 1930 to 2018,https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.22596946,"<strong>PLURAL (Place-level urban-rural indices)</strong> is a framework to create continuous classifications of ""rurality"" or ""urbanness"" based on the spatial configuration of populated places. PLURAL makes use of the concept of ""remoteness"" to characterize the level of spatial isolation of a populated place with respect to its neighbors. There are two implementations of PLURAL, including (a) PLURAL-1, based on distances to the nearest places of user-specified population classes, and (b) PLURAL-2, based on neighborhood characterization derived from spatial networks. PLURAL requires simplistic input data, i.e., the coordinates (x,y) and population p of populated places (villages, towns, cities) in a given point in time. Due to its simplistic input, the PLURAL rural-urban classification scheme can be applied to historical data, as well as to data from data-scarce settings. Using the PLURAL framework, we created place-level rural-urban indices for the conterminous United States from 1930 to 2018. Rural-urban classifications are essential for analyzing geographic, demographic, environmental, and social processes across the rural-urban continuum. Most existing classifications are, however, only available at relatively aggregated spatial scales, such as at the county scale in the United States. The absence of rurality or urbanness measures at high spatial resolution poses significant problems when the process of interest is highly localized, as with the incorporation of rural towns and villages into encroaching metropolitan areas. Moreover, existing rural-urban classifications are often inconsistent over time, or require complex, multi-source input data (e.g., remote sensing observations or road network data), thus, prohibiting the longitudinal analysis of rural-urban dynamics. We developed a set of distance- and spatial-network-based methods for consistently estimating the remoteness and rurality of places at fine spatial resolution, over long periods of time. Based on these methods, we constructed indices of urbanness for 30,000 places in the United States from 1930 to 2018. We call these indices the place-level urban-rural index (PLURAL), enabling long-term, fine-grained analyses of urban and rural change in the United States. The method paper has been peer-reviewed and is published in ""Landscape and Urban Planning"". The PLURAL indices from 1930 to 2018 are available as CSV files, and as point-based geospatial vector data (.SHP). Moreover, we provide animated GIF files illustrating the spatio-temporal variation of the different variants of the PLURAL indices, illustrating the dynamics of the rural-urban continuum in the United States from 1930 to 2018. <strong>Apply the PLURAL rural-urban classification to your own data: </strong>Python code is fully open source and available at https://github.com/johannesuhl/plural. <strong>Data sources:</strong> Place-level population counts (1980-2010) and place locations 1930 - 2018 were obtained from IPUMS NHGIS, (University of Minnesota, www.nhgis.org; Manson et al. 2022).

COVID-19–Related Stressors and Mental Health Disorders Among US Adults,https://doi.org/10.1177/00333549221120451,"Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to severe mental health repercussions. We examined rates of anxiety and depression in the United States during the pandemic by demographic characteristics, individual stressors, and COVID-19 infection rates and policy contexts. Methods: We merged data from the April 2020–March 2021 US Household Pulse Survey with state-level data on COVID-19 rates and mitigation policies, including stay-at-home orders, face mask mandates, and restaurant closures. We estimated weighted logistic regression models to assess correlates of anxiety and depression. Results: Rates of anxiety and depression peaked in late 2020 at 39% and 32%, respectively. Food insecurity and disrupted medical care were associated with more than twice the odds of anxiety and depression (food insecurity: odds ratio [OR] = 2.58 for anxiety and 2.61 for depression; disrupted medical care: OR = 2.40 and 2.27). Being not employed (OR = 1.32 for anxiety and 1.45 for depression), uninsured (OR = 1.30 and 1.38), housing insecure (OR = 1.41 and 1.34), and experiencing disruptions in education (OR = 1.28 and 1.25) were linked to 25% to 45% increased odds of anxiety and depression. Increases in state COVID-19 infection rates were associated with significantly heightened odds of anxiety and depression (OR = 1.01 for anxiety and depression), but state mitigation policies were not. Conclusions: Levels of anxiety and depression rose during the pandemic, particularly among economically vulnerable individuals and those experiencing economic and service disruptions.

An Assessment of the National Representativeness of Children in the 2007 Panel Study of Income Dynamics,,"There are many ways that nationally-representative samples drawn for panel surveys can become non-representative over time. For example, selective attrition and non-response, immigration, and shortcomings in the initial sample may lead to a divergence of the panel sample from the corresponding population it seeks to represent. Although initial cross-sectional weights together with attrition weights in later waves may correct for some sources of nonrepresentativeness, they do not correct for all possible sources. Furthermore, a periodic reassessment of sample representativeness is important for understanding the cumulative effects of attrition and immigration and determining whether additional measures are necessary to correct for declining representativeness and coverage. In this technical report, we assess the national representativeness of the 2007 sample of children in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)—a total of approximately 7,100 children aged 0–17 years of age. We evaluated the national coverage of the PSID child sample using microdata from the American Community Survey (ACS) and a new statistical technique called generalized boosted regression models. The ACS provides a gold-standard comparison based on its extremely high (98%) response rate, excellent data quality and completeness, and large sample sizes (approximately 700,000 children aged 0–17 years in 2007). We constructed a reasonably consistent set of covariates across PSID and ACS to describe children on the basis of their age, race/ethnicity, sex, poverty status, geographic region, and having a foreign-born parent. The generalized boosted models provided flexible, non-parametric estimates for assessing the relationship between our dependent variable (an indicator of whether an observation in the pooled ACS-PSID sample came from PSID) on covariates and their interactions. We also used the ACS sample to identify cases that are logically excluded from PSID (specifically, children whose parents are both post-1997 immigrants to the U.S.), and assess the size and composition of this group. Our results reveal that PSID child sample provides good representation of the corresponding national population with coverage of approximately 97% of the U.S. population of children in 2007 and reasonable balance for most groups, although with some exceptions.",2012,2012-01-01,13,"{'Narayan Sastry', 'Denise Duffy'}",,"Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Health disparities and outcomes; Survey Methodology and Nonresponse",,article,Narayan Sastry,https://openalex.org/A5008981357,BOC Best race and ethnicity administrative records file; American Community Survey; American Housing Survey,American Community Survey,Boston

The Industry Learning Environment and Firm Capital Structure,https://doi.org/10.5465/ambpp.2015.12963abstract,"We investigate how the importance of learning-by-doing in an industry is related to firm capital structure in that industry. Learning-by-doing, the improvement in business performance with operating experience, motivates firms to forgo current profits in return for future gains and results in intangible outputs that cannot be used as collateral. So, we hypothesize that firms in learning-intensive industries will be less reliant on debt. We find supporting evidence using data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Compustat on the U.S. manufacturing sector. Within-firm analysis shows that compared with other industries, firm growth in high-learning industries is associated with a lower increase in debt. Consistent with long-term debt being riskier than short-term debt, a difference-in-difference-type analysis reveals that these associations are stronger for long-term debt than for short-term debt. Together, these findings highlight a new implication of learning-by-doing for corporate finance decisions.",2015,2015-01-01,3,"{'Palash Deb', 'Natarajan Balasubramanian'}","Syracuse University; California State University, San Marcos",Corporate Finance and Governance; Firm Innovation and Growth; Corporate Taxation and Avoidance,Academy of Management Proceedings,article,Natarajan N Balasubramanian,https://openalex.org/A5054069581,Survey of Industrial Research and Development; Service Annual Survey; Foreign Trade Data - Import; Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Michigan

We illustrate this approach to evaluate the absolute disclosure risk framework, the counterfactual framework underlying differential privacy, and prior-to-posterior comparisons. We conclude that satisfying all the desiderata is impossible, but counterfactual comparisons satisfy the most while absolute disclosure risk satisfies the fewest. Furthermore, we explain that many of the criticisms levied against differential privacy would be levied against any technology that is not equivalent to direct, unrestricted access to confidential data.

Automation and the Workforce: A Firm-Level View from the 2019 Annual Business Survey,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4282509,"This paper describes the adoption of automation technologies by US firms across all economic sectors by leveraging a new module introduced in the 2019 Annual Business Survey, conducted by the US Census Bureau in partnership with the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES). The module collects data from over 300,000 firms on the use of five advanced technologies: AI, robotics, dedicated equipment, specialized software, and cloud computing. The adoption of these technologies remains low (especially for AI and robotics), varies substantially across industries, and concentrates on large and young firms. However, because larger firms are much more likely to adopt them, 12-64% of US workers and 22-72% of manufacturing workers are exposed to these technologies. Firms report a variety of motivations for adoption, including automating tasks previously performed by labor. Consistent with the use of these technologies for automation, adopters have higher labor productivity and lower labor shares. In particular, the use of these technologies is associated with a 11.4% higher labor productivity, which accounts for 20-30% of the difference in labor productivity between large firms and the median firm in an industry. Adopters report that these technologies raised skill requirements and led to greater demand for skilled labor but brought limited or ambiguous effects to their employment levels.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",2022,2022-01-01,51,"{'Pascual Restrepo', 'Nikolas Zolas', 'David N.

Business Dynamic Statistics of Innovative Firms,,"A key driver of economic growth is the reallocation of resources from low to high productivity activities. Innovation plays an important role in this regard by introducing new products, services, and business methods that ultimately lead to increased productivity and rising living standards. Traditional measures of innovation, particularly those based on aggregate inputs, are increasingly unable to capture the breadth and depth of innovation in modern economies. In this paper, we describe an effort at the US Census Bureau, the Business Dynamics Statistics of Innovative Firms (BDS-IF) project, which aims to address these challenges by extending the Business Dynamics Statistics data to include new measures of innovative activity. The BDS-IF project will produce measures of firm, establishment, and employment flows by firm age, firm size, and industry for the subset of firms engaged in activities related to innovation. These activities include patenting and trademarking, the employment of STEM workers, and R&D expenditures. The exibility of the underlying data infrastructure allows this measurement agenda to be extended to include copyright activity, management practices, and high growth firms.",2017,2017-01-01,5,"{'Nathan Goldschlag', 'Elisabeth Ruth Perlman'}",,Economic Growth and Productivity; Innovation Diffusion and Forecasting; Firm Innovation and Growth,RePEc: Research Papers in Economics,preprint,Nathan Goldschlag,https://openalex.org/A5069147408,Foreign Trade Data - Import; Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Boston

With these new data, we uncover several key trends for high-growth firms---critical engines of innovation and economic growth. First, the share of firms that are high-growth has steadily decreased over the past four decades, driven not only by falling rates of entrepreneurship but also languishing growth among existing firms. Second, this decline is particularly pronounced among young and small firms, while the share of high-growth firms has been relatively stable among large and old firms.

Where Have All the 'Creative Talents' Gone? Employment Dynamics of US Inventors,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4408143,"How are inventors allocated in the US economy and does that allocation affect innovative capacity? To answer these questions, we first build a model of creative destruction where an inventor with a new idea has the possibility to work for an entrant or incumbent firm. If the inventor works for the entrant the innovation is implemented and the entrant displaces the incumbent firm. Strategic considerations encourage the incumbent to hire the inventor, offering higher wages, and then not implement the inventorâ€™s idea. To test this prediction, we combine data on the employment history of over 760 thousand U.S. inventors with information on jobs from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Program at the U.S. Census Bureau.

Advanced Technologies Adoption and Use by U.S. Firms: Evidence from the Annual Business Survey,,"We introduce a new survey module intended to complement and expand research on the causes and consequences of advanced technology adoption. The 2018 Annual Business Survey (ABS), conducted by the Census Bureau in partnership with the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES), provides comprehensive and timely information on the diffusion among U.S. firms of advanced technologies including artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, robotics, and the digitization of business information. The 2018 ABS is a large, nationally representative sample of over 850,000 firms covering all private, nonfarm sectors of the economy. We describe the motivation for and development of the technology module in the ABS, as well as provide a first look at technology adoption and use patterns across firms and sectors. We find that digitization is quite widespread, as is some use of cloud computing. In contrast, advanced technology adoption is rare and generally skewed towards larger and older firms. Adoption patterns are consistent with a hierarchy of increasing technological sophistication, in which most firms that adopt AI or other advanced business technologies also use the other, more widely diffused technologies. Finally, while few firms are at the technology frontier, they tend to be large so technology exposure of the average worker is significantly higher. This new data will be available to qualified researchers on approved projects in the Federal Statistical Research Data Center network.",2020,2020-01-01,0,"{'Nikolas Zolas', 'David N.

"Where Have All the ""Creative Talents"" Gone? Employment Dynamics of Us Inventors",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4407493,"How are inventors allocated in the US economy and does that allocation affect innovative capacity? To answer these questions, we first build a model of creative destruction where an inventor with a new idea has the possibility to work for an entrant or incumbent firm. If the inventor works for the entrant the innovation is implemented and the entrant displaces the incumbent firm. Strategic considerations encourage the incumbent to hire the inventor, offering higher wages, and then not implement the inventor's idea. To test this prediction, we combine data on the employment history of over 760 thousand U.S. inventors with information on jobs from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Program at the U.S. Census Bureau. Our results show that (i) inventors are increasingly concentrated in large incumbents, less likely to work for young firms, and less likely to become entrepreneurs, and (ii) when an inventor is hired by an incumbent, compared to a young firm, their earnings increases by 12.6 percent and their innovative output declines by 6 to 11 percent.

Jones, and Sonya R. Porter. For more information, see https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/the-opportunity-atlas/. A summary of the related publication follows. We construct a publicly available atlas of children’s outcomes in adulthood by Census tract using anonymized longitudinal data covering nearly the entire U.S. population. For each tract, we estimate children’s earnings distributions, incarceration rates, and other outcomes in adulthood by parental income, race, and gender. These estimates allow us to trace the roots of outcomes such as poverty and incarceration back to the neighborhoods in which children grew up. We find that children’s outcomes vary sharply across nearby tracts: for children of parents at the 25th percentile of the income distribution, the standard deviation of mean household income at age 35 is $5,000 across tracts within counties. We illustrate how these tract-level data can provide insight into how neighborhoods shape the development of human capital and support local economic policy using two applications. First, we show that the estimates permit precise targeting of policies to improve economic opportunity by uncovering specific neighborhoods where certain subgroups of children grow up to have poor outcomes. Neighborhoods matter at a very granular level: conditional on characteristics such as poverty rates in a child’s own Census tract, characteristics of tracts that are one mile away have little predictive power for a child’s outcomes. Our historical estimates are informative predictors of outcomes even for children growing up today because neighborhood conditions are relatively stable over time. Second, we show that the observational estimates are highly predictive of neighborhoods’ causal effects, based on a comparison to data from the Moving to Opportunity experiment and a quasi-experimental research design analyzing movers’ outcomes. We then identify high-opportunity neighborhoods that are affordable to low-income families, providing an input into the design of affordable housing policies. Our measures of children’s long-term outcomes are only weakly correlated with traditional proxies for local economic success such as rates of job growth, showing that the conditions that create greater upward mobility are not necessarily the same as those that lead to productive labor markets.

Replication Data for: Race and Economic Opportunity in the United States: An Intergenerational Perspective,https://doi.org/10.7910/dvn/oulyje,"This dataset contains replication files for ""Race and Economic Opportunity in the United States: An Intergenerational Perspective"" by Raj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren, Maggie R. Jones, and Sonya R. Porter. For more information, see https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/race/. A summary of the related publication follows. We study the sources of racial and ethnic disparities in income using de-identified longitudinal data covering nearly the entire U.S. population from 1989-2015. We document three sets of results. First, the intergenerational persistence of disparities varies substantially across racial groups. For example, Hispanic Americans are moving up significantly in the income distribution across generations because they have relatively high rates of intergenerational income mobility. In contrast, black Americans have substantially lower rates of upward mobility and higher rates of downward mobility than whites, leading to large income disparities that persist across generations. Conditional on parent income, the black-white income gap is driven entirely by large differences in wages and employment rates between black and white men; there are no such differences between black and white women. Second, differences in family characteristics such as parental marital status, education, and wealth explain very little of the black-white income gap conditional on parent income. Differences in ability also do not explain the patterns of intergenerational mobility we document. Third, the black-white gap persists even among boys who grow up in the same neighborhood. Controlling for parental income, black boys have lower incomes in adulthood than white boys in 99% of Census tracts. Both black and white boys have better outcomes in low-poverty areas, but black-white gaps are larger on average for boys who grow up in such neighborhoods. The few areas in which black-white gaps are relatively small tend to be low-poverty neighborhoods with low levels of racial bias among whites and high rates of father presence among blacks. Black males who move to such neighborhoods earlier in childhood earn more and are less likely to be incarcerated. However, fewer than 5% of black children grow up in such environments. These findings suggest that reducing the black-white income gap will require efforts whose impacts cross neighborhood and class lines and increase upward mobility specifically for black men.

Debt Sustainability in a Low Interest Rate World,,"Drawing on a new, confidential Census Bureau dataset of financial statements of a representative sample of 80000 manufacturing firms from 1977 and 2014, we provide new evidence on the link between size, cyclicality, and financial frictions. First, we only find evidence of lower cyclicality among the very largest firms (the top 1% by size). Second, due to high and rising concentration of sales and investment, the lower sensitivity of the top 1% firms dominates the behavior of aggregate fluctuations. Third, we show that this differential sensitivity does not appear to be driven by financial frictions. The higher sensitivity of the bottom 99% does not disappear after controlling for measures of financial strength, is not statistically significant after identified monetary policy shocks, and does not appear in debt financing flows. Evidence from 3-digit industries suggests a non-financial explanation: the largest 1% of firms are less sensitive due to a more diversified customer base.",2018,2018-01-01,15,{'Neil Mehrotra'},,"Sustainable Finance and Green Bonds; Banking stability, regulation, efficiency; Housing Market and Economics",RePEc: Research Papers in Economics,preprint,Neil R Mehrotra,https://openalex.org/A5054685521,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue; Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue; Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Chicago

Navigating Statistical Uncertainty: How Urban and Regional Planners Understand and Work With American Community Survey (ACS) Data for Guiding Policy,https://doi.org/10.1080/01944363.2018.1440182,"Problem, research strategy, and findings: The American Community Survey (ACS) is a crucial source of socio­demographic data for planners. Since ACS data are estimates rather than actual counts, they contain a degree of statistical uncertainty—referred to as margin of error (MOE)—that planners must navigate when using these data. The statistical uncertainty is magnified when one is working with data for small areas or subgroups of the population or cross-tabulating demographic characteristics. We interviewed (n = 7) and surveyed (n = 200) planners and find that many do not understand the statistical uncertainty in ACS data, find it difficult to communicate statistical uncertainty to stakeholders, and avoid reporting MOEs altogether. These practices may conflict with planners' ethical obligations under the AICP Code of Ethics to disclose information in a clear and direct way.Takeaway for practice: We argue that the planning academy should change its curriculum requirements and that the profession should improve professional development training to ensure planners understand data uncertainty and convey it to users. We suggest planners follow 5 guidelines when using ACS data: Report MOEs, indicate when they are not reporting MOEs, provide context for the level of statistical reliability, consider alternatives for reducing statistical uncertainty, and always conduct statistical tests when comparing ACS estimates.",2018,2018-04-03,22,"{'David C.

UrbanPop: A spatial microsimulation framework for exploring demographic influences on human dynamics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2022.102844,"Ensuring the social equity of planning measures in social systems requires an understanding of human dynamics, particularly how individual relationships, activities, and interactions intersect with individual needs. Spatial microsimulation models (SMSMs) support planning for human security goals by representing human dynamics through realistic, georeferenced synthetic populations, that a) provide a complete representation of social systems while b) also protecting individual privacy. In this paper, we present UrbanPop, an open and reproducible SMSM framework for analysis of human dynamics with high spatial, temporal, and demographic resolution. UrbanPop creates synthetic populations of demographically detailed worker and student agents, positioning them first at probable nighttime locations (home), then moving them to probable daytime locations (work/school). Summary aggregations of these populations match the granular detail available at the census block group level in the American Community Survey Summary File (SF), providing realistic approximations of the actual population. UrbanPop users can select particular demographic traits important in their application, resulting in a highly tailored agent population.

Who are the People in my Neighborhood?: The “Contextual Fallacy” of Measuring Individual Context with Census Geographies,https://doi.org/10.1111/gean.12192,"Scholars frequently use counts of populations aggregated into geographic units like census tracts to represent measures of neighborhood context. Decades of research confirm that variation in how individuals are aggregated into geographic units can dramatically alter analyses conducted with these units. While most researchers are aware of the problem, they have lacked the tools to determine its magnitude or its capacity to affect analytical results obtained using these contextual measures. Using confidential access to the complete 2010 U.S. Decennial Census, we can construct—for all persons in the U.S.—individual‐specific contexts, which we group according to Census‐assigned block, block group, and tract. We compare these individual‐specific measures to the published statistics at each scale, and we then determine the degree to which published measures could be affected by how boundaries are drawn using a simple statistic, the standard deviation of individual context (SDIC). For three key measures (percent Black, percent Hispanic, and Entropy—a measure of ethno‐racial diversity), we find that block‐level Census statistics frequently contain a high degree of uncertainty meaning that they may not capture the actual context of individuals within them. More problematic, we uncover systematic spatial patterns in the uncertainty associated with contextual variables at all three scales.",2019,2019-02-21,32,"{'David C.

The spatial distribution of neighborhood safety ties: Consequences for perceived collective efficacy?,https://doi.org/10.1080/07352166.2023.2192940,"ABSTRACTABSTRACTThere is conflicting evidence in the literature regarding the relationship between residents’ social networks and their perceptions of neighborhood collective efficacy. This study proposes addressing this challenge with several theoretically motivated refinements using a large spatially stratified sample of residents in the Western United States. First, we consider various distinct types of social relationships, and find that our novel measure of neighborhood safety ties is much more strongly related to perceived collective efficacy than is a measure of socializing relationships. Second, we explicitly account for the spatial distribution of ties, and find that it is not just local neighborhood ties that increase a sense of cohesion or informal social control, but that more spatially distant ties also matter. Third, we make a distinction between urban and rural areas, finding that in rural areas, social ties from an even broader area are associated with stronger feelings of collective efficacy.KEYWORDS: Neighborhoodssocial networksspatial effectscollective efficacy Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Additional informationFundingThis research is supported in part by NSF grants [IIS-1526736 and BCS-0827027].Notes on contributorsJohn R.

INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND THE COMPOSITION OF LABOR MARKET TURNOVER,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1465-7295.2011.00451.x,"The composition of labor market turnover is shown to influence patterns of international trade. Job and worker turnover have opposing marginal effects on industry export intensity, highlighting the importance of relative turnover shares on either side of the labor market, as opposed to total volumes of labor mobility, in shaping economic outcomes. Industries with relatively greater shares of worker turnover export more of total production, and those with higher job turnover export less. Furthermore, relatively high job turnover hinders industry adjustment following trade liberalization. These predictions receive support for U.S. manufacturing industries using turnover data in the Quarterly Workforce Indicators available from the U.S. Census Bureau.

Credit Market Competition and the Nature of Firms,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1444479,"Empirical studies show that competition in the credit markets has important effects on the entry and growth of firms in nonfinancial industries. This paper explores the hypothesis that the availability of credit at the time of a firm’s founding has a profound effect on that firm’s nature. I conjecture that in times when financial capital is difficult to obtain, firms will need to be built as relatively solid organizations. However, in an environment of easily available financial capital, firms can be constituted with an intrinsically weaker structure. To test this conjecture, I use confidential data from the U.S. Census Bureau on the entire universe of business establishments in existence over a thirty-year period; I follow the life cycles of those same establishments through a period of regulatory reform during which U.S. states were allowed to remove barriers to entry in the banking industry, a development that resulted in significantly improved credit competition. The evidence confirms my conjecture. Firms constituted in post-reform years are intrinsically frailer than those founded in a more financially constrained environment, while firms of pre-reform vintage do not seem to adapt their nature to an easier credit environment.

Are China and India Backwards? Evidence from the 19th Century U.S. Census of Manufactures,,"Hsieh and Klenow (2009) argue that a large fraction of aggregate TFP differences between the U.S. and the developing countries of China and India can be explained by capital misallocation. Their interpretation is that this misallocation is due to institutions and policies that distort resources away from productive firms in these developing countries. Using the U.S. Census of Manufactures from the late 19th century, I find that the level of dispersion in these modern, less developed countries is very similar to that in the U.S. at this time. What these countries share are not similar institutions rather similar levels of economic development. The institutions of the U.S. at this time were much better than India or China in terms of protecting property rights and allocating resources. This suggests that the Hsieh-Klenow measure of imperfections is not related to institutions but simply the level of development.

Automation and the Workforce: A Firm-Level View from the 2019 Annual Business Survey,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4282509,"This paper describes the adoption of automation technologies by US firms across all economic sectors by leveraging a new module introduced in the 2019 Annual Business Survey, conducted by the US Census Bureau in partnership with the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES).

The adoption of these technologies remains low (especially for AI and robotics), varies substantially across industries, and concentrates on large and young firms. However, because larger firms are much more likely to adopt them, 12-64% of US workers and 22-72% of manufacturing workers are exposed to these technologies.

The Promise and Peril of Entrepreneurship,https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/13873.001.0001,"A clearer view of entrepreneurship, based on new comprehensive data, that upends what we know about job creation and survival among US startups. Startups create jobs and power economic growth. That's an article of faith in the United States—but, as The Promise and Peril of Entrepreneurship reveals, our faith may be built on shaky ground. Economists Robert Fairlie, Zachary Kroff, Javier Miranda, and Nikolas Zolas—working with Census Bureau microdata—have developed a new data set, the Comprehensive Startup Panel, that tracks job creation and the survival of every startup in the country. In doing so, they recalibrate our understanding of how startups behave in the US economy. Specifically, their work seeks to answer three critical questions: How many jobs does each entrepreneur create? Do those jobs disappear quickly? And how long do entrepreneurial enterprises survive? Job creation and survival rates are, the authors conclude, much lower than those reported by official federal sources. Such discrepancies emerge from the more comprehensive picture drawn from this new data set—a picture that, for instance, highlights the important but understudied differences between employer firms (startups that hire people) and nonemployer firms (startups that do not initially hire people but may do so in later years as they grow). This reframing captures the vast number of businesses that start with no employees, a number largely missing from the statistics underpinning the mythos of the riskiness of entrepreneurship. The book also explores who owns startups—focusing on differences by race and ethnicity. With its new, wider view of the realities of job creation and survival among startups, The Promise and Peril of Entrepreneurship has significant implications for economic policymaking and research, and for the billions of dollars that the government and the private sector invest in promoting entrepreneurship.",2023,2023-06-29,6,"{'Javier Miranda', 'Nikolas Zolas', 'Robert W.

Advanced Technologies Adoption and Use by U.S. Firms: Evidence from the Annual Business Survey,,"We introduce a new survey module intended to complement and expand research on the causes and consequences of advanced technology adoption. The 2018 Annual Business Survey (ABS), conducted by the Census Bureau in partnership with the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES), provides comprehensive and timely information on the diffusion among U.S. firms of advanced technologies including artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, robotics, and the digitization of business information. The 2018 ABS is a large, nationally representative sample of over 850,000 firms covering all private, nonfarm sectors of the economy. We describe the motivation for and development of the technology module in the ABS, as well as provide a first look at technology adoption and use patterns across firms and sectors. We find that digitization is quite widespread, as is some use of cloud computing. In contrast, advanced technology adoption is rare and generally skewed towards larger and older firms. Adoption patterns are consistent with a hierarchy of increasing technological sophistication, in which most firms that adopt AI or other advanced business technologies also use the other, more widely diffused technologies. Finally, while few firms are at the technology frontier, they tend to be large so technology exposure of the average worker is significantly higher. This new data will be available to qualified researchers on approved projects in the Federal Statistical Research Data Center network.",2020,2020-01-01,0,"{'Nikolas Zolas', 'David N.

Association of the Implementation of Child Tax Credit Advance Payments With Food Insufficiency in US Households,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.43296,"<h3>Importance</h3> A key component of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 included an expansion of the Child Tax Credit with advance payments beginning in July 2021, a “child allowance” that was projected to dramatically reduce child poverty. Food insufficiency has increased markedly during the economic crisis spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, with disparities among marginalized populations, and may be associated with substantial health care and social costs. <h3>Objective</h3> To assess whether the introduction of advance payments for the Child Tax Credit in mid-July 2021 was associated with changes in food insufficiency in US households with children. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> This cross-sectional study used data from several phases of the Household Pulse Survey, conducted by the US Census Bureau from January 6 to August 2, 2021. The survey had 585 170 responses, representing a weighted population size of 77 165 153 households. <h3>Exposure</h3> The first advance Child Tax Credit payment, received on July 15, 2021. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Household food insufficiency. <h3>Results</h3> The weighted sample of 585 170 respondents was mostly female (51.5%) and non-Hispanic White (62.5%), with a plurality aged 25 to 44 years (48.1%), having a 4-year degree or more (34.7%) and a 2019 household income of $75 000 to $149 999 (23.1%). In the weeks after the first advance payment of the Child Tax Credit was made (July 21 to August 2, 2021), 62.4% of households with children reported receiving it compared with 1.1% of households without children present (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). There was a 3.7–percentage point reduction (95% CI, –0.055 to –0.019 percentage points;<i>P</i> &lt; .001) in household food insufficiency for households with children present in the survey wave after the first advance payment of the Child Tax Credit, corresponding to a 25.9% reduction, using an event study specification. Difference-in-differences (−16.4%) and modified Poisson (−20.8%) models also yielded large estimates for reductions in household food insufficiency associated with the first advance payment of the expanded Child Tax Credit. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> This study suggests that the Child Tax Credit advance payment increased household income and may have acted as a buffer against food insufficiency. However, its expansion and advance payment are only a temporary measure for 2021. Congress must consider whether to extend these changes or make them permanent and improve implementation to reduce barriers to receipt for low-income families.",2022,2022-01-13,85,"{'Paul Shafer', 'Katherine M.

These monthly payments expired in January 2022 after Congress failed to extend the policy, and the subsequent impact on food insufficiency is currently unknown.To assess whether the expiration of monthly CTC payments in January 2022 was associated with changes in food insufficiency in US households with children.This study used repeated cross-sectional, nationally representative data from multiple waves of the Household Pulse Survey, conducted by the US Census Bureau. Online data collection occurred from July 21, 2021, to July 11, 2022, and data analysis was performed in July 2022.The first missed advance CTC payment on January 15, 2022.The main outcome was unadjusted prevalence of household food insufficiency. Event study specification was used to estimate the association between the expiration of the CTC payments and household food insufficiency with the exposure of being in a household with children present.The sample (592 044 respondents, representing households with and without children, for a weighted population size of 123 350 770 individuals) was majority female (362 286 individuals [51.3%]) and non-Hispanic White (425 497 individuals [62.2%]), and a plurality of respondents (248 828 [48.3%]) were aged 25 to 44 years at the time of the survey. During the survey wave just before CTC expiration (reference wave, December 29, 2021, to January 10, 2022), unadjusted household food insufficiency was 12.7% among households with children. In late January and early February 2022, following the first missed CTC monthly payment, 13.6% of households with children reported food insufficiency, increasing to 16.0% by late June and early July 2022.

Geocoded Medicaid office locations in the United States,https://doi.org/10.7910/dvn/avrhmi,"Big “p” policy changes at the state and federal level are certainly important to health equity, such as eligibility for and generosity of Medicaid benefits. Medicaid expansion has significantly expanded the number of people who are eligible for Medicaid and the creation of the health insurance exchanges (Marketplace) under the Affordable Care Act created a very visible avenue through which people can learn that they are eligible. Although many applications are now submitted online, physical access to state, county, and tribal government Medicaid offices still plays a critical role in understanding eligibility, getting help in applying, and navigating required documentation for both initial enrollment and redetermination of eligibility. However, as more government functions have moved online, in-person office locations and/or staff may have been cut to reduce costs, and gentrification has shifted where minoritized, marginalized, and/or low-income populations live, it is unclear if this key local connection point between residents and Medicaid has been maintained. Our objective was to identify and geocode all Medicaid offices in the United States for pairing with other spatial data (e.g., demographics, Medicaid participation, health care use, health outcomes) to investigate policy-relevant research questions. Three coders identified Medicaid office addresses in all 50 states and the District of Columbia by searching state government websites (e.g., Department of Health and Human Services or analogous state agency) during late 2021 and early 2022 for the appropriate Medicaid agency and its office locations, which were then reviewed for accuracy by a fourth coder. Our corpus of Medicaid office addresses was then geocoded using the Census Geocoder from the US Census Bureau (https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/) with unresolved addresses investigated and/or manually geocoded using Google Maps. The corpus was updated in August through December 2023 following the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency by a fifth coder as several states closed and/or combined offices during the pandemic. After deduplication (e.g., where multiple counties share a single office) and removal of mailing addresses (e.g., PO Boxes), our final dataset includes 3,026 Medicaid office locations. 1.0 (December 19, 2023) – original version 2.0 (January 25, 2024) – added related publication (Data in Brief), corrected two records that were missing negative signs in longitude",2023,2023-01-01,1,"{'Paul Shafer', 'Alexandra Skinner', 'Pierce H.

Expanded unemployment benefits and their implications for health during the <scp>COVID</scp>‐19 pandemic,https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6773.13881,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has roiled the world since early 2020, which has resulted in over 220 million infections and over 4.5 million deaths as of early September 2021.1 The United States has recently struggled to contain a resurgence of cases associated with the more transmissible Delta variant,2 leading to hospitals again reaching capacity and many states, municipalities, and institutions to re-institute precautions, such as mask mandates and testing requirements, as well as many employers beginning to require that their employees be vaccinated.3-5 Early on, as the United States and the world were still coming to grips with the challenge that we were collectively facing, public health measures to stem the spread of COVID-19 led to a need to support workers who had become unemployed during this pandemic-induced economic crisis. In the United States, unemployment peaked at 14.8% and labor force participation fell to 60.2% in April 2020—their worst in decades.6 Black and Latinx populations experienced the double jeopardy of having disproportionately higher unemployment rates while those still working faced relatively greater COVID exposure risks as essential and frontline workers.6-10 The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020 by President Donald J. Trump,11 including a Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) program that added a $600 weekly supplement to state unemployment insurance (UI) benefits designed to help Americans manage the evolving pandemic financially.12 FPUC ended in July 2020 before being partially reinstated in January 2021 at half the original amount ($300 weekly supplement). Other measures to support workers included the following: (1) Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC), also part of the CARES Act and extended in the American Rescue Plan Act, which extended benefits for up to 53 weeks once state benefits are exhausted; (2) Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), which extends UI benefits to those not traditionally eligible (e.g., self-employed, independent contractors); and (3) Mixed Earners Unemployment Compensation (MEUC), which supports those with eligibility for regular UI benefits who also have income from traditionally ineligible sources. The PUA and MEUC programs are particularly important for equity. Our UI system was designed to disadvantage Black and Latinx workers from the beginning by excluding certain occupations and work arrangements as well as a federalist approach to implementation, which resulted in wide variation in generosity and investment on the part of states, similar to Medicaid.13-15 In this issue, Evangelist, Wu, and Shaefer focus on a key question—how did expanded UI benefits affect health care spending?16 The authors describe how health care use early in the pandemic plummeted for both routine and emergent non-COVID-related care, with concerns about health care costs in the face of large increases in unemployment thought to play a key role alongside reductions in availability of in-person care and avoidance of exposure risk. But disentangling these various motives, as well as state-level differences in UI eligibility on top of the effect of FPUC, was no small feat. The authors used aggregated debit and credit card transaction data at the state-week level obtained from Opportunity Insights for January to August 2020, which captured approximately 10% of US transactions. This approach provided a seasonally adjusted index of health care spending relative to pre-pandemic levels. Their triple differences framework exploits variation in the UI claims rate and availability of FPUC, separating state-level UI benefit eligibility and generosity from the enhanced payment to those receiving UI benefits while also controlling for Economic Impact Payments made in April 2020. They find that health care spending fell by 1.0% from pre-pandemic levels for every percentage point increase in UI claims rate across all states, with a similarly sized effect in Medicaid expansion states (−1.0%) but double in non-expansion states (−2.0%). Without that pathway to coverage and potentially facing the full price for any health care used, it seems plausible that many individuals and families would choose to simply defer care. FPUC offset approximately half of the decline in health care spending associated with increasing unemployment, though it was only significant at the 10% level. However, when stratified by Medicaid expansion status, FPUC offset 80% of the unemployment-related decline in health care spending in expansion states compared with 65% in non-expansion states. This protective effect of FPUC against reductions in health care spending also carried over to all consumer spending, which has implications for spending on food, housing, transportation, and other needs. A considerable limitation of this study is the authors' inability to separate current spending (i.e., copayments at time of visit) from paying for past health care (i.e., cost-sharing from past visits) in their data, which led the authors to make clear that their focus is on spending rather than utilization. Patients could have deferred or chose not to pay bills for past care to increase savings or cover other expenses without necessarily sacrificing current health care use, or they could have done the opposite to avoid going to collections. Also, the inability to capture spending on prescriptions is unfortunate as medication adherence is key for chronic disease management. Observing how reductions in or loss of UI benefits affect medication adherence could potentially bolster the case for continuing UI expansions as a means of protecting against greater non-COVID-related health consequences of the pandemic. Another important consideration is that low-income individuals and Black and Latinx populations are considerably more likely to be unbanked or underbanked, which means that they lack access to a checking, savings, or money market account or use them in combination with alternative financial instruments like payday or title loans.17 This presents a generalizability problem for their study; however, it seems plausible that this bias toward the banked population could understate the size of their observed effects. That said, the unbanked may also face larger barriers to consistent receipt of UI benefits (e.g., checks by mail rather than direct deposit) and likely have worse access to care (e.g., greater chance of being uninsured) so the effect of their inclusion on the findings may be ambiguous. There have been documented improvements in food insecurity, mental health, health-related social needs, and access to health care associated with receiving UI during the COVID-19 pandemic,18-20 which provide important context for this study and our continued policy responses to this crisis. Raifman, Bor, and Venkataramani used data from an online nationally representative longitudinal cohort between April and November 2020, and they found that receipt of UI with FPUC was associated with nearly double the reduction in food insecurity compared to UI without FPUC (−5.9 percentage points vs. −3.0).18 Berkowitz and Basu used data from the cross-sectional Household Pulse Survey conducted by the US Census Bureau to investigate a range of outcomes, and they found relative risk reductions for food insufficiency, missing housing payments, delays in health care, and symptoms of depression (PHQ-2) and anxiety (GAD-2) associated with receipt of UI benefits during June and July 2020.19 All the previously highlighted federal UI expansions lapsed in early September 2021, which kicked an estimated 7.5 million Americans off of UI benefits.21 However, about half of the states chose to opt out of some or all of these supplemental UI expansions earlier, with many states doing so as early as June, claiming that overly generous benefits were the reason that employers were having difficulty filling job openings.22 Early evidence suggests that this has not borne itself out in a rapid decrease in unemployment that governors may have expected. A recent working paper using financial services data found that ending expanded UI benefits in states that did so early only increased employment by 4 percentage points while reducing UI receipt by 35 percentage points through early August 2021 among those who had been unemployed and on UI at the end of April 2021.23 The authors found that new earnings from employment only offset 5% of the lost UI benefits on average, with total weekly spending falling by 20%.23 Another analysis that is pre-registered but yet to be peer-reviewed found that net employment did not seem to be responsive to ending expanded UI benefits.24 These results suggest that the termination of pandemic UI benefits will create only pain for American households, which will reverse their protective effects on health and health-related social needs, without the promised or imagined labor market effects. The COVID-19 pandemic is not yet over despite our collective desire for things to return to normal. Expanded unemployment benefits and other expansions of the patchwork social safety net in the United States, such as increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, are key to supporting individuals and families through this crisis. The long-run effects on health equity and income inequality of withdrawing public health measures and financial supports too soon will be disastrous if low-income and minoritized populations are forced to disproportionately bear the costs of this pandemic in ways that will reverberate for years and generations to come.

Productivity growth patterns in US dairy products manufacturing plants,https://doi.org/10.1080/00036841003636326,"We analyse the productivity growth patterns in the US dairy products industry using the Census Bureau's plant-level data set. We decompose Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth into the scale and technical change components and analyse variability of plants' productivity by constructing transition matrices. We observe a cross-sectional dispersion in plant-level productivity growth in the industry. Even though the industry aggregate shows a small TFP growth rate −0.3%, quartile rank analysis shows that while the lowest productivity quartile plants average 1.9% loss in productivity, the highest productivity quartile plants average 1.1% growth annually. Our results show considerable movements of plants in their productivity rank categories overall and across age groups, and we find that the scale effect contribution to TFP growth accounts for about 90% of TFP growth on average in the industry. These plants extract scale efficiencies over technological progress to fuel TFP growth. The youngest plants start with the lowest productivity growth at the initial time period, but they catch up older plants productivity, which present the highest average growth rate through years. This may indicate a 'learning-by-doing' process for the industry.",2010,2010-10-15,9,"{'Pinar Celikkol Geylani', 'Spiro E.

There are differences in productivity growth and investment spike patterns across different sub-industries and food manufacturing industry in general. Our study finds empirical support for the learning-by-doing hypothesis by identifying some cases where the impact of investment spikes on TFP growth presents a U-shaped investment age–productivity growth pattern. However, efficiency and the learning period associated with investment spikes differ among plants across industries. The most pronounced impact of investment age on productivity growth (5.3 % for meat products, 4% for dairy products, and 2.8 % in all food manufacturing plants) occurs during the fifth year of post-investment spike.

"Gender, race/ethnicity, and entrepreneurship: women entrepreneurs in a US south city",https://doi.org/10.1108/ijebr-05-2017-0156,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how gender, interacting with race and ethnicity, plays a role in women entrepreneurship process and how women entrepreneurs’ experiences shape and are shaped by their communities. Design/methodology/approach First, five-year 2010-2014 American Community Survey data are analyzed. Then, in-depth interview and focus groups discussion are conducted with 40 women business owners and the data are analyzed using the software package QSR Nvivo. Findings Women entrepreneurs face the challenges and the difficulties of managing both family roles and work. However, they have strategically negotiating with their multiple roles through entrepreneurship to gain independence and purpose, as well as the opportunity to contribute to society. In particular, their embeddedness within local communities provides meanings, opportunities, and functional strategies for their entrepreneurial activities. Research limitations/implications The study is based on only one study area. A larger sample size with more cases from multiple study areas can provide further insights. Practical implications Findings from this study have profound implications for practices of equitable growth, community development, and urban planning under the rapid growth of immigration. Originality/value First, extending focus on the social identity of “motherhood,” this study argues for considering multiple social identities of women entrepreneurs and the intersectionality of multiple identities. Second, it extends the traditional focus of entrepreneurship studies from a singular focus on economic growth to include additional dimensions of work-life balance and sense of community. Third, place is not only a context but also acts powerfully into the entrepreneurial process. It argues that women entrepreneurs and their businesses are deeply embedded in local communities as their multiple identities are shaped at both home and work.",2018,2018-04-03,61,{'Qingfang Wang'},"University of California, Riverside","Migration, Ethnicity, and Economy; Entrepreneurship Studies and Influences; Family Business Performance and Succession",International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behaviour & Research,article,Qingfang Wang,https://openalex.org/A5059837924,American Community Survey; Triangle RDC; Survey of Business Owners; FSRDC,American Community Survey,Triangle
Immigrant underemployment across US metropolitan areas: From a spatial perspective,https://doi.org/10.1177/0042098013506043,"A significant number of immigrants fail to realise their full potential in the US labour markets, as evidenced by those working in occupations requiring skill levels far below their own level of education.

We find a negative relationship between the spatial concentration of African Americans and their business ownership in Miami, but not in Atlanta. In Detroit, a higher percentage of US-born African Americans in the local labor market is actually associated with a higher probability of business ownership. The relationship between the percentage of African Americans and job earnings also differs across the three study areas.

Race/Ethnicity and Employment Insecurity: Impacts of COVID-19 on the US Labor Force and Beyond,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11113-024-09911-5,"Abstract Using the Household Pulse Survey and American Community Survey, this study examines employment insecurity experienced across different racial/ethnic groups of the U.S. labor force under the pandemic disruptions. It highlights significant employment security disparities based on race, ethnicity, and income during the pandemic. However, there are no significant gender and racial disparities within the lowest income group when controlling for other conditions. In contrast, gender and racial disparities in EI are much more pronounced among mid-to-high income groups. Non-White individuals were disproportionately affected by job loss due to health and COVID-related employment issues, unlike Whites who faced unemployment more due to other factors. This pattern was more evident among lower-income groups. The trends shifted in later stages, with high-income Black and Hispanic workers becoming more likely to be unemployed due to non-health and non-employment reasons. Middle-income workers across all races were least likely to stop working for reasons other than COVID-related health or employment issues. In addition, regardless race or ethnicity, women more likely to be unemployed due to health reasons and less so due to employment issues compared to men, and the gender disparities increased with higher household incomes. We propose that the apparent immediate effects of the pandemic are actually indicative of deeper, systemic issues within the U.S. labor market, specifically the occupational segregation tied to race/ethnicity, gender, and class. Recovery efforts must take a holistic approach and integrate economic development policies, workforce development strategies, and social policies targeting poverty alleviation, health disparities, and people of color.",2024,2024-08-01,0,"{'Qingfang Wang', 'Wei Kang'}",,"Employment and Welfare Studies; Regional resilience and development; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies",Population Research and Policy Review,article,Qingfang Wang,https://openalex.org/A5059837924,American Community Survey; Triangle RDC; Survey of Business Owners; FSRDC,American Community Survey,Triangle
Access to Financing and Racial Pay Gap Inside Firms,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4359015,"How does access to financing influence racial pay inequality inside firms? We answer this question using the employer-employee matched data administered by the U.S. Census Bureau and detailed resume data recording workers' career trajectories. Exploiting exogenous shocks to firms' debt capacity, we find that better access to debt financing significantly narrows the earnings gap between minority and white workers. Minority workers experience a persistent increase in earnings and also a rise in the pay rank relative to white workers in the same firm. The effect is more pronounced among mid- and high-skill minority workers, in areas where white workers are in shorter supply, and for firms with ex-ante less diverse boards and greater pre-existing racial inequality. With better access to financing, minority workers are also more likely to be promoted or be reassigned to technology-oriented occupations compared to white workers. Our evidence is consistent with access to financing making firms better utilize minority workers' human capital.",2023,2023-01-01,0,"{'Qiping Xu', 'Janet Gao', 'Wenting Ma'}",Andrew McDonough B+ Foundation; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,Corporate Finance and Governance; Labor market dynamics and wage inequality; Firm Innovation and Growth,SSRN Electronic Journal,article,Qiping Xu,https://openalex.org/A5027553693,LEHD Employer-Level Files (ECF SPF QWI; non-T26); Census Bureau,Census Bureau,UIUC
Housing Affordability and Health: Evidence From New York City,https://doi.org/10.1080/10511482.2015.1020321,"It is generally understood that households make tradeoffs between housing costs and other living expenses. In this article, we examine the relationship between health-related outcomes and housing-induced financial burdens for renters in one of the most expensive cities in the world, New York, New York. Drawing from the Housing Vacancy Survey for 2011, a representative survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau of more than 16,000 households in New York City, we estimate the effect of housing cost burden on the overall health of renters and the extent to which they have postponed various types of medical services for financial reasons. Results show that higher out-of-pocket rent burdens are associated with worse self-reported health conditions and a higher likelihood to postpone medical services for financial reasons. This relationship is particularly strong for those households with severe rent burdens. In addition, housing cost burden is equally or more important than other physical housing characteristics in explaining the variation in self-reported general health status and health care postponement. These findings are robust across specifications with different degrees of household, unit/building, and neighborhood controls, and among longstanding and newer renters. Our findings point to the importance of considering health-related outcomes when designing housing policies, and that housing subsidies should target both renters' out-of-pocket costs and place-based repair and maintenance.",2015,2015-04-27,108,"{'Rachel Meltzer', 'Alex Schwartz'}",New School; New School,Health disparities and outcomes; Global Health Care Issues; Climate Change and Health Impacts,Housing Policy Debate,article,Rachel Meltzer,https://openalex.org/A5020144497,Supplementary Public Data - Price Indices; Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Boston

US Census Response Rates on American Indian Reservations in the 2020 Census and in the 2010 Census,,"Author(s): Ong, Paul; Akee, Randall; Rodriguez-Lonebear, Desi | Abstract: The U.S. Census is the backbone of the U.S. official statistics system. A decennial census is constitutionally mandated to determine proportional representation in Congress. It also provides population counts that are used to allocate public services and funding across the country, and to calculate vital statistics estimates. In the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. Census data are crucial for understanding case and death rates as well. Currently, the U.S. Census Bureau is undertaking its 24th Census amid one of the most difficult enumeration periods in history. While the country faces dual threats of an economic shutdown and the public health pandemic, the decennial census is underway.",2020,2020-05-15,0,"{'Paul Ong', 'Randall Akee', 'Desi Rodriguez-Lonebear'}",,"Census and Population Estimation; Migration, Health and Trauma; HIV, Drug Use, Sexual Risk",,article,Randall K Akee,https://openalex.org/A5024322556,Minnesota RDC; Census Bureau; Census of Services; Census of Manufactures; Census of Retail Trade,Census Bureau,Minnesota
Business Dynamics on American Indian Reservations: Evidence from Longitudinal Datasets,,"We use confidential US Census Bureau data to analyze the difference in business establishment dynamics by geographic location on or off of American Indian reservations over the period of the Great Recession, and subsequent recovery (2007-2016). We geocoded U.S. Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Business Database, a dataset with records of all employer business establishments in the U.S. for location in an American Indian Reservation and used it to examine whether there are differences in business establishment survival rates over time by virtue of their location. We find that business establishments located on American Indian reservations have higher survival rates than establishments located in comparable counties. These results are particularly strong for the education, arts and entertainment, wholesale and retail, and public administration industries. While we are not fully able to explain this result, it is consistent with the business establishments being positively selected with respect to survival given the large obstacles necessary to start a business on a reservation in the first place. Alternatively, there may be certain safeguards in a reservation economy that protect business establishments from external economic shocks.",2020,2020-01-01,0,"{'Randall Akee', 'Elton Mykerezi', 'Richard M.

Immigrants' Earnings Growth and Return Migration from the U.S.: Examining their Determinants using Linked Survey and Administrative Data,,"Using a novel panel data set of recent immigrants to the U.S. (2005-2007) from individual-level linked U.S. Census Bureau survey data and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) administrative records, we identify the determinants of return migration and earnings growth for this immigrant arrival cohort. We show that by 10 years after arrival almost 40 percent have return migrated. Our analysis examines these flows by educational attainment, country of birth, and English language ability separately for each gender. We show, for the first time, that return migrants experience downward earnings mobility over two to three years prior to their return migration. This finding suggests that economic shocks are closely related to emigration decisions; time-variant unobserved characteristics may be more important in determining out-migration than previously known. We also show that wage assimilation with native-born populations occurs fairly quickly; after 10 years there is strong convergence in earnings by several characteristics. Finally, we confirm that the use of stock-based panel data lead to estimates of slower earnings growth than is found using repeated cross-section data. However, we also show, using selection-correction methods in our panel data, that stock-based panel data may understate the rate of earnings growth for the initial immigrant arrival cohort when emigration is not accounted for.",2019,2019-03-01,0,"{'Randall Akee', 'Maggie R.

Segregation and neighborhood change in northern cities: New historical GIS data from 1900–1930,https://doi.org/10.1080/01615440.2016.1151393,"Most quantitative research on segregation and neighborhood change in American cities prior to 1940 has utilized data published by the Census Bureau at the ward level.

This article reports the creation of a mapped public use dataset for EDs in ten northern cities for each decade from 1900 to 1930.

Larger establishments are also found to recirculate water more – satisfying demand (water use) without necessarily increasing water intake. Various costs also appear to play a role in water recirculation. In particular, the water circulation rate is found to be higher when water is purchased from a utility. Relatively low (internal) prices for self-supplied water could suppress the incentive to invest in recirculation. Meanwhile, establishments with higher per-gallon intake treatment costs also recirculate more, as might be expected. The cost associated with water discharge – due to regulation or otherwise – also increases circulation rates. The aridity of a locale is found to have little effect on circulation rates.",2016,2016-01-01,1,{'Randy A.

Newly Recovered Microdata on U.S. Manufacturing Plants from the 1950s and 1960s: Some Early Glimpses,,"Longitudinally-linked microdata on U.S. manufacturing plants are currently available to researchers for 1963, 1967, and 1972-2009. In this paper, we provide a first look at recently recovered manufacturing microdata files from the 1950s and 1960s. We describe their origins and background, discuss their contents, and begin to explore their sample coverage. We also begin to examine whether the available establishment identifier(s) allow record linking. Our preliminary analyses suggest that longitudinally-linked Annual Survey of Manufactures microdata from the mid-1950s through the present – containing 16 years of additional data – appears possible though challenging. While a great deal of work remains, we see tremendous value in extending the manufacturing microdata series back into time. With these data, new lines of research become possible and many others can be revisited.",2011,2011-09-01,0,"{'Randy A.

Do Environmental Regulations Disproportionately Affect Small Businesses? Evidence from the Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures Survey,,"It remains an open question whether the impact of environmental regulations differs by the size of the business. Such differences might be expected because of statutory, enforcement, and/or compliance asymmetries.

Pollution Abatement Expenditure by U.S. Manufacturing Plants: Do Community Characteristics Matter?,https://doi.org/10.2202/1538-0645.1231,"Abstract This paper examines whether community characteristics impact the air pollution abatement (APA) activity at nearby manufacturing plants, using establishment-level data from the U.S. Census Bureaus Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures (PACE) survey. Controlling for facility characteristics and various forms of formal environmental regulation, certain community characteristics are found to have additional effects on local APA expenditures. In particular, for the most pollution-intensive industries, larger per capita income is found to increase plant-level APA activity, as is a higher degree of homeownership, a greater concentration of Democratic voters, and being located in a metropolitan area. Meanwhile, a greater presence of manufacturing employees is found to decrease APA expenditures, suggesting a constituency that is more resistant to additional regulation. If local populations can indeed affect pollution abatement activity, they can impact the spatial distribution of pollution, thereby creating pollution haven effects.",2003,2003-12-31,40,{'Randy A.

Costs of Air Quality Regulation,https://doi.org/10.3386/w7308,"This paper explores some costs associated with environmental regulation.We focus on regulation pertaining to ground-level ozone (O 3 ) and its effects on two manufacturing industries --industrial organic chemicals (SIC 2865-9) and miscellaneous plastic products (SIC 308).Both are major emitters of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (No x ), the chemical precursors to ozone.Using plant-level data from the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Research Database (LRD), we examine the effects of regulation on the timing and magnitudes of investments by firms and on the impact it has had on their operating costs.As an alternative way to assess costs, we also employ plant-level data from the Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures (PACE) survey.Analyses employing average total cost functions reveal that plants' production costs are indeed higher in (heavily-regulated) non-attainment areas relative to (less-regulated) attainment areas.This is particularly true for younger plants, consistent with the notion that regulation is most burdensome for new (rather than existing) plants.Cost estimates using PACE data generally reveal lower costs.We also find that new heavily-regulated plants start our much larger than less-regulated plants, but then do not invest as much.Among other things, this highlights the substantial fixed costs involved in obtaining expansion permits.We also discuss reasons why plants may restrict their size.",1999,1999-08-01,44,"{'J.

“New White Ethnics” or “New Latinos”? Hispanic/Latino Pan-ethnicity and Ancestry Reporting among South American Immigrants to the United States,https://doi.org/10.1177/0197918321993100,"This article explores the identification patterns of South American immigrants to the United States, as measured via Hispanic/Latino ethnicity and ancestry reporting on the US Census. Using data from the 2006–2010 and 2011–2015 American Community Survey, my analysis reveals four main findings. First, I show significant heterogeneity in identity patterns and in sociodemographic, immigration, and geographic characteristics between South American and Mexican immigrants in the United States. Second, I find that Southern Cone immigrants opt not to report Hispanic/Latino ethnicity and “birth-country” ancestry (ancestry that is concordant with birth country, such as Colombian or Chilean) to a greater extent than Andean immigrants and, instead, report more distal “ancestral-origin” ancestries (i.e., Spanish, Japanese, etc.). Third, I show that those immigrants who do report Hispanic/Latino ethnicity are more likely to report “birth-country” ancestry than “ancestral-origin” ancestry, net of other factors. Finally, my analysis demonstrates that Brazilian immigrants chart a different path of identification among South American immigrants and almost unanimously do not report Hispanic/Latino ethnicity while overwhelmingly reporting “Brazilian” ancestry. Taken together, variation in Hispanic/Latino ethnicity and ancestry reporting across South American immigrant groups has implications for their incorporation into US society, as well as for the degree to which these immigrants see themselves as racialized actors in the United States. Some South American immigrant groups (Southern Cone immigrants) appear to be incorporating as “New White ethnics,” and others (Andean immigrants) appear to be incorporating as “New Latinos.” Researchers of international migration should carefully consider these identification differences and their implications for the measurement and study of “Hispanic/Latino” immigrants and their descendants in the United States.",2021,2021-03-09,11,{'Rebecca Anna Schut'},University of Pennsylvania,"Racial and Ethnic Identity Research; Migration and Labor Dynamics; Migration, Health and Trauma",International Migration Review,article,Rebecca A Schut,https://openalex.org/A5078350044,Philadelphia RDC; American Community Survey; BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),American Community Survey,Philadelphia
The Painful and Chilling Effects of Legal Violence: Immigration Enforcement and Racialized Legal Status Inequities in Worker Well-Being,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11113-024-09862-x,"A wave of restrictive immigration policies implemented over the past several decades dramatically increased immigrant detentions and deportations in the United States (U.S.), with important consequences for a host of immigrant outcomes. Still, questions remain as to how temporal and geographic variation in immigration enforcement within and across the U.S. shaped racialized legal status inequities in health and well-being, particularly among those employed in precarious occupations. To fill this gap, we interrogated the links between changes in county-level immigration enforcement and racialized legal status inequalities in musculoskeletal pain and social welfare benefits utilization among U.S. agricultural workers over nearly two decades (2002–2018). We merged data from three sources [(1) restricted-access, geocoded data from the National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS) (n = 37,619); (2) county-level immigration enforcement data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC); and (3) population data from the Census and American Community Survey (ACS)] and estimated linear probability models with year, month, and state fixed effects. We show that, in counties with high enforcement rates, workers—especially undocumented workers—were at increased risk of musculoskeletal pain, including pain that was severe. Heightened enforcement was also associated with declines in needs-based benefits utilization, especially among documented and U.S.-citizen non-White workers and undocumented White and non-White workers. Together, these findings highlight how changes in sociopolitical and legal contexts can shift and maintain racialized legal status hierarchies, with especially important consequences for the well-being of vulnerable workers.",2024,2024-03-13,0,"{'Courtney Boen', 'Rebecca Anna Schut', 'Nicholas Graetz'}",University of Pennsylvania; University of Chicago; Princeton University,"Employment and Welfare Studies; Migration, Health and Trauma; Racial and Ethnic Identity Research",Population Research and Policy Review,article,Rebecca A Schut,https://openalex.org/A5078350044,Philadelphia RDC; American Community Survey; BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),American Community Survey,Philadelphia

Additional data sources include Infogroup USA Business Data, the American Community Survey, and an Environmental Protection Agency traffic activity indicator. Multilevel negative binomial regression models are estimated to observe the main and interactive effects of census block group and business variables on crime at the parcel. Results: Businesses located in block groups with more commercial property and high levels of vehicular traffic experience more crime. In addition, crime is higher at “busy” businesses, as indicated by employee size, sales volume, and square footage. Busy contexts and busy businesses do not appear to interact to increase crime at the parcel beyond their main effects. Conclusions: Crime is clustered at relatively few businesses, and this variation cannot be explained by business type alone.

Toward a Cross-Platform Framework: Assessing the Comprehensiveness of Online Rental Listings.,,"Research on rental housing markets in the United States has traditionally relied on national or local housing surveys. Those sources lack temporal and spatial specificity, limiting their use for tracking short-term changes in local markets. As rental housing ads have transitioned to digital spaces, a growing body of literature has utilized web scraping to analyze listing practices and variations in rental market dynamics. Those studies have primarily relied on one platform, Craigslist, as a source of data. Despite Craigslist's popularity, the authors contend that rental listings from various websites, rather than from individual ones, provide a more comprehensive picture. Using a mixed-methods approach to study listings across various platforms in five metropolitan areas, this article demonstrates considerable variation in both the types of rental units advertised and the features provided across those platforms. The article begins with an account of the birth and consolidation of online rental platforms and emergent characteristics of several selected websites, including the criteria for posting, search parameters, search results priority, and first-page search results. Visualizations are used to compare features such as the 40th percentile of rent, rent distribution, and bedroom size based on scraped data from six online platforms (Padmapper, Forrent.com, Trulia, Zillow, Craigslist, and GoSection8), 2020 Fair Market Rents, and 2019 American Community Survey data. The analyses indicate that online listing platforms target different audiences and offer distinct information on units within those market segments, resulting in markedly different estimates of local rental costs and unit size distribution depending on the platform.",2021,2021-01-01,4,"{'Arthur Acolin', 'Rebecca J.

COVID-19–Related Stressors and Mental Health Disorders Among US Adults,https://doi.org/10.1177/00333549221120451,"Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to severe mental health repercussions. We examined rates of anxiety and depression in the United States during the pandemic by demographic characteristics, individual stressors, and COVID-19 infection rates and policy contexts. Methods: We merged data from the April 2020–March 2021 US Household Pulse Survey with state-level data on COVID-19 rates and mitigation policies, including stay-at-home orders, face mask mandates, and restaurant closures. We estimated weighted logistic regression models to assess correlates of anxiety and depression. Results: Rates of anxiety and depression peaked in late 2020 at 39% and 32%, respectively. Food insecurity and disrupted medical care were associated with more than twice the odds of anxiety and depression (food insecurity: odds ratio [OR] = 2.58 for anxiety and 2.61 for depression; disrupted medical care: OR = 2.40 and 2.27). Being not employed (OR = 1.32 for anxiety and 1.45 for depression), uninsured (OR = 1.30 and 1.38), housing insecure (OR = 1.41 and 1.34), and experiencing disruptions in education (OR = 1.28 and 1.25) were linked to 25% to 45% increased odds of anxiety and depression. Increases in state COVID-19 infection rates were associated with significantly heightened odds of anxiety and depression (OR = 1.01 for anxiety and depression), but state mitigation policies were not.

The purpose of this study was to track trends in mental health symptoms, use of services, and unmet need for services among US adults, and to delineate variation across demographic strata. Data were drawn from the 2020 US Household Pulse Survey from repeated cross-sectional online surveys collected between April 23 and November 23, 2020 from 1,302,455 US adults, weighted to represent the US population. Survey respondents self-reported their symptoms of anxiety and depression, use of medication and counseling services, and unmet need for services. Reports of probable anxiety and depression rose significantly through the study period, to prevalence rates of 37% and 29%, respectively, by November, 2020, rates more than four times higher than early 2019 US norms. Use of prescription medication, counseling services, and unmet need for mental health services also rose significantly. Prevalence rates of probable mental health disorders were highest among young, less educated, single parent, female, Black and multi-racial respondents, with some vacillation in such disparities over cohorts. Young, female, and moderately educated respondents also reported higher unmet needs for services. Disparities in estimates of mental health disorders and mental health treatment indicate a striking disequilibrium between the potential need for and the use of mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising mental health challenges are being borne largely by young, less advantaged people of color and women, with the potential for expanded interruptions to optimal functioning and societal recovery from COVID-19.The myriad stressors imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic have impaired mental health and wellbeing. Although evidence from early in the pandemic revealed elevated rates of mental health conditions, research has not documented whether psychological disorders have continued to rise as the pandemic has persisted. In this research, we assess data from over 1.3 million US adults who participated in cross-sectional surveys between April and November, 2020 to track trends in mental health disorder symptoms and services. Our results show that reports of anxiety and depression rose significantly from April to November, 2020 to rates more than four-times higher than in 2019.

To what extent is this relationship gendered? The findings suggest that military service is associated with higher odds of completing a STEM degree and that this association is particularly strong for female veterans. Comparison across multiple STEM definitions suggests that military service does not simply channel women into traditionally female-dominated STEM fields. Instead, the findings show the biggest boost for women earning degrees in traditionally male-dominated STEM fields.

While research demonstrates this pattern for women veterans, we know little about racialized and intersectional patterns. This article uses the American Community Survey data (2014–2018) to examine the association between military service, race/ethnicity, and gender to STEM degrees earned. We find that military service operates contingently: White men’s plus white, Hispanic, and multiracial/other women’s predicted probability of earning a STEM degree increases with military service. In contrast, for other minority groups, military service is not associated with a higher predicted probability of earning a STEM degree. Indeed, for groups typically overrepresented in STEM fields (i.e., Asian veterans), a negative association exists.

The Linkage between Immigration and Internal Migration in Large Metropolitan Areas in the United States*,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1944-8287.1997.tb00069.x,"""This paper investigates the relationship between the internal migration of native-born workers and flows of immigrants to the United States using the 1980 and 1990 U.S. Census Bureau microsamples.... Based on the estimation of three sets of regression models for five overlapping samples of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States and five mutually exclusive segments of the labor force, this analysis shows that the finding of a significant linkage between internal migration and immigration depends critically on the empirical experiment used. In direct opposition to previous published research, we conclude that net migration of the native born for metropolitan areas is either positively related or unrelated to immigration. Our models show that the net migration loss of unskilled native workers from metropolitan areas is probably a function of those cities' population size rather than immigrant flow to them. We conclude that the net migration loss of native-born workers from large metropolitan areas is more likely the result of industrial restructuring than of competition with immigrants.""",1997,1997-04-01,156,"{'Richard Wright', 'Mark Ellis', 'Michael Reibel'}","Dartmouth College; University of California, Los Angeles; University of California, Los Angeles","Migration and Labor Dynamics; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Regional Economics and Spatial Analysis",Economic Geography,article,Richard A Wright,https://openalex.org/A5080215478,Decennial Census; FSRDC; UCLA RDC; Census Bureau,Census Bureau,UCLA
"Place, scale and the racial claims made for multiracial children in the 1990 US Census",https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870802021120,"Abstract Abstract Multiracial children embody ambiguities inherent in racial categorization and expose fictions of discrete races. Nevertheless, parents of multiracial children were asked for the 1990 US Census to report a single race for their offspring. Using confidential 1990 Census micro-data, we investigate the choices parents made for the three most common racially mixed household types (Asian-white, black-white and Latino-white) in twelve large metropolitan areas. We find that context affects the reporting of children's racial identity. We examine these effects with models that incorporate three spatial scales: households, neighbourhoods and metropolitan areas. Model estimates reveal that racial claims made by parents of Latino- and Asian-white (but not black-white) children varied significantly across metropolitan area. A neighbourhood's proportion white increased the probability that parents reported their children as white, while a neighbourhood's racial diversity increased the probability that black-white parents claimed a non-white race (black or ‘other’) for their children.

This paper reports the results of research and analysis undertaken while the authors were conducting a study approved by the Center for Economic Studies at the US Census Bureau. It has undergone a Census Bureau review more limited in scope than that given to official Census Bureau publications. Research results and conclusions expressed are those of the authors and do not necessarily indicate concurrence by the Census Bureau. It has been screened to ensure that no confidential information is revealed. Notes 1. This layering will always be imperfect because, as Goldberg observes, the census form ‘lags behind the complex negotiations of identities and (self-) identifications in everyday experience, even as it serves in part to shape and fix those identities and identifications’ (1997, pp. 32–3). 2. Most US research that measures contextual effects on parents’ racial claims for their children has relied on large geographic units (Public Use Microsample Areas) containing a minimum population of 100,000. Our analysis is the first to use considerably smaller census tracts that contain between 4,000 and 8,000 people, because the Census Bureau provided us with access to confidential information on individuals in households by census tract of residence for the 1990 Census. While considerable debate remains in the social science literature about the most appropriate scale of neighbourhood cartography (e.g. Martin 2003 Martin, D. G. 2003. ‘Enacting neighborhood’. Urban Geography, 24(5): 361–85. [Taylor & Francis Online], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]), and we could have used smaller block groups, census tracts are most suitable for two reasons. One, our broader project engages the existing racial residential segregation literature – a literature that predominantly uses census tracts. Two, despite having access to the full one-in-six sample of long-form respondents, our sample sizes remain small. Census tracts seem to us an appropriate compromise between the detail that a smaller geographic unit might provide and the precedent of previous literature and our data demands. 3. We follow demographic convention in treating all respondents that indicate Latino or Hispanic ancestry as a distinct racial category, regardless of their response to the race question. In so doing we do not assume away the multiple identities subsumed with this meta-category (e.g. those based on national origin, nativity, class and political ideology, among many others). Moreover, we explicitly reject the notion that the terms ‘Latino’ or ‘Hispanic’ mark a meaningful category of ethnic identity. Rather, we see the creation of pan-ethnic Latino/Hispanic identity in the US as a process of racial formation. Also, noting ongoing terminological debates, we use the terms Latino and Hispanic interchangeably. 4. Our larger project includes racial mixing between non-white adults. Because the children from these and other mixed-race pairings were numerically infrequent, we cannot publish such data as we would risk disclosure of information deemed confidential by Census Bureau. 5. Even when women retain the names with which they were born, children still most often carry their father's family name. 6. We assume that parents fill out the census questionnaire in households with young children. 7. We identify mixed-race households as those where the race of the adult male and adult female (where the relationship to the household head is reported as married or partner) differ across the standard race categories used in the 1990 Census (white, black, Asian, Indian, other). We treat all respondents who indicate Latino or Hispanic ancestry as a distinct racial category, regardless of their response to the race question (see note 3 for additional discussion). 8. We configured the sample to mitigate endogeneity between residential location decisions and parents’ views of their children's racial identity. The age restriction improves our assumptions that parents fill out the census form. It also reduces the chance that parents may declare racial identity as children see themselves, which is more likely in older children and reflects non-residential settings. We initially restricted the sample to households that did not move between 1985 and 1990 to eliminate recent residential moves made with children in mind. This restriction, however, removed over two-thirds of the sample. We kept recent movers in the sample and controlled for their residential mobility with a variable in the models. 9. The standard entropy diversity measure for each tract is , where k indexes racial groups, j indexes census tracts and t indexes total tract population. The maximum value of Ej is obtained when tract j's population is evenly divided between the k racial groups. Since the number of racial groups limits the magnitude of the maximum value, we include a scaling constant s so that Ej ranges between 0 and 1. We calculated Ej based on individuals in the six standard racial groups (Latino, white, black, Asian, Native American and other).",2008,2008-07-12,28,"{'Richard Wright', 'Steven R.

The Rise of Mixed Parentage: A Sociological and Demographic Phenomenon to Be Reckoned With,https://doi.org/10.1177/0002716218757656,"Ethno-racially mixed parentage is rising in frequency, creating a strong challenge to both census classification schemes and, indeed, to common conceptions of ethnicity and race. Majority (white) and minority (nonwhite or Hispanic) parentage predominates among individuals with mixed-family backgrounds. Yet in public presentations of census data and population projections, individuals with mixed backgrounds are generally classified as nonwhite. We analyze 2013 American Community Survey data and summarize the results of important studies to argue that individuals from mixed majority-minority backgrounds resemble whites more than they do minorities in terms of some key social characteristics and experiences, such as where they grow up and their social affiliations as adults. Those with a black parent are an important exception. An implication of this analysis is that census classification practices for mixed individuals risk distorting conceptions of the current population, especially its youthful portion, and promoting misunderstandings of ethno-racial change.",2018,2018-04-25,49,"{'Duygu Başaran Şahin', 'Brenden Beck', 'Richard Alba'}",,"Racial and Ethnic Identity Research; Family Dynamics and Relationships; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies",The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,article,Richard D Alba,https://openalex.org/A5014686784,Census Household Composition Key File; American Community Survey; BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),American Community Survey,Cornell
The New Second Generation in the United States,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-7379.2002.tb00100.x,"Immigration to the United States accelerated in the late 1960s. Since many migrants are young people who form families shortly after arrival, there is now a large and rapidly growing second generation - many of them now young adults who recently completed school and started their careers. There is much speculation about whether this second generation will assimilate into the middle class rapidly or form a new urban underclass. The last census to ask parental birthplace questions was 1970, so an absence of data precluded testing hypotheses about the social and economic progress of the new second generation. In 1994, the Census Bureau returned an inquiry about parental birthplace to the Current Population Survey so there is now an annual national sample of about 16,000 second-generation Americans. Data from the 1998 and 2000 surveys were pooled and analyzed. This investigation demonstrates that these comprehensive new data provide valuable descriptive information about today's second generation and permit the cautious testing of hypotheses concerning social and economic assimilation. They reveal a great diversity among the second generation depending upon country of origin but, in most comparisons, today's second generation exceed their first-generation parents in educational attainment, occupational achievement and economic status. In many comparisons, second-generation groups have educational attainments exceeding those of third- and higher-generation whites and African Americans. These data refute the hypothesis that today's second generation will languish in poverty. Nevertheless, intergenerational progress was less for persons of Puerto Rican and Mexican heritage than for those of Asian, European or South American heritage.",2002,2002-09-01,270,"{'Reynolds Farley', 'Richard Alba'}","University of Michigan–Ann Arbor; University at Albany, State University of New York; Albany State University","Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Migration and Labor Dynamics; Migration, Ethnicity, and Economy",International Migration Review,article,Richard D Alba,https://openalex.org/A5014686784,FSRDC; Cornell RDC; Decennial Census; Baruch RDC; Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Cornell
What Majority-minority Society? A Critical Analysis of the Census Bureau’s Projections of America’s Demographic Future,https://doi.org/10.1177/2378023118796932,"On the basis of demographic projections by the U.S. Census Bureau, many Americans believe that their society will transition soon to a majority-minority one. The author analyzes the latest version of the projections and finds that the pivotal group is made up of individuals who come from mixed minority-white family backgrounds. It is projected to grow very rapidly in coming decades, and Census Bureau classification practices mean that most of its members are counted as minority. Without this classification, however, the emergence of a majority-minority society by 2060 is far from certain. Moreover, the evidence we possess about the characteristics, social affiliations, and identities of mixed individuals contradicts this Census Bureau practice, except for partly black individuals, who suffer from high levels of racism. Taking into account the ambiguous social locations of most mixed minority-white persons, the author suggests that, even should a majority-minority society appear, it will not look like we presently imagine it.",2018,2018-01-01,72,{'Richard Alba'},"The Graduate Center, CUNY","Migration and Labor Dynamics; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Migration, Refugees, and Integration",Socius Sociological Research for a Dynamic World,article,Richard D Alba,https://openalex.org/A5014686784,FSRDC; Cornell RDC; Decennial Census; Baruch RDC; Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Cornell

Gaining Steam: Incumbent Lock-In and Entrant Leapfrogging,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4810599,"We examine the long transition from water to steam power in US manufacturing, focusing on early users of mechanical power: lumber and flour mills. Digitizing Census of Manufactures manuscripts for 1850 to 1880, we show that as steam costs declined, manufacturing activity grew faster in counties with less waterpower potential. This growth was driven by steam powered entrants and agglomeration, as water powered incumbents faced switching barriers primarily from sunk costs. Estimating a dynamic model of firm entry and steam adoption, we find that the interaction of switching barriers and high fixed costs creates a quantitatively important and socially inefficient drag on technology adoption. Despite substantial entry and exit, switching barriers remained influential for aggregate steam adoption throughout the 19th century, as water power required lower fixed costs and therefore was attractive to relatively low productivity entrants. These entrants then became incumbents, locked into water power even if their productivity grew.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",2024,2024-01-01,0,"{'Richard Hornbeck', 'Martin Rotemberg', 'Shanon Hsuan-Ming Hsu', 'Anders Humlum'}",University of Chicago; University of Chicago; University of Chicago; New York University,Electric Power System Optimization; Global trade and economics; Power System Reliability and Maintenance,SSRN Electronic Journal,article,Richard Hornbeck,https://openalex.org/A5026266432,Census of Manufactures; Annual Survey of Manufactures; FSRDC; Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,Census of Manufactures,Boston
Business Dynamics on American Indian Reservations: Evidence from Longitudinal Datasets,,"We use confidential US Census Bureau data to analyze the difference in business establishment dynamics by geographic location on or off of American Indian reservations over the period of the Great Recession, and subsequent recovery (2007-2016). We geocoded U.S. Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Business Database, a dataset with records of all employer business establishments in the U.S. for location in an American Indian Reservation and used it to examine whether there are differences in business establishment survival rates over time by virtue of their location. We find that business establishments located on American Indian reservations have higher survival rates than establishments located in comparable counties. These results are particularly strong for the education, arts and entertainment, wholesale and retail, and public administration industries. While we are not fully able to explain this result, it is consistent with the business establishments being positively selected with respect to survival given the large obstacles necessary to start a business on a reservation in the first place. Alternatively, there may be certain safeguards in a reservation economy that protect business establishments from external economic shocks.",2020,2020-01-01,0,"{'Randall Akee', 'Elton Mykerezi', 'Richard M.

Structural versus ethnic dimensions of housing segregation,https://doi.org/10.1080/07352166.2017.1360730,"Racial residential segregation is still very high in many American cities. Some portion of segregation is attributable to socioeconomic differences across racial lines (what we call structural factors); some portion is caused by purely racial factors, such as housing market discrimination and preferences for the race of one's neighbors. Past attempts to measure the structural component of segregation have generally focused on only 1 socioeconomic status (SES) variable and have produced results that are high in potential measurement error. In this article, we use an innovative method and uniquely suitable data (geocoded microdata obtained through the U.S. Census Bureau's Research Data Center [RDC] program) to disaggregate segregation into a ""structural"" and a residual component. Our measure shows the amount of segregation that would remain if we could randomly assign households to housing units based only on nonracial socioeconomic characteristics.

Distance to an Abortion Provider and Its Association with the Abortion Rate: A Multistate Longitudinal Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1363/psrh.12164,"CONTEXT Although one in four U.S. women has an abortion in her lifetime, barriers to abortion persist, including distance to care. This study evaluates the association between distance to care and the abortion rate, adjusting for abortion demand. METHODS Two analyses were conducted using a data set linking provider locations and 2000–2014 county‐level abortion data for 18 states; data sources included the Census Bureau, state vital statistics offices and the Guttmacher Institute. First, a series of linear regression models were run, with and without adjustment for demographic covariates, modeling distance as both a continuous and a categorical variable. Then, an instrumental variable analysis was conducted in which being 30 or more miles from a large college‐enrolled female population younger than age 25 was used as an instrument for distance to a provider. The outcome variable for all models was abortions per 1,000 women aged 25 or older. All models were adjusted for state, year and state‐year interaction fixed effects. RESULTS Increased distance to a provider was associated with a decreased abortion rate. Each additional mile to a provider was associated with a decrease of 0.011 in the abortion rate. Compared with being within 30 miles of a provider, being between 30 and 90 miles from a provider was associated with 0.80–1.46 fewer abortions per 1,000 women. In the instrumental variable analysis, being 30 or more miles from a provider was associated with 5.26 fewer abortions per 1,000 women. CONCLUSIONS Distance to a provider may present a barrier to abortion by preventing access to care. Therefore, policies that increase travel distances have potential for harm.",2020,2020-12-01,26,"{'Benjamin P. Brown', 'Luciana E.

Regional trade and “the medicine line”: The national border effect in U.S. commodity flow data,https://doi.org/10.1080/08865655.1998.9695516,"Abstract The role of national borders in the international economy has been a topic of widespread public discussion in recent years. The conventional wisdom on the topic is that in an increasingly integrated global economy with relatively low formal trade barriers, national borders are no longer important inhibitors of trade. McCallum (1995) cast some doubt on this belief when he found that, after adjusting for economic size and geographic distance, trade among Canadian provinces was more than twenty times greater than trade between those same provinces and U.S. states. The 1993 Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to verify these surprising results, as well as to investigate subsequent questions, such as why the border matters, and how it affects economic welfare. This paper reviews the existing literature on the geography of trade flows, describes the CFS, and attempts to verify the McCallum result at the aggregate level. Despite a number of a priori reasons to believe otherwise, the author finds that CFS estimates of the “border effect” are almost exactly equivalent to those estimated by McCallum.",1998,1998-09-01,33,{'Russell Hillberry'},Indiana University,Global trade and economics; Fiscal Policy and Economic Growth; Regional Economics and Spatial Analysis,Journal of Borderlands Studies,article,Russell Hillberry,https://openalex.org/A5063069804,Census of Manufactures; Washington RDC; FSRDC; Commodity Flow Survey; Census of Mining; Census Bureau,Commodity Flow Survey,Washington

Bayesian Methods Applied to Small Area Estimation for Establishment Statistics,https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119672333.ch30,"Establishment survey data is frequently used to estimate population level characteristics of organizations rather than individuals. For large domains of interest, direct survey estimates may fare well; however, when interest lies in domains that contain relatively few samples, direct survey estimates are inefficient, leading to the need for small area models. These models rely on various dependencies within the data in order to ""borrow information,"" leading to more precise estimates. Dependencies may include covariates, spatial dependence, temporal dependence, multivariate relationships, or in the case of establishment surveys specifically, dependence on industry classification. Bayesian hierarchical modeling provides a natural foundation for modeling sources of dependence, and thus also a natural framework for small area estimation of establishment statistics. Within this Bayesian framework, there are two separate overarching modeling approaches. The first approach is to use area-level models, which treat the direct survey estimates as the response, and then ""smooth"" these estimates through the modeling hierarchy. In contrast, unit-level models, which do not consider the direct estimates, instead, model the sampled units directly. There are positive and negative trade-offs under both approaches and, in this work, we give an overview of various Bayesian methods that fall under both categories.

Bayesian Hierarchical Models For Multi-type Survey Data Using Spatially Correlated Covariates Measured With Error,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2211.09797,"We introduce Bayesian hierarchical models for predicting high-dimensional tabular survey data which can be distributed from one or multiple classes of distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Poisson, Binomial, etc.). We adopt a Bayesian implementation of a Hierarchical Generalized Transformation (HGT) model to deal with the non-conjugacy of non-Gaussian data models when estimated using a Latent Gaussian Process (LGP) model. Survey data are usually prone to a high degree of sampling error, and we use covariates that are prone to measurement error as well as those free of any such error. A classical measurement error component is defined to deal with the sampling error in the covariates. The proposed models can be high-dimensional and we employ the notion of basis function expansions to provide an effective approach to dimension reduction. The HGT component lends flexibility to our model to incorporate multi-type response datasets under a unified latent process model framework. To demonstrate the applicability of our methodology, we provide the results from simulation studies and data applications arising from a dataset consisting of the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year period estimates of the total population count under the poverty threshold and the ACS 5-year period estimates of median housing costs at the county level across multiple states in the USA.",2022,2022-01-01,2,"{'Saikat Nandy', 'Scott H.

Bayesian and machine learning models for dependent data with applications to official statistics and survey methodology,https://doi.org/10.32469/10355/97065,"[EMBARGOED UNTIL 8/1/2024] Small Area estimation has garnered much interest in recent times by both private entities as well government agencies as means of public policy guidance, formulating programs for regional and national planning, allocating government funds, and advocating investments. Small-area models are comprised of area-level models that relate direct estimators to area-specific covariates, and the alternative unit-level models that directly model survey responses. Both types of models have their advantages and their unique sets of challenges. In this dissertation, we address some of these challenges. Modern complex surveys collect and report data on a variety of topics, and often the response types are not continuous numeric responses but can be categorical, count-valued, or completely non-numeric like text and functional responses. Here we concentrate on multiple types of numeric responses. First, we extend the measurement error modeling paradigm to areal non-Gaussian data, that can be distributed from one or multiple classes of distributions (e.g. Gaussian, Poisson, Binomial etc.), when the covariates are measured with error and spatially correlated. Survey responses are prone to measurement error which can result from a host of different sources and failing to address this error can lead to a biased and erroneous inference. Second, traditional areal-level models tend to model spatial dependence structures based on the nearest-neighbor approach. These models assume that geographically connected areal units exhibit strong correlations and that the strength of this connection grows weaker as we move farther away. We propose a new neighborhood network where the probability of connection between two areal units is determined by not just their geographical proximity, but also their socio-demographic similarity. We embed this in a traditional spatial model, e.g., Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) model. Third, we address the issue of computational efficiency while working with data from complex surveys which can include millions of individuals. We introduce Bayesian data sketching algorithms to compress high-dimensional survey data at both the area level and the unit level onto a lower-dimension subspace using random projection matrices. This framework relies on the Bayesian pseudo-likelihood to accommodate the survey design, as well as the Bayesian hierarchical framework to model various dependence structures. We motivate the applications of our proposed frameworks with applications to public use data from American Community Survey (ACS).",2023,2023-08-01,0,{'Saikat Nandy'},,Spatial and Panel Data Analysis; Human Mobility and Location-Based Analysis; demographic modeling and climate adaptation,,dissertation,Saikat Nandy,https://openalex.org/A5103528375,American Community Survey; Missouri RDC; Master Address File Extract; FSRDC; Census Bureau,American Community Survey,Missouri
Obesity among black women in food deserts: An “omnibus” test of differential risk,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2019.100363,"The ""omnibus"" hypothesis, as forwarded by Ford and Dzewaltowski (2008), asserts that poor-quality food environments differentially affect low- and high-socioeconomic status (SES) populations. Accordingly, we examine, in a large sample of non-Hispanic (NH) black women, whether low access to healthy food corresponds with increased risk of obesity among residents of low- and high-poverty neighborhoods. In addition, we analyze whether any discovered association between low-food access and obesity appears stronger in neighborhoods with a high proportion of black residents. We retrieved body mass index (BMI) data for 97,366 NH black women residing in 6258 neighborhoods from the California Department of Public Health birth files for years 2007-2010. We linked BMI data with census tract-level data on neighborhood food access from the 2010 Food Access Research Atlas and neighborhood poverty and black composition from the 2006-2010 American Community Survey 5-year estimates. We applied generalized estimating equation methods that permit analysis of clustered data within neighborhoods. Methods also controlled for individual-level characteristics which might confound the relation between food access and obesity, including health insurance status, age, education, and parity. Results indicate that low-food access does not impact risk of obesity among NH black women residing in low-poverty neighborhoods. However, low-food access varies positively with risk of obesity in high-poverty neighborhoods. Moreover, the association between low-food access and obesity appears stronger in high-poverty, high-black composition neighborhoods, relative to high-poverty, low-black composition neighborhoods. Our findings support the omnibus hypothesis and indicate a potential interaction between factors in the local food and social environments on an individual's risk of obesity.",2019,2019-02-25,16,"{'Tim A.

Researchers often run into knotty data problems involving data interpretation or manipulation that must be solved before a project can proceed, but they seldom get to focus in detail on the solutions to such problems. If you have an idea for an applied, data-centric note of no more than 3,000 words, please send a one-paragraph abstract to david.a.vandenbroucke@hud.gov for consideration.IntroductionAs the most comprehensive source of data on the U.S. stock, the American Housing Survey (AHS) is relied on by policymakers, practitioners, and researchers seeking answers to questions about the conditions, costs, and myriad other attributes of the nation's housing. For those developing their own surveys, the AHS is also a source of questions. Some of the most prominent social science studies of the past two decades, including the Moving to Opportunity for Fair Housing Demonstration (Shroder, 2001), Welfare, Children, & Families, A Three-City Study (Winston et al., 1999), and the Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study (Reichman et al., 2001), include questions that are strikingly similar if not identical to the AHS items on characteristics and conditions.Of particular interest to many users is the AHS composite measure of inadequacy available on the public use database. This measure combines 15 individual questionnaire items on conditions into an index, setting numerical thresholds for the presence or absence of physical deficiencies in the dwelling to distinguish among adequate, moderately inadequate, and severely inadequate units. Both the AHS and data users refer to this composite as AHS's housing quality measure.1 Numerous published articles include the AHS measure in their analyses (for example, Carter, 2011; Friedman and Rosenbaum, 2004; Khadduri, 2007; Ross, Shlay, and Picon, 2012), the measure plays a prominent role in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Worst Case Needs reports (for example, HUD, 201 lb), and it is also included in the frequently cited Joint Center for Housing Studies' State ojthe Nauon's Housing reports (for example, JCHS, 2010) and by the Millenial Housing Commission (2002).Despite widespread reliance on the AHS inadequacy index by a broad audience of users, little is known about its reliability, internal consistency, and validity. These attributes are typically referred to as psychometric features, because these tests were originally developed to assess indicators within the purview of psychologists, such as cognitive achievement, attitudes, and personality (Nunnaly, 1978).Our goal in this article is to shed light on each of these psychometric properties of the AHS inadequacy index. This information will enable users to assess, for example, (1) if the inadequacy index differentiates among dwellings of different quality, (2) if respondents can reliably answer the questions used to create the 15-item index, and (3) if we can be reasonably confident that the index is a valid representation of quality. The next section presents the composite index and its distribution. …",2013,2013-01-01,5,"{'Sandra J. Newman', 'Philip M. E.

The housing and neighborhood conditions of America's children: patterns and trends over four decades,https://doi.org/10.1080/10511482.2011.567289,"This paper uses national and metropolitan area data from American Housing Surveys over four decades to examine the patterns and trends in the housing and neighborhood circumstances of children. Children across the income distribution have experienced dramatic improvements in the physical adequacy of their dwellings and in crowding but significant deterioration in housing affordability. Poor children are often in greatest jeopardy, with the rate of complaints about crime 25 percent higher in 2005 than in 1975, and the rate of school complaints twice as high in 2005 than 1975. Poor children also experience little payoff from residential mobility in terms of physical dwelling adequacy, crowding, affordability, or adequacy of schools, though moves are associated with fewer complaints about crime. However, it is the near poor – those between 101–200 percent of poverty – and not the poor who appear to be most affected by the tightness or looseness of the housing market.",2011,2011-03-01,42,"{'Sandra J.

Last in line: Housing assistance for households with children,https://doi.org/10.1080/10511482.1993.9521139,"Abstract This article examines the relationship between receipt of different types of rental housing assistance and housing outcomes for households with children. We rely on the 1989 American Housing Survey (AHS) and a special data supplement that attempted to accurately categorize every assisted renter‐occupied address in the AHS sample as either public housing; privately owned, federally assisted housing; or certificates and vouchers. Housing outcomes examined are physical condition of the unit, crowding, affordability, perceived neighborhood quality, and crime. We analyze three research questions: (1) Do the characteristics of households enrolled in housing programs differ by program type? (2) Do housing outcomes differ with the type of assistance received? (3) Do differences in household characteristics account for observed differences in program outcomes? The analysis suggests that the housing assistance system channels different types of households with children into different housing programs. The least disadvantaged households are most likely to end up in privately owned assisted stock, while the most disadvantaged end up in public housing. The most notable interprogram difference in housing outcomes relates to neighborhood quality. In contrast to other forms of rental assistance, residence in public housing is associated with a decline in neighborhood quality. This result holds even after controlling for household characteristics and geographic location of the unit.",1993,1993-01-01,34,"{'Sandra J. Newman', 'Ann B.

Race and Assisted Housing,https://doi.org/10.1080/10511482.2017.1311275,"This article explores racial disparities between assisted housing outcomes of black and white and white households with children. We compare the assisted housing occupied by black and white households with children, and examine whether young adult education, employment, and earnings outcomes in 2011 differ between blacks and whites who spent part of their childhood in assisted housing in the 2000s. We use a special version of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) that has been address-matched to federally assisted housing, and the PSID's Transition to Adulthood supplement, along with geocode-matched data from the U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey (ACS), CoreLogic real estate data, and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Statistical methods include difference in means, logit and general linear models. We find no evidence of racial disparities in the type of assisted housing program, the physical quality of project-based developments, or the management of public housing developments in the 2000 decade. But black households with children are more likely to live in assisted housing that is located in poorer quality neighborhoods. Multivariate tests reveal that the worse outcomes of black young adults compared with whites disappear once socioeconomic differences are taken into account. The discrepancy in assisted housing neighborhood quality experienced by black and white children makes no additional contribution to predicting young adult outcomes. Nonetheless, black children living in relatively better assisted housing neighborhoods tend to have better outcomes in young adulthood than those who live in poorer quality assisted housing neighborhoods. We discuss sources of racial disparity in neighborhood quality, and the policies enacted and proposed to address it.",2017,2017-05-03,7,"{'Sandra J. Newman', 'C.

"Comparing Disproportionate Exposure to Acute and Chronic Pollution Risks: A Case Study in Houston, Texas",https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.12224,"While environmental justice (EJ) research in the United States has focused primarily on the social distribution of chronic pollution risks, previous empirical studies have not analyzed disparities in exposure to both chronic (long‐term) and acute (short‐term) pollution in the same study area. Our article addresses this limitation though a case study that compares social inequities in exposure to chronic and acute pollution risks in the Greater Houston Metropolitan Statistical Area, Texas. The study integrates estimates of chronic cancer risk associated with ambient exposure to hazardous air pollutants from the Environmental Protection Agency's National‐Scale Air Toxics Assessment (2005), hazardous chemical accidents from the National Response Center's Emergency Response Notification System (2007–2011), and sociodemographic characteristics from the American Community Survey (2007–2011). Statistical analyses are based on descriptive comparisons, bivariate correlations, and locally derived spatial regression models that account for spatial dependence in the data. Results indicate that neighborhoods with a higher percentage of Hispanic residents, lower percentage of homeowners, and higher income inequality are facing significantly greater exposure to both chronic and acute pollution risks. The non‐Hispanic black percentage is significantly higher in neighborhoods with greater chronic cancer risk, but lower in areas exposed to acute pollution events. Households isolated by language—those highly likely to face evacuation problems during an actual chemical disaster—tend to reside in areas facing significantly greater exposure to high‐impact acute events. Our findings emphasize the growing need to examine social inequities in exposure to both chronic and acute pollution risks in future EJ research and policy.",2014,2014-06-09,77,"{'Jayajit Chakraborty', 'Timothy W.

"Sexual Orientation, Gender, and Environmental Injustice: Unequal Carcinogenic Air Pollution Risks in Greater Houston",https://doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2016.1218270,"Disparate residential hazard exposures based on disadvantaged gender status (e.g., among female-headed households) have been documented in the distributive environmental justice literature, yet no published studies have examined whether disproportionate environmental risks exist based on minority sexual orientation. To address this gap, we use data from the US Census, American Community Survey and the Environmental Protection Agency at the 2010 census tract level to examine the spatial relationships between same-sex partner households and cumulative cancer risk from exposure to hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) emitted by all ambient emission sources in Greater Houston (Texas). Findings from generalized estimating equation analyses demonstrate that increased cancer risks from HAPs are significantly associated with neighborhoods having relatively high concentrations of resident same-sex partner households, adjusting for geographic clustering and variables known to influence risk (i.e., race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, renter status, income inequality, and population density). However, HAP exposures are distributed differently for same-sex male versus same-sex female partner households. Neighborhoods with relatively high proportions of same-sex male partner households are associated with significantly greater exposure to cancer-causing HAPs while those with high proportions of same-sex female partner households are associated with less exposure. This study provides initial empirical documentation of a previously unstudied pattern, and infuses current theoretical understanding of environmental inequality formation with knowledge emanating from the sexualities and space literature. Practically, results suggest that other documented health risks experienced in gay neighborhoods may be compounded by disparate health risks associated with harmful exposures to air toxics.",2016,2016-09-30,37,"{'Danielle X.

"Environmental Injustice and Religion: Outdoor Air Pollution Disparities in Metropolitan Salt Lake City, Utah",https://doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2018.1546568,"The distributive environmental justice literature has expanded beyond examining only race- and class-based injustices, but no studies have focused on religion's influence on disparate environmental risks. We address that gap using data from the decennial U.S. Census, American Community Survey, and Environmental Protection Agency for 2010 census tracts to examine a proxy measure of Mormon prevalence, racial and ethnic composition, and socioeconomic status as predictors of seven indicators of outdoor air pollution in metropolitan Salt Lake City, Utah. Results from multivariate generalized estimating equation (GEE) analyses show that greater Mormon prevalence and white composition each independently predict lower levels of air pollution; moreover, Mormon prevalence and whiteness are the strongest predictors in the models. Results also demonstrate that greater proportions of Hispanic, black, and Pacific Islander residents predict higher levels of air pollution, suggesting that systemic white privilege oppresses those groups such that they experience air pollution disparities. Mormons are socially privileged in Salt Lake City, and findings indicate that their collective power serves to protect them from air pollution. Exploratory GEE interaction analyses reveal that disparities in exposure to particulate matter based on higher Hispanic composition are attenuated under conditions of high Mormon prevalence. Findings indicate that white privilege or racial oppression and Mormon privilege operate distinctively and, to a lesser degree, interactively as determinants of distributive environmental injustices in Salt Lake City. Although affiliation with a contextually dominant religion (Mormonism) among residents in Salt Lake City shapes neighborhood patterns of environmental inequality, future studies should examine the role of religion in both producing and ameliorating environmental injustice.

Numerous studies have identified inequities in heat exposure across different groups, but social identities have often been viewed in isolation from each other. Children (5 and under) and older adults (65 and older) also face elevated risks of heat-related health impacts. We employ an intersectional cross-classificatory approach to analyze the distribution of heat exposure between sociodemographic categories split into age groups in the contiguous US. We utilize high-resolution daily air temperature data to establish three census tract-level heat metrics (i.e., average summer temperature, heat waves, and heat island days). We pair those metrics with American Community Survey estimates on racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and disability status by age to calculate population weighted mean exposures and absolute disparity metrics. Our findings indicate few substantive differences between age groups overall, but more substantial differences between sociodemographic categories within age groups, with children and older adults from socially marginalized backgrounds facing greater exposure than adults from similar backgrounds. When looking at sociodemographic differences by age, people of color of any age and older adults without health insurance emerge as the most exposed groups.

Can Economic Deprivation Protect Health? Paradoxical Multilevel Effects of Poverty on Hispanic Children’s Wheezing,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph110807856,"Prior research suggests that economic deprivation has a generally negative influence on residents’ health. We employ hierarchical logistic regression modeling to test if economic deprivation presents respiratory health risks or benefits to Hispanic children living in the City of El Paso (Texas, USA) at neighborhood- and individual-levels, and whether individual-level health effects of economic deprivation vary based on neighborhood-level economic deprivation. Data come from the US Census Bureau and a population-based survey of El Paso schoolchildren. The dependent variable is children’s current wheezing, an established respiratory morbidity measure, which is appropriate for use with economically-deprived children with an increased likelihood of not receiving a doctor’s asthma diagnosis. Results reveal that economic deprivation (measured based on poverty status) at both neighborhood- and individual-levels is associated with reduced odds of wheezing for Hispanic children. A sensitivity analysis revealed similar significant effects of individual- and neighborhood-level poverty on the odds of doctor-diagnosed asthma. Neighborhood-level poverty did not significantly modify the observed association between individual-level poverty and Hispanic children’s wheezing; however, greater neighborhood poverty tends to be more protective for poor (as opposed to non-poor) Hispanic children.

Metrics Matter: Examining Chronic and Transient Poverty in the United States Using the Supplemental Poverty Measure,,"Author(s): Kimberlin, Sara | Advisor(s): Duerr Berrick, Jill | Abstract: The way poverty is measured shapes the types of policy solutions perceived to be possible and appropriate to address poverty, as poverty measurement produces information about who is poor, how many people are poor, and why they are poor. The traditional approach to measuring poverty in the United States suffers from two serious shortcomings, which limit the usefulness of the data produced to inform poverty policy. First, the official federal poverty measure (OPM) traditionally used to determine who qualifies as poor is based on consumption data from the 1960s and does not reflect current living patterns or costs of basic needs. Second, poverty in the United States is typically measured on an annual basis, using a cross-sectional analysis approach, which fails to capture information about the duration of poverty, though short-term poverty and long-term poverty have been shown to have different demographics, and long-term poverty is associated with more severe impacts on life outcomes. This study addresses these two shortcomings, by using an alternative poverty measure recently developed by the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), in place of the OPM to determine who qualifies as poor, and by analyzing poverty from a longitudinal rather than cross-sectional perspective, examining chronic or long-term poverty and transient or short-term poverty as distinct phenomena. Prior research has examined poverty in the U.S. using alternative poverty measures including the SPM, but only from a cross-sectional perspective. Other research has examined U.S. poverty from a longitudinal perspective, but using the OPM or a closely derived poverty measure. This study thus fills a gap in the existing research on poverty in the United States, by measuring poverty longitudinally using the better-grounded Supplemental Poverty Measure. Data for this study were drawn from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), a comprehensive nationally representative longitudinal dataset. Data included detailed household income, benefit, housing, and expense information used to construct annual poverty status using the SPM, as well as individual and household demographic variables, collected biennially from 1998 to 2008, thus representing six data years. Descriptive analysis was conducted using individuals as the unit of analysis (n= 8,375) while multivariate regression analysis was conducted using households as the unit of analysis (n=4,188). Complex survey weights were used in all analyses to adjust for differential sampling and attrition. Multiple imputation was used to impute missing values for one of the components used to construct SPM poverty status and for one of the demographic covariates. Chronic poverty was defined as poor under the SPM in more than half of the years examined (i.e. 4 or more of 6 years), while transient poverty was defined as poor under the SPM in at least one year but not more than half of the years (i.e. 1 to 3 of 6 years). Nonpoor was defined as not poor under the SPM in any year.Descriptive analysis was used to examine the prevalence and demographics of chronic and transient poverty, to compare the demographics of chronic and transient poverty using the Supplemental Poverty Measure versus using the official federal poverty measure, and to examine the impact of existing government benefits, private resources, and household expenses on chronic and transient poverty rates. Results showed that chronic poverty was a rare phenomenon, affecting only 2.1% of the sample or approximately 1 in 50 individuals, while transient poverty was fairly common, affecting 18.9% of the sample or approximately 1 in 20 individuals. The demographics of chronic and transient poverty were somewhat different, with groups that experienced high rates of transient poverty generally demonstrating even more disproportionately high rates of chronic poverty. Thus chronic poverty was more concentrated among particularly disadvantaged groups, while the population affected by transient poverty was still disadvantaged but more similar to the overall sample. The rates of chronic and transient poverty calculated using the SPM were statistically significantly different from the rates calculated using the official federal poverty measure, for both the overall sample and for many demographic subgroups. In general, chronic poverty rates were lower, and transient poverty rates were higher, when using the SPM versus using the OPM. Finally, government benefits were shown to have a substantial impact on both chronic and transient poverty rates, reducing the overall transient poverty rate from 23.9% to 18.9%, a difference of 5.0 percentage points, and reducing the overall chronic poverty rate from 10.8% to 2.1%, a reduction of 8.7 percentage points. One observed effect of government benefits was to increase household resources just enough to shift some individuals out of chronic poverty into transient poverty. The impact of government benefits on chronic and transient poverty rates was different for different demographic subgroups. Seniors experienced the greatest reduction in transient and especially chronic poverty rates, essentially due to Social Security, while children experienced less of a reduction. For immigrants, the dominant effect of government benefits was to shift individuals out of chronic into transient poverty.Multivariate regression, specifically multinomial logistic regression, was used to examine the predictors of transient and chronic poverty. Analysis specifically examined whether the predictors of each type of poverty, versus nonpoor status, corresponded to economic theory which posits that transient poverty is driven by temporary reductions in income (e.g. job layoff), while chronic poverty is driven by an inadequate long-term base of human and material assets needed to generate income (e.g. lack of education or presence of disability). Results showed that chronic poverty was significantly associated with asset limitations, including particularly non-high school graduate status, immigrant status, and long-term disability in a high housing cost area. Transient poverty was significantly associated with one variable linked to short-term income disruption, namely short-term unemployment. However, transient poverty was also significantly predicted by variables representing asset limitations, though most of these covariates had a stronger association with chronic poverty than transient poverty. The association of asset limitations with transient poverty appeared to be partly explained by the fact that government benefits shifted some asset-limited households, who would be expected to be chronically poor, out of chronic poverty and into transient poverty.Results of this study suggest implications for both research and policy. The finding that rates of chronic and transient poverty differ depending on whether the Supplemental Poverty Measure or official federal poverty measure is used suggests that researchers and policy analysts should consider using the SPM when analyzing longitudinal poverty, as the SPM has a stronger conceptual and empirical grounding than the OPM and did not simply function as a proxy for the OPM when examining poverty longitudinally in this study. Results related to the impact of government benefits on chronic and transient poverty rates suggest that policymakers should consider not just short-term policy impacts, but also the longitudinal impact of specific policies and of the overall package of government benefits on poverty. In addition, the differential impact of policies on chronic versus transient poverty, and on chronic and transient poverty among different demographic subgroups, should be considered. Findings related to the predictors of chronic versus transient poverty suggest that policies to address chronic poverty should target individuals with limited bases of human assets needed to generate income; such policies could function either through asset building or through long-term income supplementation or subsidies. Transient poverty could be addressed by enhancing short-term unemployment support, while policies targeted to asset-limited individuals would be likely to impact transient as well as chronic poverty. Further research to more clearly distinguish predictors of chronic poverty over and above transient poverty would be helpful for policy targeting purposes. Finally, prior research on the impact of chronic and transient poverty on life outcomes suggests that two types of poverty could be considered as priorities for policy interventions, due to greater impact on health and other outcomes, namely chronic poverty (as exposure to longer duration of poverty is associated with worse outcomes) and transient poverty occurring during the sensitive developmental period of childhood (as exposure to even short-term poverty during this sensitive period is associated with serious long-term health and developmental impacts). Results from this study show that addressing either of these two types of poverty could be feasible, if somewhat ambitious policy goals in terms of the number of individuals affected and the cumulative gap between their resources and needs.",2013,2013-01-01,18,{'Sara Kimberlin'},,"Income, Poverty, and Inequality; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Health disparities and outcomes",,article,Sara Kimberlin,https://openalex.org/A5073868525,American Community Survey; State - State Tax - California; Census Bureau; Stanford RDC,Census Bureau,Stanford
Immigrant Entrepreneurship in America: Evidence from the Survey of Business Owners 2007 & 2012,,"We study immigrant entrepreneurship and firm ownership in 2007 and 2012 using the Survey of Business Owners (SBO). The survival and growth of immigrant-owned businesses over time relative to native-founded companies is evaluated by linking the 2007 SBO to the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD). We quantify the dependency of the United States as a whole, as well as individual states, on the contributions of immigrant entrepreneurs in terms of firm formation and job creation. We describe differences in the types of businesses started by immigrants and the quality of jobs created by their firms. First-generation immigrants create about 25% of new firms in the United States, but this share exceeds 40% in some states. In addition, Asian and Hispanic second-generation immigrants start about 6% of new firms. Immigrant-owned firms, on average, create fewer jobs than native-owned firms, but much of this is explained by the industry and geographic location of the firms.

Immigration and Employer Transitions for STEM Workers,https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.103.3.193,"The firm is almost entirely absent from models of immigration, and yet firms play a central role for high-skilled immigration. The H-1B visa program, for example, is a firm-sponsored entry where firms are responsible for every stage: from identifying the immigrant, to employing them, to filing for permanent residency on behalf of the immigrant. This central role of firms for high-skilled immigration suggests the traditional lens for evaluating the impact of immigration on natives through local area labor markets or national age-education approaches may miss important dynamics. We analyze the employment and wage trajectories of high-skilled workers born in America when a high-skilled immigrant arrives at their work site. We use linked employer-employee data during the 1995-2008 period from the Census Bureau for this exercise, which identifies the immigration status and country-of-birth of workers. We follow the subsequent career path of workers after high-skilled immigration occurs to the employee's work site both within firms (e.g., changes in employee salary, relocation to other sites) and across firms (e.g., movements to new jobs or out of workforce, long-term salary adjustments). The richness and depth of the Census Bureau data allow for multiple comparison points: selection on observables (e.g., age, tenure, salary levels and recent growth), varying immigration treatments across different work sites for the same firm for otherwise comparable employees, and (for a subset of cases and short time period at the end of our sample) randomization in H-1B admission lotteries.",2013,2013-05-01,34,"{'William R.

"Inferentially Valid, Partially Synthetic Data: Generating from Posterior Predictive Distributions not Necessary",,"To limit the risks of disclosures when releasing public use data on individual records, statistical agencies and other data disseminators can release multiply-imputed, partially synthetic data (Little, 1993; Reiter, 2003). These comprise the units originally surveyed with some collected values, e.g. sensitive values at high risk of disclosure or values of quasi-identifiers, replaced with multiple imputations. Partially synthetic data can protect confidentiality, since identification of units and their sensitive data can be difficult when select values in the released data are not actual, collected values. And, with appropriate estimation methods based on the concepts of multiple imputation (Rubin, 1987), they enable data users to make valid inferences for a variety of estimands using standard, complete-data statistical methods and software. Because of these appealing features, partially synthetic data products have been developed for several major data sources in the U.S., including the Longitudinal Business Database (Kinney et al., 2011), the Survey of Income and Program Participation (Abowd et al., 2006), the American Community Survey group quarters data (Hawala, 2008), and the OnTheMap database of where people live and work (Machanavajjhala et al., 2008). Other examples of partially synthetic data are described in Abowd and Woodcock (2004), Little et al. (2004), Drechsler et al. (2008), and Drechsler and Reiter (2010). In the statistical theory underlying the generation of partially synthetic data, as well as typical implementations in practice, replacement values are sampled from posterior predictive distributions. That is, the agency repeatedly draws values of the model parameters from their posterior distributions, and generates a set of replacement values based on each parameter draw. The motivation for sampling from posterior predictive distributions derives from multiple imputation of missing data, in which drawing the parameters is necessary to enable approximately unbiased variance estimation (Rubin, 1987, Chapter 4). In this article, we argue that it is not necessary to draw parameters to enable valid inferences with partially synthetic data. Instead, data disseminators can estimate posterior modes or maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in synthesis models, and simulate replacement values after plugging those modes into the models. Using a simple but informative case, we show mathematically that point and variance estimates based on the plug-in",2012,2012-05-31,31,"{'Jerome P. Reiter', 'Satkartar K.

Commentary: Sharing Confidential Data for Research Purposes,https://doi.org/10.1097/ede.0b013e318225c44b,"In a recent editorial, the editors of Epidemiology invited authors to make their analytic and simulation codes, questionnaires, and data used in analyses available to other researchers.1 Much has been written about the need for data sharing and reproducible research, and many journals and funding agencies have explicit data-sharing policies.2,3 When data are confidential, however, investigators typically cannot release them as collected, because doing so could reveal data subjects' identities or values of sensitive attributes, thereby violating ethical and potentially legal obligations to protect confidentiality. At first glance, safely sharing confidential data seems a straightforward task: simply strip unique identifiers such as names, addresses, and identification numbers before releasing the data. However, these actions alone may not suffice when other identifying variables, such as geographic or demographic data, remain in the file. These quasi-identifiers can be used to match units in the released data to other databases. For example, Sweeney4 showed that 97% of the records in publicly available voter registration lists for Cambridge, MA, could be uniquely identified using birth date and 9-digit zip code. By matching the information in these lists, she was able to identify Massachusetts Governor William Weld in an anonymized medical database. As the amount of information readily available to the public continues to expand (eg, via the Internet and private companies), investigators releasing large-scale epidemiologic data run the risk of similar breaches. In this commentary, we present a primer on techniques for sharing confidential data. We classify techniques into 2 broad classes: restricted access, in which access is provided only to trusted users, and restricted data, in which the original data are somehow altered before sharing. Restricted-access Strategies Sharing unaltered confidential data with external researchers, while preserving confidentiality, is referred to as restricted-access methods. If one or more researchers have been trusted to analyze confidential data, it seems logical that they should be able to share the data with additional trusted researchers. However, researchers may be prevented by law or by the policies of their institution or sponsoring agency from sharing the data, even with their colleagues. Without procedures and rules for sharing data, there is little an individual researcher can do. There are 2 primary restricted-access methods employed by most data stewards, including government agencies and individual investigators: licensing agreements and restricted-data centers.5 Under the licensing model, researchers with legitimate research questions that can be answered with the confidential data enter into an agreement with the data steward and are provided with a copy of the data for use at their home institution. Typically, agreements specify how the data should be protected, and may require certification of destruction at project completion. Fees may be charged to cover data processing and administrative costs. In some cases, such as licensing agreements with the National Center for Education Statistics, the data are slightly altered to introduce a small amount of uncertainty, but not enough to concern analysts. In the data-center model, researchers must carry out their research in a physically and electronically secure facility controlled by the data steward. Researchers are often required to submit a proposal describing the research plans, the confidential data needed, and in some cases how their research will benefit the data steward. In additional to travel expenses, researchers may be required to pay substantial fees to access the data center, and they cannot remove any output without approval from the data steward. The US Census Bureau and National Center for Health Statistics provide researchers access to confidential data in this manner. An alternative is a secure online data center, such as the National Opinion Research Centers Virtual Data Enclave. Confidential data are stored on secure servers that approved researchers can access through remote login from prespecified IP addresses. The researcher can see and analyze the actual data, but the server disables local saving, printing of the data and analysis results, and cut-and-paste operations. As with a physical data enclave, analysis results are checked for potential disclosure violations by Center staff before being approved for publication outside the enclave. The virtual enclave has advantages over licensing models, in that the risks of breaches are centrally managed, for example, there are no misplaced CD ROMs or unapproved file sharing. A variant on the virtual data enclave is the remote analysis server. This is a query-based system that provides the results of analyses of confidential data without actually allowing users to see the confidential values, thus reducing disclosure risks.6–8 Examples include the US Census Bureau's American FactFinder, which is available to anyone but produces only tabular summaries, or the Australian Remote Access Data Laboratory, which restricts users but allows more flexible analyses. Other query-based methods under research include verification servers,9 which provide users with feedback on the quality of analyses based on redacted public use data, and output perturbation through differential privacy,10 whereby noise is added to query results, so that they do not provide information about any individual with certainty. Restricted-data Strategies Although restricted-access policies use trust and physical protection, restricted-data policies provide unfettered access to data that have been modified before release. The key issue for data stewards is determining how much alteration is needed to ensure protection without completely destroying the usefulness of the data. To make informed decisions about this trade-off, data stewards can quantify disclosure risk and data usefulness associated with particular release strategies. For example, when 2 competing policies result in approximately the same disclosure risk, the one with higher data usefulness should be selected. Quantifiable metrics can help data stewards decide when the risks are sufficiently low, and the usefulness is adequately high, to justify releasing the altered data.11,12 The literature on disclosure risk assessment highlights 2 main types of disclosures, namely (i) identification disclosures, which occur when an ill-intentioned user of the data (henceforth called an intruder) correctly identifies individual records in the released data, and (ii) attribute disclosures, which occur when an intruder learns the values of sensitive variables for individual records in the data. Attribute disclosures usually are preceded by identity disclosures—for example, when original values of attributes are released, intruders who correctly identify records learn the attribute values—so that focus typically is on identification-disclosure risk assessments. See the reports of the National Research Council13,14 and Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology15 for more information about attribute disclosure risks.16 Identification-disclosure risk measures are often based on estimates of the probabilities that individuals can be identified in the released data. Probabilities of identification are easily interpreted: the larger the probability, the greater the risk. Stewards determine their own threshold for unsafe probabilities. A variety of approaches have been used to estimate these probabilities.17–22 People who are unique in the population (as opposed to the sample) are particularly at risk.23 Therefore, much research has gone into estimating the probability that a sample unique record is in fact a population unique record.24,25 Usefulness of the data is usually assessed with 2 general approaches: (1) comparing broad differences between the original and released data and (2) comparing differences in specific models between the original and released data. Broad difference measures essentially quantify some statistical distance between the distributions of the data on the original and released files, for example, a Kullback-Leibler or Hellinger distance.26 As the distance between the distributions grows, the overall quality of the released data generally drops.27,28 Comparison of measures based on specific models is often performed informally. For example, the steward looks at the similarity of point estimates and standard errors of regression coefficients after fitting the same regression on the original data and on the data proposed for release. If the results are considered close (eg, if the confidence intervals obtained from the models largely overlap), the released data have high utility for that particular analysis.29 Such measures are closely tied to how the data are used, but they provide a limited representation of the overall quality of the released data. Thus, it is prudent to examine models that represent a wide range of uses of the released data. Risks can be reduced by altering data, using one or more statistical-disclosure-limitation strategies. Common approaches include coarsening, data swapping, noise addition, and synthetic data. Examples of coarsening include releasing geography as aggregated regions, reporting exact values only below or above certain thresholds (known as top or bottom coding), collapsing levels of categorical variables, and rounding numerical values. Recoding reduces disclosure risks by turning atypical records—which generally are most at risk—into typical records. Recodes frequently are specified to reduce estimated probabilities of identification to acceptable levels (eg, no cell in a cross-tabulation of a set of key categorical variables has fewer than k individuals, where k is often 3 or 5). Data swapping refers to switching the data values for selected records with those for other records.30 The protection afforded by swapping is based in large part on perception: data stewards expect that intruders will be discouraged from linking to external files, as any apparent matches could be incorrect due to the swapping. The details of the swapping mechanism are almost always kept secret to reduce the potential for reverse engineering. Adding random noise to sensitive or identifying data values can reduce disclosure risks because errors are introduced into the released data, making it difficult for intruders to match on the released values with confidence.31,32 For numerical data, typically, the noise is generated from a distribution with a mean of zero to ensure point estimates of means remain unbiased, although the variance associated with those estimated mean may increase. However, zero-mean noise still can lead to attenuation in point estimates of correlations and regression coefficients. Partially synthetic data methods replace some collected values, such as sensitive values at high risk of disclosure or values of key identifiers, with multiple imputations.8,33–35 For example, suppose that the steward wants to replace income when it exceeds $100,000—because the steward considers only these individuals to be at risk for disclosure—and is willing to release all other values as collected. (Alternatively, the steward could synthesize the key identifiers for persons with incomes exceeding $100,000 with the goal of reducing risks that these individuals might be identified.) The steward generates replacement values for the incomes over $100,000 by randomly simulating from the distribution of income conditional on all other variables. To avoid bias, this distribution must be conditional on income exceeding $100,000. The distribution is estimated using the collected data and possibly other relevant information. This yields one synthetic dataset. The steward repeats this process multiple times and releases the multiple datasets to the public. The multiple datasets enable secondary analysts to reflect the uncertainty from simulating replacement values in inferences. Among the restricted-data techniques described here, partial synthesis is the newest and least commonly used. A stronger version of synthetic data is full synthesis, in which all values in the released data are simulated.36,37 This approach may become appealing in the future, if confidentiality concerns grow to the point where no original data can be released in unrestricted public use files. CONCLUSION To reproduce research conducted on confidential data, researchers will likely need access to the same confidential data used by the original investigators. It is possible in some cases for restricted-data methods to be used, but for the purpose of reproducibility, restricted-access methods hold more promise. This is not to say that restricted-data methods do not have their place, as they enable many other benefits of data sharing. For both restricted data and restricted access, the methods that we describe may be too cumbersome for individual researchers to implement independently. We believe it is incumbent upon research institutions and sponsors, journals, and other advocates of reproducibility to facilitate sharing of confidential data by establishing procedures and policies for sharing confidential data and perhaps creating confidential data repositories. Authors who obtain their confidential data from such repositories could comply with a data-sharing invitation such as the one put forth by Epidemiology by providing detailed instructions for obtaining the confidential data.

Multivariate spatio‐temporal survey fusion with application to the American Community Survey and Local Area Unemployment Statistics,https://doi.org/10.1002/sta4.120,"There are often multiple surveys available that estimate and report related demographic variables of interest that are referenced over space and/or time. Not all surveys produce the same information, and thus, combining these surveys typically leads to higher quality estimates. That is, not every survey has the same level of precision nor do they always provide estimates of the same variables. In addition, various surveys often produce estimates with incomplete spatio‐temporal coverage. By combining surveys using a Bayesian approach, we can account for different margins of error and leverage dependencies to produce estimates of every variable considered at every spatial location and every time point. Specifically, our strategy is to use a hierarchical modelling approach, where the first stage of the model incorporates the margin of error associated with each survey. Then, in a lower stage of the hierarchical model, the multivariate spatio‐temporal mixed effects model is used to incorporate multivariate spatio‐temporal dependencies of the processes of interest. We adopt a fully Bayesian approach for combining surveys; that is, given all of the available surveys, the conditional distributions of the latent processes of interest are used for statistical inference. To demonstrate our proposed methodology, we jointly analyze period estimates from the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey, and estimates obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area Unemployment Statistics program.

Effects of a Government-Academic Partnership: Has the NSF-CENSUS Bureau Research Network Helped Improve the US Statistical System?,https://doi.org/10.1093/jssam/smy023,"Abstract The National Science Foundation-Census Bureau Research Network (NCRN) was established in 2011 to create interdisciplinary research nodes on methodological questions of interest and significance to the broader research community and to the Federal Statistical System (FSS), particularly to the Census Bureau. The activities to date have covered both fundamental and applied statistical research and have focused at least in part on the training of current and future generations of researchers in skills of relevance to surveys and alternative measurement of economic units, households, and persons. This article focuses on some of the key research findings of the eight nodes, organized into six topics: (1) improving census and survey data-quality and data collection methods; (2) using alternative sources of data; (3) protecting privacy and confidentiality by improving disclosure avoidance; (4) using spatial and spatio-temporal statistical modeling to improve estimates; (5) assessing data cost and data-quality tradeoffs; and (6) combining information from multiple sources.

Bayesian nonparametric multivariate spatial mixture mixed effects models with application to American Community Survey special tabulations,https://doi.org/10.1214/21-aoas1494,"Leveraging multivariate spatial dependence to improve the precision of estimates using American Community Survey data and other sample survey data has been a topic of recent interest among data users and federal statistical agencies. One strategy is to use a multivariate spatial mixed effects model with a Gaussian observation model and latent Gaussian process model. In practice, this works well for a wide range of tabulations. Nevertheless, in situations in which the data exhibit heterogeneity within or across geographies, and/or there is sparsity in the data, the Gaussian assumptions may be problematic and lead to underperformance. To remedy these situations, we propose a multivariate hierarchical Bayesian nonparametric mixed effects spatial mixture model to increase model flexibility.

Regionalization of Multiscale Spatial Processes by Using a Criterion for Spatial Aggregation Error,https://doi.org/10.1111/rssb.12179,"Summary The modifiable areal unit problem and the ecological fallacy are known problems that occur when modelling multiscale spatial processes. We investigate how these forms of spatial aggregation error can guide a regionalization over a spatial domain of interest. By ‘regionalization’ we mean a specification of geographies that define the spatial support for areal data. This topic has been studied vigorously by geographers but has been given less attention by spatial statisticians. Thus, we propose a criterion for spatial aggregation error, which we minimize to obtain an optimal regionalization. To define the criterion we draw a connection between spatial aggregation error and a new multiscale representation of the Karhunen–Loève expansion. This relationship between the criterion for spatial aggregation error and the multiscale Karhunen–Loève expansion leads to illuminating theoretical developments including connections between spatial aggregation error, squared prediction error, spatial variance and a novel extension of Obled–Creutin eigenfunctions. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through an analysis of two data sets: one using the American Community Survey and one related to environmental ocean winds.",2016,2016-05-10,48,"{'Scott H.

Small Area Estimation via Multivariate Fay–Herriot Models with Latent Spatial Dependence,https://doi.org/10.1111/anzs.12101,"Summary The Fay–Herriot model is a standard model for direct survey estimators in which the true quantity of interest, the superpopulation mean, is latent and its estimation is improved through the use of auxiliary covariates. In the context of small area estimation, these estimates can be further improved by borrowing strength across spatial regions or by considering multiple outcomes simultaneously. We provide here two formulations to perform small area estimation with Fay–Herriot models that include both multivariate outcomes and latent spatial dependence. We consider two model formulations. In one of these formulations the outcome‐by‐space dependence structure is separable. The other accounts for the cross dependence through the use of a generalized multivariate conditional autoregressive (GMCAR) structure. The GMCAR model is shown, in a state‐level example, to produce smaller mean square prediction errors, relative to equivalent census variables, than the separable model and the state‐of‐the‐art multivariate model with unstructured dependence between outcomes and no spatial dependence. In addition, both the GMCAR and the separable models give smaller mean squared prediction error than the state‐of‐the‐art model when conducting small area estimation on county level data from the American Community Survey.",2015,2015-02-22,46,"{'Christopher K.

Spatio‐temporal models for big multinomial data using the conditional multivariate logit‐beta distribution,https://doi.org/10.1111/jtsa.12468,"We introduce a Bayesian approach for analyzing high‐dimensional multinomial data that are referenced over space and time. In particular, the proportions associated with multinomial data are assumed to have a logit link to a latent spatio‐temporal mixed effects model. This strategy allows for covariances that are nonstationarity in both space and time, asymmetric, and parsimonious. We also introduce the use of the conditional multivariate logit‐beta distribution into the dependent multinomial data setting, which leads to conjugate full‐conditional distributions for use in a collapsed Gibbs sampler. We refer to this model as the multinomial spatio‐temporal mixed effects model (MN‐STM). Additionally, we provide methodological developments including: the derivation of the associated full‐conditional distributions, a relationship with a latent Gaussian process model, and the stability of the non‐stationary vector autoregressive model. We illustrate the MN‐STM through simulations and through a demonstration with public‐use quarterly workforce indicators data from the longitudinal employer household dynamics program of the US Census Bureau.",2019,2019-04-12,18,"{'Scott H.

Interpolating Population Distributions using Public-Use Data: An Application to Income Segregation using American Community Survey Data,https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2022.2126779,"The presence of income inequality is an important problem to demographers, policy makers, economists, and social scientists. A causal link has been hypothesized between income inequality and income segregation, which measures how much households with similar incomes cluster. The information theory index is used to measure income segregation, however, critics have suggested the divergence index instead. Motivated by this, we construct both indices using American Community Survey (ACS) estimates of features of the income distribution. Since the elimination of the decennial census long form, methods of computing these indices must be updated to interpolate ACS estimates and account for survey error. We propose a novel model-based method to do this which improves on previous approaches by using more types of estimates, and by providing uncertainty quantification. We apply this method to estimate U.S. census tract-level income distributions, and in turn use these to construct both income segregation indices. We find major differences between the two indices and find evidence that the information index underestimates the relationship between income inequality and income segregation. The literature suggests interventions designed to reduce income inequality by reducing income segregation, or vice versa, so using the information index implicitly understates the value of these interventions.

Bayesian Spatial Change of Support for Count-Valued Survey Data,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1405.7227,"We introduce Bayesian spatial change of support methodology for count-valued survey data with known survey variances. Our proposed methodology is motivated by the American Community Survey (ACS), an ongoing survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau that provides timely information on several key demographic variables. Specifically, the ACS produces 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year ""period-estimates,"" and corresponding margins of errors, for published demographic and socio-economic variables recorded over predefined geographies within the United States. Despite the availability of these predefined geographies it is often of interest to data users to specify customized user-defined spatial supports. In particular, it is useful to estimate demographic variables defined on ""new"" spatial supports in ""real-time."" This problem is known as spatial change of support (COS), which is typically performed under the assumption that the data follows a Gaussian distribution. However, count-valued survey data is naturally non-Gaussian and, hence, we consider modeling these data using a Poisson distribution. Additionally, survey-data are often accompanied by estimates of error, which we incorporate into our analysis. We interpret Poisson count-valued data in small areas as an aggregation of events from a spatial point process. This approach provides us with the flexibility necessary to allow ACS users to consider a variety of spatial supports in ""real-time.""

Bayesian binomial mixture models for estimating abundance in ecological monitoring studies,https://doi.org/10.1214/14-aoas801,"Investigation of species abundance has become a vital component of many ecological monitoring studies. The primary objective of these studies is to understand how specific species are distributed across the study domain, as well as quantification of the sampling efficiency for detecting these species. To achieve these goals, preselected locations are sampled during scheduled visits, in which the number of species observed at each location is recorded. This results in spatially referenced replicated count data that are often unbalanced in structure and exhibit overdispersion. Motivated by the Baltimore Ecosystem Study, we propose Bayesian hierarchical binomial mixture models, including Binomial Conway–Maxwell Poisson (Bin-CMP) mixture models, that formally account for varying levels of spatial dispersion. Our proposed models also allow for variable selection of model covariates and grouping of dispersion parameters through the implementation of reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology.

However, two main challenges occur in this context: accounting for an informative survey design and handling non‐Gaussian data types.

By combining these approaches, we attain a unit‐level model for count data that accounts for informative sampling designs and includes a fully Bayesian model uncertainty propagation.

Computationally Efficient Distribution Theory for Bayesian Inference of High-Dimensional Dependent Count-Valued Data,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1512.07273,"We introduce a Bayesian approach for multivariate spatio-temporal prediction for high-dimensional count-valued data. Our primary interest is when there are possibly millions of data points referenced over different variables, geographic regions, and times. This problem requires extensive methodological advancements, as jointly modeling correlated data of this size leads to the so-called ""big n problem."" The computational complexity of prediction in this setting is further exacerbated by acknowledging that count-valued data are naturally non-Gaussian. Thus, we develop a new computationally efficient distribution theory for this setting. In particular, we introduce a multivariate log-gamma distribution and provide substantial theoretical development including: results regarding conditional distributions, marginal distributions, an asymptotic relationship with the multivariate normal distribution, and full-conditional distributions for a Gibbs sampler. To incorporate dependence between variables, regions, and time points, a multivariate spatio-temporal mixed effects model (MSTM) is used. The results in this manuscript are extremely general, and can be used for data that exhibit fewer sources of dependency than what we consider (e.g., multivariate, spatial-only, or spatio-temporal-only data). Hence, the implications of our modeling framework may have a large impact on the general problem of jointly modeling correlated count-valued data. We show the effectiveness of our approach through a simulation study.

Analysis of Household Pulse Survey Public-Use Microdata via Unit-Level Models for Informative Sampling,https://doi.org/10.3390/stats5010010,"The Household Pulse Survey, recently released by the U.S. Census Bureau, gathers information about the respondents’ experiences regarding employment status, food security, housing, physical and mental health, access to health care, and education disruption. Design-based estimates are produced for all 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC), as well as 15 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). Using public-use microdata, this paper explores the effectiveness of using unit-level model-based estimators that incorporate spatial dependence for the Household Pulse Survey. In particular, we consider Bayesian hierarchical model-based spatial estimates for both a binomial and a multinomial response under informative sampling. Importantly, we demonstrate that these models can be easily estimated using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo through the Stan software package.

Spatio-Temporal Change of Support Modeling for the American Community Survey with R,,"Spatio-temporal change of support (STCOS) methods are designed for
statistical inference and prediction on spatial and temporal domains which may
differ from those of the observed data. Bradley, Wikle, and Holan (2015; Stat)
introduced a parsimonious class of Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal models
for STCOS for Gaussian data through a motivating application to the American
Community Survey (ACS), an ongoing survey administered by the U.S. Census
Bureau that measures key socioeconomic and demographic variables for various
populations in the United States. The methodology offers a principled approach
to compute model-based estimates, along with associated measures of
uncertainty, for ACS variables of interest on customized geographies and/or
time periods. However, users of ACS data who are unfamiliar with
spatio-temporal models could find the notion of implementing them to be
somewhat challenging. The present work seeks to bridge this gap by guiding
readers through STCOS computations in a detailed case-study. We focus on the R
computing environment because of its popularity, free availability, and high
quality contributed packages for geographic processing, data manipulation, and
more. We introduce the stcos package to facilitate computations for the STCOS
model. By providing a detailed guide through STCOS computations, the
methodology will become more broadly accessible to federal statistical agencies

Spatio-Temporal Change of Support with Application to American Community Survey Multi-Year Period Estimates,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1508.01451,"We present hierarchical Bayesian methodology to perform spatio-temporal change of support (COS) for survey data with Gaussian sampling errors. This methodology is motivated by the American Community Survey (ACS), which is an ongoing survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau that provides timely information on several key demographic variables. The ACS has published 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year period-estimates, and margins of errors, for demographic and socio-economic variables recorded over predefined geographies. The spatio-temporal COS methodology considered here provides data users with a way to estimate ACS variables on customized geographies and time periods, while accounting for sampling errors. Additionally, 3-year ACS period estimates are to be discontinued, and this methodology can provide predictions of ACS variables for 3-year periods given the available period estimates. The methodology is based on a spatio-temporal mixed effects model with a low-dimensional spatio-temporal basis function representation, which provides multi-resolution estimates through basis function aggregation in space and time. This methodology includes a novel parameterization that uses a target dynamical process and recently proposed parsimonious Moran's I propagator structures.

Bayesian Hierarchical Models For Multi-type Survey Data Using Spatially Correlated Covariates Measured With Error,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2211.09797,"We introduce Bayesian hierarchical models for predicting high-dimensional tabular survey data which can be distributed from one or multiple classes of distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Poisson, Binomial, etc.). We adopt a Bayesian implementation of a Hierarchical Generalized Transformation (HGT) model to deal with the non-conjugacy of non-Gaussian data models when estimated using a Latent Gaussian Process (LGP) model. Survey data are usually prone to a high degree of sampling error, and we use covariates that are prone to measurement error as well as those free of any such error. A classical measurement error component is defined to deal with the sampling error in the covariates. The proposed models can be high-dimensional and we employ the notion of basis function expansions to provide an effective approach to dimension reduction. The HGT component lends flexibility to our model to incorporate multi-type response datasets under a unified latent process model framework. To demonstrate the applicability of our methodology, we provide the results from simulation studies and data applications arising from a dataset consisting of the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year period estimates of the total population count under the poverty threshold and the ACS 5-year period estimates of median housing costs at the county level across multiple states in the USA.",2022,2022-01-01,2,"{'Saikat Nandy', 'Scott H.

Effects of a Government-Academic Partnership: Has the NSF-Census Bureau Research Network Helped Improve the U.S. Statistical System?,,"The National Science Foundation-Census Bureau Research Network (NCRN) was established in 2011 to create interdisciplinary research nodes on methodological questions of interest and significance to the broader research community and to the Federal Statistical System (FSS), particularly the Census Bureau.

This paper discusses some of the key research findings of the eight nodes, organized into six topics: (1) Improving census and survey data collection methods; (2) Using alternative sources of data; (3) Protecting privacy and confidentiality by improving disclosure avoidance; (4) Using spatial and spatio-temporal statistical modeling to improve estimates; (5) Assessing data cost and quality tradeoffs; and (6) Combining information from multiple sources. It also reports on collaborations across nodes and with federal agencies, new software developed, and educational activities and outcomes.

Conjugate Modeling Approaches for Small Area Estimation with Heteroscedastic Structure,https://doi.org/10.1093/jssam/smad002,"Abstract Small area estimation (SAE) has become an important tool in official statistics, used to construct estimates of population quantities for domains with small sample sizes. Typical area-level models function as a type of heteroscedastic regression, where the variance for each domain is assumed to be known and plugged in following a design-based estimate. Recent work has considered hierarchical models for the variance, where the design-based estimates are used as an additional data point to model the latent true variance in each domain. These hierarchical models may incorporate covariate information but can be difficult to sample from in high-dimensional settings. Utilizing recent distribution theory, we explore a class of Bayesian hierarchical models for SAE that smooth both the design-based estimate of the mean and the variance. In addition, we develop a class of unit-level models for heteroscedastic Gaussian response data. Importantly, we incorporate both covariate information as well as spatial dependence, while retaining a conjugate model structure that allows for efficient sampling. We illustrate our methodology through an empirical simulation study as well as an application using data from the American Community Survey.",2023,2023-02-25,1,"{'Scott H. Holan', 'Paul A.

Regionalization of Multiscale Spatial Processes using a Criterion for Spatial Aggregation Error,,"The modifiable areal unit problem and the ecological fallacy are known problems that occur when modeling multiscale spatial processes. We investigate how these forms of spatial aggregation error can guide a over a spatial domain of interest. By regionalization we mean a specification of geographies that define the spatial support for areal data. This topic has been studied vigorously by geographers, but has been given less attention by spatial statisticians. Thus, we propose a criterion for spatial aggregation error (CAGE), which we minimize to obtain an optimal regionalization. To define CAGE we draw a connection between spatial aggregation error and a new multiscale representation of the Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) expansion. This relationship between CAGE and the multiscale K-L expansion leads to illuminating theoretical developments including: connections between spatial aggregation error, squared prediction error, spatial variance, and a novel extension of Obled-Creutin eigenfunctions. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through an analysis of two datasets, one using the American Community Survey and one related to environmental ocean winds.",2015,2015-02-06,1,"{'Scott H.

We propose a model-based method to interpolate the disseminated estimates for a given variable of interest that improves on previous approaches by simultaneously allowing for the use of more types of estimates, incorporating the standard error of the estimates into the estimation process, and by providing uncertainty quantification so that, for example, interval estimates can be obtained for quantities of interest.

Interpolating Distributions for Populations in Nested Geographies using Public-use Data with Application to the American Community Survey,,"Statistical agencies often publish multiple data products from the same survey. First, they produce aggregate estimates of various features of the distributions of several socio-demographic quantities of interest. Often these area-level estimates are tabulated at small geographies. Second, statistical agencies frequently produce weighted public-use microdata samples (PUMS) that provide detailed information of the entire distribution for the same socio-demographic variables. However, the public-use micro areas usually constitute relatively large geographies in order to protect against the identification of households or individuals included in the sample. These two data products represent a trade-off in official statistics: publicly available data products can either provide detailed spatial information or detailed distributional information, but not both. We propose a model-based method to combine these two data products to produce estimates of detailed features of a given variable at a high degree of spatial resolution.

Recent Advances in Spatio‐Temporal Methodology,https://doi.org/10.1111/jtsa.12467,"This special issue consists of a collection of articles that describe innovations in spatio-temporal methodology. Spatio-temporal statistics has been developing at a rapid pace over the past 25 years. The topic is briefly covered in Cressie's (1993) comprehensive book on spatial statistics. Subsequently, Cressie and Wikle (2011) provided the first comprehensive book on spatio-temporal statistics, but it focused primarily on linear, univariate, and Gaussian methods. More recently, there have been numerous significant advancements in non-linear, multivariate, and non-Gaussian spatio-temporal methods, particularly those suited for ‘big’ data problems. Yet, each of these topic areas is relatively underdeveloped, and there are still many research challenges. Historically, spatio-temporal statistics methodology has developed more as an extension of spatial statistics rather than time series. That is, the emphasis has been on specification of models through their second-order structure, typically within a Gaussian process framework. Alternatively, dynamic spatio-temporal models (DSTMs) have been used to model processes for which it is more realistic to think of spatial processes evolving through time, that is, when it is more reasonable to think of the process conditionally (in time) rather than marginally (as with the Gaussian process framework). DSTMs often have model forms as in classical multivariate time series models, but they present unique challenges in that the types of relationships between space and time are often driven by mechanistic processes, and the associated statistical models must attempt to accommodate these relationships. In addition, the dimensionality of the spatial components of these models often prohibits the use of classical multivariate time series methods. Although much of the development of spatio-temporal methodology has been driven by environmental, epidemiological, and ecological applications (e.g. pollution monitoring, weather forecasting, climate, oceanography, disease mapping, invasive species, animal movement, etc.), there is an increasing number of novel methodologies that are motivated by the biological sciences (e.g. brain science), federal statistics (e.g. multivariate surveys, non-Gaussian change of support), sociological statistics (e.g. crime analysis), and econometric (e.g. multivariate panel) applications. Indeed, these processes are often multivariate, non-linear, and/or non-Gaussian. The articles in this special issue provide a representative snapshot of innovative work in these areas. Specifically, the articles selected for this issue highlight non-Gaussian spatio-temporal models, computational efficiency, and/or improving parameterizations of DSTMs. In their article ‘Scalable Inference for Space-Time Gaussian Cox Processes’, Shirota and Banerjee show how one can use an efficient data augmentation approach in conjunction with nearest-neighbor log-Gaussian processes to efficiently model count (crime event) data via spatio-temporal Gaussian Cox processes. In ‘Estimating Spatial Changes Over Time of Artic Sea Ice Using Hidden 2 × 2 Tables’, Zhang and Cressie consider non-Gaussian (Bernoulli) data on the presence/absence of sea ice. The model is cast in an efficient manner by using dimension-reduced spatio-temporal processes in an EM algorithm, cleverly describing the process as time-varying 2 × 2 tables. Tagle, Castruccio, Crippa, and Genton, in their article ‘A Non-Gaussian Spatio-Temporal Model for Daily Wind Speeds Based on a Multivariate Skew-T Distribution’, show how to build an efficient and realistic ‘weather generator’ for daily wind speeds that is able to simulate the type of skewed distributions that are often found in weather variables. In their article ‘On a Semiparametric Data-Driven Nonlinear Model with Penalized Spatio-Temporal Lag Interactions’, Al-Sulami, Jiang, Lu, and Zhu consider a non-linear (semiparametric) regression spatio-temporal model that also includes a dynamic interaction term and consider an adaptive lasso approach for selecting the space–time lag interactions that are most useful (in their example, to model US housing price data). Their methodology does not rely on a Gaussian error assumption. In the spirit of efficient modeling of the spatio-temporal terms beyond a trend and seasonality, Gao and Tsay present an efficient structured factor approach for multivariate time series and spatio-temporal data (e.g. PM2.5 pollutant observations) in their article ‘A Structural-Factor Approach to Modeling High-Dimensional Time Series and Space-Time Data’. Finally, in their article ‘Spatio-Temporal Models for Big Multinomial Data Using the Conditional Multivariate Logit-Beta Distribution’, Bradley, Wikle and Holan develop a novel efficient conjugate Bayesian algorithm to model high-dimensional spatio-temporal multinomial data, which includes a spatio-temporal dynamic process. They apply this model to public-use Quarterly Workforce Indicators from the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics program of the US Census Bureau. These articles provide excellent examples of how spatio-temporal statistical models can be applied to address complex non-Gaussian, non-linear, and multivariate data with efficient computational algorithms. These problems are by no means ‘solved’, but it is our hope that the readers of the Journal of Time Series Analysis may see connections to their own work that can be applied to this rich set of problems and this growing and important area of statistics.

A Conversation with David Findley,https://doi.org/10.1214/12-sts388,"David Findley was born in Washington, DC on December 27, 1940. After attending high school in Lyndon, Kentucky, he earned a B.S. (1962) and M.A. (1963) in mathematics from the University of Cincinnati. He then lived in Germany, studying functional analysis under Gottfried Köthe, obtaining a Ph.D. from the University of Frankfurt in 1967. Returning to the United States, he served as a mathematics professor at the University of Cincinnati until 1975. Having transitioned from pure mathematics to statistical time series analysis, Findley took a new academic position at the University of Tulsa, during which time he interacted frequently with the nearby research laboratories of major oil companies and consulted regularly for Cities Service Oil Company (now Citgo). In 1980 he was invited to lead the seasonal adjustment research effort at the U.S. Census Bureau, and eventually rose to be a Senior Mathematical Statistician before his retirement in 2009. In 1966 he married Mary Virginia Baker, and they currently live in Washington, DC. David Findley has published more than 40 journal articles and book chapters, as well as dozens of technical reports and conference proceedings, many of which are heavily cited and influential. He has also published two edited volumes (1978 and 1981) that have had a substantial impact on the field of time series analysis. Numerous honors and awards have accrued to him, including ASA Fellow (1987), the Julius Shiskin award (1996) and the U.S. Department of Commerce Gold Medal (1997).",2012,2012-11-01,0,"{'Scott H.

Bayesian Unit-level Models for Longitudinal Survey Data under Informative Sampling: An Analysis of Expected Job Loss Using the Household Pulse Survey,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2304.07897,"The Household Pulse Survey (HPS), recently released by the U.S. Census Bureau, gathers timely information about the societal and economic impacts of coronavirus. The first phase of the survey was quickly launched one month after the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic and ran for 12 weeks. To track the immediate impact of the pandemic, individual respondents during this phase were re-sampled for up to three consecutive weeks. Motivated by expected job loss during the pandemic, using public-use microdata, this work proposes unit-level, model-based estimators that incorporate longitudinal dependence at both the response and domain level. In particular, using a pseudo-likelihood, we consider a Bayesian hierarchical unit-level, model-based approach for both Gaussian and binary response data under informative sampling. To facilitate construction of these model-based estimates, we develop an efficient Gibbs sampler. An empirical simulation study is conducted to compare the proposed approach to models that do not account for unit-level longitudinal correlation. Finally, using public-use HPS micro-data, we provide an analysis of ""expected job loss"" that compares both design-based and model-based estimators and demonstrates superior performance for the proposed model-based approaches.",2023,2023-01-01,0,"{'Daniel Vedensky', 'Paul A.

Regionalization of Multiscale Spatial Processes using a Criterion for Spatial Aggregation Error,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1502.01974,"The modifiable areal unit problem and the ecological fallacy are known problems that occur when modeling multiscale spatial processes. We investigate how these forms of spatial aggregation error can guide a regionalization over a spatial domain of interest. By ""regionalization"" we mean a specification of geographies that define the spatial support for areal data. This topic has been studied vigorously by geographers, but has been given less attention by spatial statisticians. Thus, we propose a criterion for spatial aggregation error (CAGE), which we minimize to obtain an optimal regionalization. To define CAGE we draw a connection between spatial aggregation error and a new multiscale representation of the Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) expansion. This relationship between CAGE and the multiscale K-L expansion leads to illuminating theoretical developments including: connections between spatial aggregation error, squared prediction error, spatial variance, and a novel extension of Obled-Creutin eigenfunctions.

Bayesian Methods Applied to Small Area Estimation for Establishment Statistics,https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119672333.ch30,"Establishment survey data is frequently used to estimate population level characteristics of organizations rather than individuals. For large domains of interest, direct survey estimates may fare well; however, when interest lies in domains that contain relatively few samples, direct survey estimates are inefficient, leading to the need for small area models. These models rely on various dependencies within the data in order to ""borrow information,"" leading to more precise estimates. Dependencies may include covariates, spatial dependence, temporal dependence, multivariate relationships, or in the case of establishment surveys specifically, dependence on industry classification. Bayesian hierarchical modeling provides a natural foundation for modeling sources of dependence, and thus also a natural framework for small area estimation of establishment statistics. Within this Bayesian framework, there are two separate overarching modeling approaches. The first approach is to use area-level models, which treat the direct survey estimates as the response, and then ""smooth"" these estimates through the modeling hierarchy. In contrast, unit-level models, which do not consider the direct estimates, instead, model the sampled units directly. There are positive and negative trade-offs under both approaches and, in this work, we give an overview of various Bayesian methods that fall under both categories. In addition, based on the 2007 Survey of Business Owners (SBO) administered by the U.S. Census Bureau, we conduct an empirical simulation study as well as a data analysis that compare a subset of the methods introduced.",2023,2023-01-20,0,"{'Scott H.

Conjugate Modeling Approaches for Small Area Estimation with Heteroscedastic Structure,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2209.01670,"Small area estimation has become an important tool in official statistics, used to construct estimates of population quantities for domains with small sample sizes. Typical area-level models function as a type of heteroscedastic regression, where the variance for each domain is assumed to be known and plugged in following a design-based estimate. Recent work has considered hierarchical models for the variance, where the design-based estimates are used as an additional data point to model the latent true variance in each domain. These hierarchical models may incorporate covariate information, but can be difficult to sample from in high-dimensional settings. Utilizing recent distribution theory, we explore a class of Bayesian hierarchical models for small area estimation that smooth both the design-based estimate of the mean and the variance. In addition, we develop a class of unit-level models for heteroscedastic Gaussian response data. Importantly, we incorporate both covariate information as well as spatial dependence, while retaining a conjugate model structure that allows for efficient sampling. We illustrate our methodology through an empirical simulation study as well as an application using data from the American Community Survey.",2022,2022-01-01,0,"{'Scott H. Holan', 'Paul A.

Development of a heat vulnerability index for New York State,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2017.09.006,"The frequency and intensity of extreme heat events are increasing in New York State (NYS) and have been linked with increased heat-related morbidity and mortality. But these effects are not uniform across the state and can vary across large regions due to regional sociodemographic and environmental factors which impact an individual's response or adaptive capacity to heat and in turn contribute to vulnerability among certain populations. We developed a heat vulnerability index (HVI) to identify heat-vulnerable populations and regions in NYS. Census tract level environmental and sociodemographic heat-vulnerability variables were used to develop the HVI to identify heat-vulnerable populations and areas. Variables were identified from a comprehensive literature review and climate-health research in NYS. We obtained data from 2010 US Census Bureau and 2011 National Land Cover Database. We used principal component analysis to reduce correlated variables to fewer uncorrelated components, and then calculated the cumulative HVI for each census tract by summing up the scores across the components. The HVI was then mapped across NYS (excluding New York City) to display spatial vulnerability. The prevalence rates of heat stress were compared across HVI score categories. Thirteen variables were reduced to four meaningful components representing 1) social/language vulnerability; 2) socioeconomic vulnerability; 3) environmental/urban vulnerability; and 4) elderly/ social isolation. Vulnerability to heat varied spatially in NYS with the HVI showing that metropolitan areas were most vulnerable, with language barriers and socioeconomic disadvantage contributing to the most vulnerability. Reliability of the HVI was supported by preliminary results where higher rates of heat stress were collocated in the regions with the highest HVI. The NYS HVI showed spatial variability in heat vulnerability across the state. Mapping the HVI allows quick identification of regions in NYS that could benefit from targeted interventions. The HVI will be used as a planning tool to help allocate appropriate adaptation measures like cooling centers and issue heat alerts to mitigate effects of heat in vulnerable areas.",2017,2017-12-01,175,"{'Cristian Pantea', 'Neil Muscatiello', 'Wan‐Hsiang Hsu', 'Syni‐An Hwang', 'Scott C.

Reducing Uncertainty in the American Community Survey through Data-Driven Regionalization,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0115626,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is the largest survey of US households and is the principal source for neighborhood scale information about the US population and economy. The ACS is used to allocate billions in federal spending and is a critical input to social scientific research in the US. However, estimates from the ACS can be highly unreliable. For example, in over 72% of census tracts, the estimated number of children under 5 in poverty has a margin of error greater than the estimate. Uncertainty of this magnitude complicates the use of social data in policy making, research, and governance. This article presents a heuristic spatial optimization algorithm that is capable of reducing the margins of error in survey data via the creation of new composite geographies, a process called regionalization. Regionalization is a complex combinatorial problem. Here rather than focusing on the technical aspects of regionalization we demonstrate how to use a purpose built open source regionalization algorithm to process survey data in order to reduce the margins of error to a user-specified threshold.",2015,2015-02-27,81,"{'Seth Spielman', 'David C.

Studying Neighborhoods Using Uncertain Data from the American Community Survey: A Contextual Approach,https://doi.org/10.1080/00045608.2015.1052335,"In 2010 the American Community Survey (ACS) replaced the long form of the decennial census as the sole national source of demographic and economic data for small geographic areas such as census tracts. These small area estimates suffer from large margins of error, however, which makes the data difficult to use for many purposes. The value of a large and comprehensive survey like the ACS is that it provides a richly detailed, multivariate, composite picture of small areas. This article argues that one solution to the problem of large margins of error in the ACS is to shift from a variable-based mode of inquiry to one that emphasizes a composite multivariate picture of census tracts. Because the margin of error in a single ACS estimate, like household income, is assumed to be a symmetrically distributed random variable, positive and negative errors are equally likely. Because the variable-specific estimates are largely independent from each other, when looking at a large collection of variables these random errors average to zero. This means that although single variables can be methodologically problematic at the census tract scale, a large collection of such variables provides utility as a contextual descriptor of the place(s) under investigation. This idea is demonstrated by developing a geodemographic typology of all U.S. census tracts. The typology is firmly rooted in the social scientific literature and is organized around a framework of concepts, domains, and measures. The typology is validated using public domain data from the City of Chicago and the U.S. Federal Election Commission. The typology, as well as the data and methods used to create it, is open source and published freely online.",2015,2015-08-18,77,"{'Seth Spielman', 'Alex Singleton'}",University of Colorado Boulder; University of Liverpool,"Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Urban Transport and Accessibility; Spatial and Panel Data Analysis",Annals of the Association of American Geographers,article,Seth E Spielman,https://openalex.org/A5078177514,American Community Survey; BOC Master Address File Auxiliary Reference File (MAFARF); Master Address File Extract,American Community Survey,Colorado
Navigating Statistical Uncertainty: How Urban and Regional Planners Understand and Work With American Community Survey (ACS) Data for Guiding Policy,https://doi.org/10.1080/01944363.2018.1440182,"Problem, research strategy, and findings: The American Community Survey (ACS) is a crucial source of socio­demographic data for planners. Since ACS data are estimates rather than actual counts, they contain a degree of statistical uncertainty—referred to as margin of error (MOE)—that planners must navigate when using these data. The statistical uncertainty is magnified when one is working with data for small areas or subgroups of the population or cross-tabulating demographic characteristics. We interviewed (n = 7) and surveyed (n = 200) planners and find that many do not understand the statistical uncertainty in ACS data, find it difficult to communicate statistical uncertainty to stakeholders, and avoid reporting MOEs altogether. These practices may conflict with planners' ethical obligations under the AICP Code of Ethics to disclose information in a clear and direct way.Takeaway for practice: We argue that the planning academy should change its curriculum requirements and that the profession should improve professional development training to ensure planners understand data uncertainty and convey it to users. We suggest planners follow 5 guidelines when using ACS data: Report MOEs, indicate when they are not reporting MOEs, provide context for the level of statistical reliability, consider alternatives for reducing statistical uncertainty, and always conduct statistical tests when comparing ACS estimates.",2018,2018-04-03,22,"{'David C.

Uncertain Uncertainty: Spatial Variation in the Quality of American Community Survey Estimates,,"The U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) is the foundation of social science research, much federal resource allocation and the development of public policy and private sector decisions. However, the high uncertainty associated with some of the ACS’s most frequently used estimates can jeopardize the accuracy of inferences based on these data. While there is high level understanding in the research community that problems exist in the data, the sources and implications of these problems have been largely overlooked. Using 2006{2010 ACS median household income at the census tract scale as the test case (where a third of small-area estimates have higher than recommend errors), we explore the patterns in the uncertainty of ACS data. We consider various potential sources of uncertainty in the data, ranging from response level to geographic location to characteristics of the place. We nd that there exist systematic patterns in the uncertainty in both the spatial and attribute dimensions. Using a regression framework, we identify the factors that are most frequently correlated with the error at national, regional and metropolitan area scales, and nd these correlates are not consistent across the various locations tested. The implication is that data quality varies in dierent places, making cross-sectional analysis both within and across regions less reliable.

Segmentation using large language models: A new typology of American neighborhoods,https://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-024-00466-1,"Abstract In the United States, recent changes to the National Statistical System have amplified the geographic-demographic resolution trade-off. That is, when working with demographic and economic data from the American Community Survey, as one zooms in geographically one loses resolution demographically due to very large margins of error. In this paper, we present a solution to this problem in the form of an AI based open and reproducible geodemographic classification system for the United States using small area estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS). We employ a partitioning clustering algorithm to a range of socio-economic, demographic, and built environment variables. Our approach utilizes an open source software pipeline that ensures adaptability to future data updates. A key innovation is the integration of GPT4, a state-of-the-art large language model, to generate intuitive cluster descriptions and names. This represents a novel application of natural language processing in geodemographic research and showcases the potential for human-AI collaboration within the geospatial domain.",2024,2024-04-22,2,"{'Seth Spielman', 'Alex Singleton'}",University of Liverpool; Microsoft (United States),Human Mobility and Location-Based Analysis; demographic modeling and climate adaptation; Urban Transport and Accessibility,EPJ Data Science,article,Seth E Spielman,https://openalex.org/A5078177514,American Community Survey; BOC Master Address File Auxiliary Reference File (MAFARF); Master Address File Extract,American Community Survey,Colorado

Effects of a Government-Academic Partnership: Has the NSF-CENSUS Bureau Research Network Helped Improve the US Statistical System?,https://doi.org/10.1093/jssam/smy023,"Abstract The National Science Foundation-Census Bureau Research Network (NCRN) was established in 2011 to create interdisciplinary research nodes on methodological questions of interest and significance to the broader research community and to the Federal Statistical System (FSS), particularly to the Census Bureau.

This article focuses on some of the key research findings of the eight nodes, organized into six topics: (1) improving census and survey data-quality and data collection methods; (2) using alternative sources of data; (3) protecting privacy and confidentiality by improving disclosure avoidance; (4) using spatial and spatio-temporal statistical modeling to improve estimates; (5) assessing data cost and data-quality tradeoffs; and (6) combining information from multiple sources.

Studying Neighborhoods Using Uncertain Data from the American Community Survey: A Contextual Approach,https://doi.org/10.1080/00045608.2015.1052335,"In 2010 the American Community Survey (ACS) replaced the long form of the decennial census as the sole national source of demographic and economic data for small geographic areas such as census tracts. These small area estimates suffer from large margins of error, however, which makes the data difficult to use for many purposes. The value of a large and comprehensive survey like the ACS is that it provides a richly detailed, multivariate, composite picture of small areas. This article argues that one solution to the problem of large margins of error in the ACS is to shift from a variable-based mode of inquiry to one that emphasizes a composite multivariate picture of census tracts. Because the margin of error in a single ACS estimate, like household income, is assumed to be a symmetrically distributed random variable, positive and negative errors are equally likely. Because the variable-specific estimates are largely independent from each other, when looking at a large collection of variables these random errors average to zero. This means that although single variables can be methodologically problematic at the census tract scale, a large collection of such variables provides utility as a contextual descriptor of the place(s) under investigation. This idea is demonstrated by developing a geodemographic typology of all U.S. census tracts. The typology is firmly rooted in the social scientific literature and is organized around a framework of concepts, domains, and measures. The typology is validated using public domain data from the City of Chicago and the U.S. Federal Election Commission. The typology, as well as the data and methods used to create it, is open source and published freely online.",2015,2015-08-18,77,"{'Seth Spielman', 'Alex Singleton'}",University of Colorado Boulder; University of Liverpool,"Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Urban Transport and Accessibility; Spatial and Panel Data Analysis",Annals of the Association of American Geographers,article,Seth E Spielman,https://openalex.org/A5078177514,FSRDC; Colorado RDC; Decennial Census; Census Bureau,Decennial Census,Colorado
Who are the People in my Neighborhood?: The “Contextual Fallacy” of Measuring Individual Context with Census Geographies,https://doi.org/10.1111/gean.12192,"Scholars frequently use counts of populations aggregated into geographic units like census tracts to represent measures of neighborhood context. Decades of research confirm that variation in how individuals are aggregated into geographic units can dramatically alter analyses conducted with these units. While most researchers are aware of the problem, they have lacked the tools to determine its magnitude or its capacity to affect analytical results obtained using these contextual measures. Using confidential access to the complete 2010 U.S. Decennial Census, we can construct—for all persons in the U.S.—individual‐specific contexts, which we group according to Census‐assigned block, block group, and tract. We compare these individual‐specific measures to the published statistics at each scale, and we then determine the degree to which published measures could be affected by how boundaries are drawn using a simple statistic, the standard deviation of individual context (SDIC). For three key measures (percent Black, percent Hispanic, and Entropy—a measure of ethno‐racial diversity), we find that block‐level Census statistics frequently contain a high degree of uncertainty meaning that they may not capture the actual context of individuals within them. More problematic, we uncover systematic spatial patterns in the uncertainty associated with contextual variables at all three scales.",2019,2019-02-21,32,"{'David C.

Measurement of Higher Education in the Census and Current Population Survey,https://doi.org/10.1198/016214503000000369,"We examine measurement error in the reporting of higher education in the 1990 Decennial Census and the post-1991 Current Population Survey (CPS). We document that measurement error in the reporting of higher education is prevalent in Census data. Further, these errors violate models of classical measurement error in important ways. The level of education is consistently reported as higher than it is (errors are not mean 0), errors in the reporting of education are correlated with covariates that appear in earnings regressions, and errors in the reporting of education appear correlated with the error term in a model of earnings determination. Thus, neither well-known results on classical measurement error nor recent models of nonclassical measurement error are likely valid when using Census and CPS data. We find some evidence that the measurement error is lower in the CPS than in the Census, presumably because first interviews are generally conducted in person.",2003,2003-09-01,126,"{'Seth Sanders', 'Lowell J.

Incorporating perceived best practices from previous initiatives, the CCTC combines explicit eligibility thresholds with some discretion on the part of program officials to select tax credit recipients. The structure and implementation of the program facilitates rigorous evaluation. We exploit detailed data on accepted and rejected applicants to the CCTC, including information on the scoring of applicants with regard to program goals as well as on funding decisions, together with restricted-access American Community Survey (ACS) data on local economic conditions. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that each CCTC-incentivized job in a census tract increases the number of individuals working in that tract by close to 3 – a significant local multiplier. Local multipliers are larger for non-manufacturing awards than for manufacturing awards. CCTC awards increase employment among workers across socioeconomic groups and in more- as well as less-advantaged neighborhoods, but have limited impact on residents of affected communities.

Trends in Minority Commuting Behavior: What Does the American Community Survey Tell Us?,,"Two currently important aspects of transportation research are addressed in this paper, the changing nature of travel behavior among the growing minority groups and the potential utility of the American Community Survey (ACS) as an emerging source of travel information. With minority groups growing in population (the Chicago metropolitan area is projected to be more than half ‘minority’ by 2030), the commuting patterns and trends of this population need close examination. We find that, overall, minorities have higher travel times to work, but in suburban Chicago they have lower travel times. We now have sufficient data in the ACS to make this assessment and address some of the key questions regarding commuting behavior. We find that the ACS data for Illinois, from 2000 to 2003, reveals only a few short-term trends, such as growing minority populations and increasing tendency to drive to work, but that the travel times and mode use have not changed substantially throughout the study period, 2000-2003. These findings support the intent of the US Census Bureau to aggregate several years of data, at increased sample sizes, so that researchers and planners alike may study patterns and trend at small levels of geographic detail. At the same time, caution needs to be exercised in analyzing aggregate data for variables that exhibit change over time. The key here is the change over short periods of time, five years, rather than long-term changes that are common in travel behavior.",2006,2006-01-01,0,"{'S Sööt', 'Joost Gideon Berman'}",,"Urban Transport and Accessibility; Transportation Planning and Optimization; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies",Transportation Research Board 85th Annual MeetingTransportation Research Board,article,Siim Soot,https://openalex.org/A5017869842,American Community Survey; Chicago RDC; FSRDC; American Community Survey Unedited Microdata; Census Bureau,American Community Survey; Census Bureau,Chicago
COMMUTING IN THE CHICAGO AREA: EMERGING TRENDS,,"As part of the decennial census the Census Bureau collects information on where we live and where we work. Using these data the authors will show that from 1970 to 2000 the Chicago area experienced an evolutionary change in economic activity and traffic. As will be seen, several existing trends were extended, some new ones emerged while others demonstrated a marked shift. This report provides a brief overview of the most noteworthy changes in commuting patterns since 1970. It highlights a substantial decline in bedroom communities. All of the collar counties experienced major increases in commutes to the county. DuPage County experienced a growth of more than 100,000 commuters to the county (23%) while Lake County registered a lower growth in numbers (81,000) but a higher percentage change (33%). Now, they both import more commuters than they export. They are no longer places with stereotypical bedroom communities. More importantly, the growth in population now outpaced the growth in commuters for the first time in at least forty years. Specifically the alarms raised in the 1970s and 1980s about major increases in congestion due to expected increases in population have not materialized. Still congestion has increased with longer commutes, perhaps reflecting the increasing specialization in our labor force resulting in an expanded geographic pool from which workers are drawn.",2003,2003-03-28,1,"{'S Sööt', 'Joseph DiJohn', 'Ed Christopher'}",,Urban Transport and Accessibility; Transportation Planning and Optimization,,article,Siim Soot,https://openalex.org/A5017869842,American Community Survey; Chicago RDC; FSRDC; American Community Survey Unedited Microdata; Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Chicago
"Emerging Commuting and Urban Development Trends in the New Millennium: Six-County Chicago Area, 1970 - 2008",,"The Census Bureau collects information on where we live and where we work. Using this data the authors show that from 1970 to 2008 the pattern of commuting continues to change in the six-county metropolitan area, as population and jobs increase in collar counties. Several existing trends have continued, some new ones have emerged and others have demonstrated a marked shift. This report provides a brief overview of the most noteworthy of these changes in commuting since 2000 and interprets these changes by contrasting them with the previous forty years (since 1970). It highlights a substantial shift in bedroom communities, where the number of workers outnumbers the number of jobs. All of the collar counties have experienced major increases in commutes into the county. DuPage County again has more commuters coming to the county then leaving it, now by more than 90,000 workers. Lake County also has more commuting to the county than from the county. Job growth in the collar counties contributes to the continued trend of cross county border commuting. Several new trends emerged: travel times are no longer growing in all counties; job growth exceeded the rate of increases in previous decades; increases in population and commuters in the six-county region were nearly equivalent at approximately 350,000; in terms of population and job growth as well as changes in commuting time, Cook and DuPage now together constitute the metropolitan core; and commuting to Cook County from all counties is no longer growing.",2011,2011-01-01,0,"{'S Sööt', 'Joseph DiJohn', 'Ed Christopher'}",,Urban Transport and Accessibility; Transportation Planning and Optimization,,article,Siim Soot,https://openalex.org/A5017869842,American Community Survey; Chicago RDC; FSRDC; American Community Survey Unedited Microdata; Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Chicago
Testing biasedness of self-reported microbusiness innovation in the annual business survey,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0296667,"This study tests for potential bias in self-reported innovation due to the inclusion of a research and development (R&amp;D) module that only microbusinesses (less than 10 employees) receive in the Annual Business Survey (ABS). Previous research found that respondents to combined innovation/R&amp;D surveys reported innovation at lower rates than respondents to innovation-only surveys. A regression discontinuity design is used to test whether microbusinesses, which constitute a significant portion of U.S. firms with employees, are less likely to report innovation compared to other small businesses. In the vicinity of the 10-employee threshold, the study does not detect statistically significant biases for new-to-market and new-to-business product innovation. Statistical power analysis confirms the nonexistence of biases with a high power. Comparing the survey design of ABS to earlier combined innovation/R&amp;D surveys provides valuable insights for the proposed integration of multiple Federal surveys into a single enterprise platform survey.

Using Household Pulse Survey data from the Census Bureau, we find the pandemic significantly impacted both food sufficiency and mental health, with food insufficiency having a larger negative impact on mental health than income loss. Unemployment was associated with better mental health, possibly due to reduced fear of exposure to COVID at the place of work. These findings were confirmed in a sensitivity analysis. We also discover heterogeneous effects of food insufficiency, unemployment, and income loss on mental health across different socioeconomic groups. Larger effects were found in mortgage paying-households, among males, and in non-metro areas.

"Shirking, Commuting and Labor Market Outcomes ∗",,"Recent theoretical work has examined the spatial distribution of unemployment using the efficiency wage model as the mechanism by which unemployment arises in the urban economy. This paper extends the standard efficiency wage model in order to allow for behavioral substitution between leisure time at home and effort at work. In equilibrium, residing at a location with a long commute affects the time available for leisure at home and therefore affects the trade-off between effort at work and risk of unemployment. This model implies an empirical relationship between expected commutes and labor market outcomes, which is tested using the metropolitan sample of the American Housing Survey.

In the theoretical section, consumers maximize utility by allocating time between personal time and social interactions within their neighborhood, and the dual of this problem is used to investigate the bidding and sorting of households over racial composition. The models suggests that African-American households may outbid white households to reside in white neighborhoods, and unlike previous models of segregation this model is consistent with either racial segregation or integration. In the empirical analysis, proxy variables are developed for unobservable attributes that enter household preferences based on measures of household outcomes and satisfaction, and then specifies an econometric model of residential location choice using those attributes.

Wage Premia in Employment Clusters: Agglomeration Economies or Worker Heterogeneity?,,"The correlation between wage premia and concentrations of firm activity may arise due to agglomeration economies or workers sorting by unobserved productivity. A worker's residential location is used as a proxy for their unobservable productivity attributes in order to test whether estimated work location wage premia are robust to the inclusion of these controls. Further, in a locational equilibrium, identical workers must receive equivalent compensation so that after controlling for residential location (housing prices) and commutes workers must be paid the same wages and only wage premia arising from unobserved productivity differences should remain unexplained. The models in this paper are estimated using a sample of male workers residing in 33 large metropolitan areas drawn from the 5% Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) from the 2000 U.S. Decennial Census. We find that wages are higher when an individual works in a location that has more workers or a greater density of workers. These agglomeration effects are robust to the inclusion of residential location controls and disappear with the inclusion of commute time suggesting that the effects are not caused by unobserved differences in worker productivity.

"Place, scale and the racial claims made for multiracial children in the 1990 US Census",https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870802021120,"Abstract Abstract Multiracial children embody ambiguities inherent in racial categorization and expose fictions of discrete races. Nevertheless, parents of multiracial children were asked for the 1990 US Census to report a single race for their offspring. Using confidential 1990 Census micro-data, we investigate the choices parents made for the three most common racially mixed household types (Asian-white, black-white and Latino-white) in twelve large metropolitan areas. We find that context affects the reporting of children's racial identity. We examine these effects with models that incorporate three spatial scales: households, neighbourhoods and metropolitan areas. Model estimates reveal that racial claims made by parents of Latino- and Asian-white (but not black-white) children varied significantly across metropolitan area. A neighbourhood's proportion white increased the probability that parents reported their children as white, while a neighbourhood's racial diversity increased the probability that black-white parents claimed a non-white race (black or ‘other’) for their children.

We thank Rebecca Acosta and the California Census Research Data Center for assistance with the data and Serin Houston for her research support and valuable editorial comments. Previous versions of this paper were presented at the Race, Ethnicity and Place Conference, Howard University, September 2004, and at a seminar at the Baldy Center for Law and Social Policy, SUNY Buffalo, November 2004. We thank the Baldy seminar participants for their input and especially Catherine Cornbleth, Amy Kedron, Charles Lamb and Judy Scales-Trent for their commentaries. This paper reports the results of research and analysis undertaken while the authors were conducting a study approved by the Center for Economic Studies at the US Census Bureau. It has undergone a Census Bureau review more limited in scope than that given to official Census Bureau publications. Research results and conclusions expressed are those of the authors and do not necessarily indicate concurrence by the Census Bureau. It has been screened to ensure that no confidential information is revealed. Notes 1. This layering will always be imperfect because, as Goldberg observes, the census form ‘lags behind the complex negotiations of identities and (self-) identifications in everyday experience, even as it serves in part to shape and fix those identities and identifications’ (1997, pp. 32–3). 2. Most US research that measures contextual effects on parents’ racial claims for their children has relied on large geographic units (Public Use Microsample Areas) containing a minimum population of 100,000. Our analysis is the first to use considerably smaller census tracts that contain between 4,000 and 8,000 people, because the Census Bureau provided us with access to confidential information on individuals in households by census tract of residence for the 1990 Census. While considerable debate remains in the social science literature about the most appropriate scale of neighbourhood cartography (e.g. Martin 2003 Martin, D. G. 2003. ‘Enacting neighborhood’. Urban Geography, 24(5): 361–85. [Taylor & Francis Online], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]), and we could have used smaller block groups, census tracts are most suitable for two reasons. One, our broader project engages the existing racial residential segregation literature – a literature that predominantly uses census tracts. Two, despite having access to the full one-in-six sample of long-form respondents, our sample sizes remain small. Census tracts seem to us an appropriate compromise between the detail that a smaller geographic unit might provide and the precedent of previous literature and our data demands. 3. We follow demographic convention in treating all respondents that indicate Latino or Hispanic ancestry as a distinct racial category, regardless of their response to the race question. In so doing we do not assume away the multiple identities subsumed with this meta-category (e.g. those based on national origin, nativity, class and political ideology, among many others). Moreover, we explicitly reject the notion that the terms ‘Latino’ or ‘Hispanic’ mark a meaningful category of ethnic identity. Rather, we see the creation of pan-ethnic Latino/Hispanic identity in the US as a process of racial formation. Also, noting ongoing terminological debates, we use the terms Latino and Hispanic interchangeably. 4. Our larger project includes racial mixing between non-white adults. Because the children from these and other mixed-race pairings were numerically infrequent, we cannot publish such data as we would risk disclosure of information deemed confidential by Census Bureau. 5. Even when women retain the names with which they were born, children still most often carry their father's family name. 6. We assume that parents fill out the census questionnaire in households with young children. 7. We identify mixed-race households as those where the race of the adult male and adult female (where the relationship to the household head is reported as married or partner) differ across the standard race categories used in the 1990 Census (white, black, Asian, Indian, other). We treat all respondents who indicate Latino or Hispanic ancestry as a distinct racial category, regardless of their response to the race question (see note 3 for additional discussion). 8. We configured the sample to mitigate endogeneity between residential location decisions and parents’ views of their children's racial identity. The age restriction improves our assumptions that parents fill out the census form. It also reduces the chance that parents may declare racial identity as children see themselves, which is more likely in older children and reflects non-residential settings. We initially restricted the sample to households that did not move between 1985 and 1990 to eliminate recent residential moves made with children in mind. This restriction, however, removed over two-thirds of the sample. We kept recent movers in the sample and controlled for their residential mobility with a variable in the models. 9. The standard entropy diversity measure for each tract is , where k indexes racial groups, j indexes census tracts and t indexes total tract population. The maximum value of Ej is obtained when tract j's population is evenly divided between the k racial groups. Since the number of racial groups limits the magnitude of the maximum value, we include a scaling constant s so that Ej ranges between 0 and 1. We calculated Ej based on individuals in the six standard racial groups (Latino, white, black, Asian, Native American and other).",2008,2008-07-12,28,"{'Richard Wright', 'Steven R.

The lost publications tend to be higher quality and more basic, whereas the additional patents tend to be lower quality, less general, and more often privately assigned. These federal funding cuts lead to an increase in private funding, which partially compensates for the decline in federal funding.

"Use of Geocoding to Understand Variation in Neighborhood Socioeconomic Status in a Nationwide Occupational Cohort across Time, Space and Demographic Characteristics",https://doi.org/10.1289/isesisee.2018.o03.04.17,"Geocoding has been used in environmental epidemiology to understand geographically patterned exposures but has not been widely applied in occupational studies. We present the feasibility of geocoding a nationwide occupational cohort, the US Radiologic Technologists Study (USRT, N=146,021) to: (1) evaluate geocoding across time, (2) test precision of geocoding by rural (vs. urban) status and by neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES), and (3) explore nSES distribution by some cohort demographic factors. We created a standardized nSES index, based on validated methods, for each census block-group in the US, at 3 time points, using 6 items from the U.S. Census (1990, 2000) and American Community Survey (2010): regionally-adjusted median household income and median housing value, % households with interest/income, % adults who completed high school, % adults who completed college, and % employed persons in managerial occupations. To link nSES to the cohort, we geocoded respondent addresses in 1992, 2003, 2010, to block-group of residence. Over 99% of addresses were geocoded; 76 to 86% were mapped to an address-specific block-group, while the rest were geocoded to a block-group of the zipcode centroid. Urban (vs. rural) addresses and those in the highest (vs. lowest) nSES quintile were more likely to be geocoded to an address-specific block-group (OR=4.6; 95%CI=4.5-4.7 and OR=6.4; 95%CI=6.1-6.7, respectively for 1992 addresses). Results of linear regression show higher nSES in 1990 was associated with USRT participants of female gender (β=0.22; 95%CI=0.20, 0.23), older age (β=0.003; 95%CI=0.002, 0.003), white race (β=0.37; 95%CI=0.35, 0.38) and more recent age-adjusted certification year (β= -0.018; 95%CI= -0.016, -0.019).

Neighborhood Socioeconomic Context and Cognitive Decline Among Older Mexican Americans: Results From the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging,https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwr095,"In 1 previous study, it was shown that neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with cognitive decline among Latinos. No studies have explored whether and to what extent individual-level socioeconomic factors account for the relation between neighborhood disadvantage and cognitive decline. The purpose of the present study was to assess the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic position (SEP) on cognitive decline and examine how individual-level SEP factors (educational level, annual income, and occupation) influenced neighborhood associations over the course of 10 years. Participants (n = 1,789) were community-dwelling older Mexican Americans from the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging. Neighborhood SEP was derived by linking the participant's individual data to the 2000 decennial census. The authors assessed cognitive function with the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination. Analyses used 3-level hierarchical linear mixed models of time within individuals within neighborhoods. After adjustment for individual-level sociodemographic characteristics, higher neighborhood SEP was significantly associated with cognitive function (β = −0.033; P < 0.05) and rates of decline (β = −0.0009; P < 0.10). After adjustment for individual educational level, neighborhood SEP remained associated with baseline cognition but not with rates of decline. Differences in individual educational levels explained most of the intra- and interneighborhood variance. These results suggest that the effect of neighborhood SEP on cognitive decline among Latinos is primarily accounted for by education.",2011,2011-06-29,74,"{'Allison E. Aiello', 'Theresa L.

"Specialization, Firms, and Markets: The Division of Labor within and between Law Firms",https://doi.org/10.1093/jleo/ewn003,"This article uses confidential microdata from the Census of Services to examine law firms' field boundaries. We find that the share of lawyers working in field-specialized firms increases as market size increases and lawyers field specialize, indicating that transaction costs among lawyers, and not just complementarities in clients' demands, affect law firms' field boundaries. Moreover, we find that this pattern is mainly true when looking at fields where lawyers are involved in dispute resolution rather than in structuring transactions. We then analyze which combinations of specialists tend to work in the same firm and which tend not to do so. We relate our results to theories of law firms' boundaries from the organizational economics literature. Our evidence leads us to eliminate risk sharing as an important determinant of firms' field boundaries and narrows the set of possible monitoring or knowledge sharing explanations.

With proxies for both the underlying quality of each business and for the quality of the manager running the business, we are able to begin separating the influences of the manager from that of the underlying business on such factors as business discontinuance and business transfer. An example of the questions we explore is: Holding business quality fixed, what is the impact of the manager on the probability of business discontinuance? Regarding this question, we find that managers have a large impact on the course of their businesses, in particular, among businesses of the same age, managerial tenure has a significant impact on the probability of business discontinuance and transfer.",1992,1992-09-01,7,"{'James A.

Our article addresses this limitation though a case study that compares social inequities in exposure to chronic and acute pollution risks in the Greater Houston Metropolitan Statistical Area, Texas. The study integrates estimates of chronic cancer risk associated with ambient exposure to hazardous air pollutants from the Environmental Protection Agency's National‐Scale Air Toxics Assessment (2005), hazardous chemical accidents from the National Response Center's Emergency Response Notification System (2007–2011), and sociodemographic characteristics from the American Community Survey (2007–2011). Statistical analyses are based on descriptive comparisons, bivariate correlations, and locally derived spatial regression models that account for spatial dependence in the data. Results indicate that neighborhoods with a higher percentage of Hispanic residents, lower percentage of homeowners, and higher income inequality are facing significantly greater exposure to both chronic and acute pollution risks. The non‐Hispanic black percentage is significantly higher in neighborhoods with greater chronic cancer risk, but lower in areas exposed to acute pollution events. Households isolated by language—those highly likely to face evacuation problems during an actual chemical disaster—tend to reside in areas facing significantly greater exposure to high‐impact acute events.

"Sexual Orientation, Gender, and Environmental Injustice: Unequal Carcinogenic Air Pollution Risks in Greater Houston",https://doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2016.1218270,"Disparate residential hazard exposures based on disadvantaged gender status (e.g., among female-headed households) have been documented in the distributive environmental justice literature, yet no published studies have examined whether disproportionate environmental risks exist based on minority sexual orientation. To address this gap, we use data from the US Census, American Community Survey and the Environmental Protection Agency at the 2010 census tract level to examine the spatial relationships between same-sex partner households and cumulative cancer risk from exposure to hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) emitted by all ambient emission sources in Greater Houston (Texas). Findings from generalized estimating equation analyses demonstrate that increased cancer risks from HAPs are significantly associated with neighborhoods having relatively high concentrations of resident same-sex partner households, adjusting for geographic clustering and variables known to influence risk (i.e., race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, renter status, income inequality, and population density). However, HAP exposures are distributed differently for same-sex male versus same-sex female partner households. Neighborhoods with relatively high proportions of same-sex male partner households are associated with significantly greater exposure to cancer-causing HAPs while those with high proportions of same-sex female partner households are associated with less exposure. This study provides initial empirical documentation of a previously unstudied pattern, and infuses current theoretical understanding of environmental inequality formation with knowledge emanating from the sexualities and space literature. Practically, results suggest that other documented health risks experienced in gay neighborhoods may be compounded by disparate health risks associated with harmful exposures to air toxics.",2016,2016-09-30,37,"{'Danielle X.

"Environmental Injustice and Religion: Outdoor Air Pollution Disparities in Metropolitan Salt Lake City, Utah",https://doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2018.1546568,"The distributive environmental justice literature has expanded beyond examining only race- and class-based injustices, but no studies have focused on religion's influence on disparate environmental risks. We address that gap using data from the decennial U.S. Census, American Community Survey, and Environmental Protection Agency for 2010 census tracts to examine a proxy measure of Mormon prevalence, racial and ethnic composition, and socioeconomic status as predictors of seven indicators of outdoor air pollution in metropolitan Salt Lake City, Utah. Results from multivariate generalized estimating equation (GEE) analyses show that greater Mormon prevalence and white composition each independently predict lower levels of air pollution; moreover, Mormon prevalence and whiteness are the strongest predictors in the models. Results also demonstrate that greater proportions of Hispanic, black, and Pacific Islander residents predict higher levels of air pollution, suggesting that systemic white privilege oppresses those groups such that they experience air pollution disparities. Mormons are socially privileged in Salt Lake City, and findings indicate that their collective power serves to protect them from air pollution. Exploratory GEE interaction analyses reveal that disparities in exposure to particulate matter based on higher Hispanic composition are attenuated under conditions of high Mormon prevalence. Findings indicate that white privilege or racial oppression and Mormon privilege operate distinctively and, to a lesser degree, interactively as determinants of distributive environmental injustices in Salt Lake City. Although affiliation with a contextually dominant religion (Mormonism) among residents in Salt Lake City shapes neighborhood patterns of environmental inequality, future studies should examine the role of religion in both producing and ameliorating environmental injustice.

Ancestry-Based Intracategorical Injustices in Carcinogenic Air Pollution Exposures in the United States,https://doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2019.1708521,"Previous studies of US environmental inequalities have focused on racial/ethnic differences in air pollutant exposure. Few have applied an intracategorical framework, which enables the identification of within-group differences through the examination of subgroups. We applied this framework to examine exposure disparities between 26 ancestry/ethnic origin groups within five US racial/ethnic categories. Data came from the US Census, American Community Survey, and National Air Toxics Assessment. We calculated national population-weighted lifetime cancer risk (LCR) scores from residential exposure to hazardous air pollutants.

Homicide and Social Disorganization on the Border: Implications for Latino and Immigrant Populations,https://doi.org/10.1111/ssqu.12051,"Objective We advance social disorganization theory by examining homicides disaggregated by motive and gang relation and by using data from El Paso, Texas—a predominantly Latino city with high levels of immigration and poverty. Methods We analyze homicide data from the El Paso Police Department's detective logs, 1985–1995, as well as data from the 1990 U.S. Decennial Census. Results Key measures of social disorganization tend to be associated with homicide but these relationships vary across type of homicide. Immigration and percent African American show no connection with any homicide measure, while percent Latino is only positively associated with gang‐related homicides. Conclusion Overall, social disorganization is useful in understanding homicide in El Paso, but race/ethnicity and immigration do not operate as predicted. These results add important knowledge to a growing literature regarding the neighborhood‐level associations between immigration, Latinos, and crime.",2013,2013-07-10,21,"{'Theodore R.

Can Economic Deprivation Protect Health? Paradoxical Multilevel Effects of Poverty on Hispanic Children’s Wheezing,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph110807856,"Prior research suggests that economic deprivation has a generally negative influence on residents’ health. We employ hierarchical logistic regression modeling to test if economic deprivation presents respiratory health risks or benefits to Hispanic children living in the City of El Paso (Texas, USA) at neighborhood- and individual-levels, and whether individual-level health effects of economic deprivation vary based on neighborhood-level economic deprivation. Data come from the US Census Bureau and a population-based survey of El Paso schoolchildren. The dependent variable is children’s current wheezing, an established respiratory morbidity measure, which is appropriate for use with economically-deprived children with an increased likelihood of not receiving a doctor’s asthma diagnosis. Results reveal that economic deprivation (measured based on poverty status) at both neighborhood- and individual-levels is associated with reduced odds of wheezing for Hispanic children. A sensitivity analysis revealed similar significant effects of individual- and neighborhood-level poverty on the odds of doctor-diagnosed asthma. Neighborhood-level poverty did not significantly modify the observed association between individual-level poverty and Hispanic children’s wheezing; however, greater neighborhood poverty tends to be more protective for poor (as opposed to non-poor) Hispanic children. These findings support a novel, multilevel understanding of seemingly paradoxical effects of economic deprivation on Hispanic health.",2014,2014-08-06,4,"{'Sara E. Grineski', 'Timothy W.

After a brief introduction to past NCSES efforts measuring innovation, we examine overall innovation patterns of all businesses and then the extent and type of innovative firms with 1 to 9 employees, both based on the 2017 Annual Business Survey (ABS). We provide a quantitative test of the hypotheses that (i) there is a division of ""innovative labor"" - i.e., labor specialized in inventive activity commonly associated with R&D - that concentrates much radical innovation in small firms and (ii) innovation in the services often happens at a much smaller scale than in manufacturing.

Testing biasedness of self-reported microbusiness innovation in the annual business survey,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0296667,"This study tests for potential bias in self-reported innovation due to the inclusion of a research and development (R&amp;D) module that only microbusinesses (less than 10 employees) receive in the Annual Business Survey (ABS). Previous research found that respondents to combined innovation/R&amp;D surveys reported innovation at lower rates than respondents to innovation-only surveys. A regression discontinuity design is used to test whether microbusinesses, which constitute a significant portion of U.S. firms with employees, are less likely to report innovation compared to other small businesses. In the vicinity of the 10-employee threshold, the study does not detect statistically significant biases for new-to-market and new-to-business product innovation. Statistical power analysis confirms the nonexistence of biases with a high power. Comparing the survey design of ABS to earlier combined innovation/R&amp;D surveys provides valuable insights for the proposed integration of multiple Federal surveys into a single enterprise platform survey.

"Changes in Metropolitan Area Definition, 1910-2010",,"The Census Bureau was established as a permanent agency in 1902, as industrialization and urbanization were bringing about rapid changes in American society. The years following the establishment of a permanent Census Bureau saw the first attempts at devising statistical geography for tabulating statistics for large cities and their environs. These efforts faced several challenges owing to the variation in settlement patterns, political organization, and rates of growth across the United States. The 1910 census proved to be a watershed, as the Census Bureau offered a definition of urban places, established the first census tract boundaries for tabulating data within cities, and introduced the first standardized metropolitan area definition. It was not until the middle of the twentieth century, however, the Census Bureau in association with other statistical agencies had established a flexible standard metropolitan definition and a more consistent means of tabulating urban data. Since 1950, the rules for determining the cores and extent of metropolitan areas have been largely regarded as comparable. In the decades that followed, however, a number of rule changes were put into place that accounted for metropolitan complexity in differing ways, and these have been the cause of some confusion. Changes put into effect with the 2000 census represent a consensus of sorts for how to handle these issues.",2021,2021-01-01,1,{'Todd Gardner'},,"Census and Population Estimation; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies",RePEc: Research Papers in Economics,preprint,Todd K Gardner,https://openalex.org/A5054989239,Address Control FIle; Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Minnesota
Potential of Newness: Spatial and Organizational Dynamics of Entrepreneurship,https://doi.org/10.5465/ambpp.2017.13086abstract,"This paper analyzes how entrepreneurs fare in intermediary market segments when the intermediary market segment is closely attached to a single supplier market. While focusing on two structural constraints, organizational and spatial factors, I build off of the fact that in the past thirty years in the U.S. beer industry, as the number of beer producers (i.e. brewers) proliferated, their intermediaries (i.e. wholesalers) declined. Using establishment-level restricted-access economic microdata from the Longitudinal Business Database and the Census of Wholesale Trade, I examine what happens with the intermediaries when (some) producers start competing on product variety instead of competing on scale. I find that Stinchcombe’s ‘liability of newness’ principle can get suspended and certain newcomers have better survival chances than industry incumbents. That is, entrepreneurial establishments fare better if they are part of well-resourced multiunit firms and are entering the market in an area where a large proportion of establishments exited previously. The results highlight how organizational factors and geography create inequalities among intermediary organizations.",2017,2017-08-01,0,{'Tünde Cserpes'},University of Illinois Chicago,Wine Industry and Tourism; Forest Management and Policy; Organic Food and Agriculture,Academy of Management Proceedings,article,Tunde Cserpes,https://openalex.org/A5028061219,Census of Wholesale Trade; Standard Statistical Establishment Listing; Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,Census of Wholesale Trade,Chicago

Costs of Air Quality Regulation,https://doi.org/10.3386/w7308,"This paper explores some costs associated with environmental regulation.We focus on regulation pertaining to ground-level ozone (O 3 ) and its effects on two manufacturing industries --industrial organic chemicals (SIC 2865-9) and miscellaneous plastic products (SIC 308).Both are major emitters of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (No x ), the chemical precursors to ozone.Using plant-level data from the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Research Database (LRD), we examine the effects of regulation on the timing and magnitudes of investments by firms and on the impact it has had on their operating costs.As an alternative way to assess costs, we also employ plant-level data from the Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures (PACE) survey.Analyses employing average total cost functions reveal that plants' production costs are indeed higher in (heavily-regulated) non-attainment areas relative to (less-regulated) attainment areas.This is particularly true for younger plants, consistent with the notion that regulation is most burdensome for new (rather than existing) plants.Cost estimates using PACE data generally reveal lower costs.We also find that new heavily-regulated plants start our much larger than less-regulated plants, but then do not invest as much.Among other things, this highlights the substantial fixed costs involved in obtaining expansion permits.We also discuss reasons why plants may restrict their size.",1999,1999-08-01,44,"{'J.

What do Unions do? Incentives and Investments,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4565288,"Using plant-level data from the Census Bureau, we show that in addition to paying higher wages and benefits, unionized plants have lower and less effective incentives. Unionized plants do not exhibit the same positive associations between incentives and investment and growth found in non-unionized plants. This effect holds among both non-managerial and managerial employees, although it has a more pronounced influence on the former group. Consequently, unionized plants experience higher rates of closure, reduced investment, and slower employment growth. We also find significant spillover effects within the firm: partially unionized firms not only offer higher wages but also maintain weaker incentives in their non-unionized plants compared to their industry peers. These effects are economically significant and are half of our estimated reduction in incentives in unionized plants. This pattern aligns with the hypothesis that incentives in non-unionized plants create disutility for the median worker. Spillovers reduce employment and efficiency and make firms less attractive as potential targets, thus reducing the market’s effectiveness in allocating corporate assets.

Regional and Metropolitan Growth and Decline in the United States,https://doi.org/10.2307/143480,This volume is 1 of a series aimed at converting the vast statistical yield of the 1980 US census into authoritative analyses of major trends and changes in American life. This volumes main objective is to interpret the redistribution patterns of the 1970s and early 1980s in light of the changing social and economic contexts for redistribution that emerged during this period taking cognizance of the major explanations and theories that have been offered to account for these new patterns. Part 1 comprising chapters 3-6 pertains to redistribution across regions and metropolitan areas. This portion of the monograph provides an overview of the new regional and metropolitan area redistribution patterns by evaluating the pervasiveness of the post-1970 redistribution reversals as well as shifts in the demographic components of change that underlie them. It examines the impact of 1970-1980 growth and decline on population and household subgroups in various areas and undertakes a separate examination of redistribution patterns determinants and consequences for the black population. Part 2 of this monograph comprising chapters 7-11 evaluates post-1970 shifts in central city-suburban redistribution within the nations 39 largest metropolitan areas. It also documents aggregate population changes for central cities and suburbs along with their underlying demographic components. It devotes the most attention to shifts in the racial and socioeconomic selectivities that have become associated with post-1970 suburbanization and their impacts on the central city. It provides careful evaluation of selective post-1970 city-suburb redistribution tendencies with the aid of rich area-based summary data from the 1970 and 1980 decennial censuses. It evaluates the extent to which the 1970s shifts in racial segregation the decline of full-family households and the rise of the so-called service city have effected beneficial demographic changes in large central cities. The final chapter ties together this studys major results and underlying perspectives. It reviews the most important influences on redistribution in the post-1970 period and speculates about future redistribution tendencies that could emerge.,1989,1989-01-01,126,"{'William H.

Migration and Dispersal of Hispanic and Asian Groups: An Analysis of the 2006-2008 Multiyear American Community Survey,,"This report seeks to evaluate selective migration processes of Hispanic and Asian nationality groups in the US from established settlement areas, using recent migration data from the American Community Survey. The underlying goal is to detect migration tendencies leading toward an increased dispersion of these groups associated with their migration processes. Using descriptive statistics, maps, and migration models, we assess how migration processes in the 2006-8 period are leading to the dispersal of Hispanic and Asian race ethnic groups across metropolitan areas, with special attention to the roles of co-ethnic communities and spatial assimilation. These analyses employ migration data available from the 3-year 2006-8 American Community Survey using restricted data from the US Census Bureau’s Research Data Centers. This use of the restricted ACS files permitted the first post 2000 analysis of inter-metropolitan migration for Hispanic groups (Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Salvadorans, Dominicans) and Asian groups (Chinese, Indians, Filipinos, Vietnamese, Koreans) using the detailed demographic and geographic attributes available with these files. The data and analysis presented here provide a benchmark for further research of this kind with the American Community Survey in light of the fact that migration data will no longer be available from the US decennial census. The study examines migration from these groups’ major settlement areas to other metropolitan area destinations as they are affected by the attraction of co-ethnic communities and by a migrant selectivity pattern consistent with the perspective of spatial assimilation. The migration processes themselves were evaluated in terms of two components: the out--migration rates of residents, and the destination selection of movers. From the perspective of co-ethnic community attraction, it was hypothesized that the outmigration rates from high co-ethnic settlement areas would be lower than those from areas where the group had a smaller overall presence and that the destination selections of out-migrants would be positively affected by the presence of high co-ethnic population shares in destination areas. From the spatial assimilation perspective, it was hypothesized that out-migration from high coethnic areas would least likely occur for group members with lowest education, poor facility with English, and recently arrived in the US; whereas the selection of destinations with large coethnic population shares would be most likely to occur for these same population categories. The results strongly confirm that co-ethnic community attraction continues to reduce outmigration of groups from major settlement origins and positively influences their destination selections. A series of multivariate migrant destination selection models confirm a consistent draw of ethnically similar destinations across individual Hispanic and Asian groups when other economic, demographic and structural metropolitan attributes are taken into account. In contrast, results regarding spatial assimilation are typically mixed or nonexistent in characterizing both out-migration and mover destination selectivity patterns. In fact, we find contrary evidence for some Asian groups for whom it is the most educated, and native born migrants who show a penchant for selecting destinations with greater co-ethnic population shares. Among the greatest destinations for Indians, for example, are Philadelphia, Seattle, Dallas, Boston and Atlanta- areas with higher than average Indian population shares, and areas that also house knowledge-based industries. The selection of co-ethnic destinations among Hispanic group migrants appears somewhat impervious to education attainment and Hispanic and Mexican group movers, who are foreign born and who arrived since 2000, are least, rather than most, prone to select co-ethnic destinations. The mover destination models make plain that employment growth at destination provides a strong draw for all Hispanic groups. This suggests that recent growth in low skilled jobs in parts of the country with small Hispanic populations are nonetheless attracting newly arrived, and less skilled Mexicans and other Hispanics who might have previously been especially lured to destinations with large co-ethnic population shares.",2010,2010-01-01,1,"{'William H.

La diversificación de la población de Estados Unidos,,"Mientras los estadounidenses se preparan para elegir a su nuevo presidente el 3 de noviembre, la situacion en el pais ha sido particularmente tensa durante varios meses con el resurgimiento del movimiento Black Lives Matter (Las Vidas de los Negros Cuentan) ha ido en aumento. Varias muertes controvertidas de estadounidenses de raza negra durante detenciones policiales han dado lugar a una serie de manifestaciones y disturbios desde la primavera de 2020 que denuncian la persistencia del racismo en las fuerzas del orden, si no en la sociedad estadounidense en su conjunto. Como pais del melting-pot, Estados Unidos busca a trompicones el camino de las relaciones sociales pacificas entre las diferentes comunidades etnicas que componen su poblacion. Sin embargo, a la luz de las ultimas conclusiones del censo de 2020, se esta haciendo mas que necesario que trabaje en pro de esa cohesion social: por primera vez en su historia, durante el segundo decenio del siglo XXI la poblacion de raza blanca de Estados Unidos disminuyo en numero, y el crecimiento general de la poblacion del pais se basa ahora principalmente en el de las minorias etnicas. William H. Frey presenta esta aceleracion de la tendencia a la diversificacion de la poblacion de Estados Unidos basandose en los ultimos datos publicados por el Census Bureau (Oficina del Censo).

The Great Recession and a Missing Generation of Exporters,https://doi.org/10.17016/feds.2017.108,"The collapse of international trade surrounding the Great Recession has garnered significant attention. This paper studies firm entry and exit in foreign markets and their role in the post-recession recovery of U.S. exports using confidential microdata from the U.S. Census Bureau. We find that incumbent exporters account for the vast majority of the decline in export volumes during the crisis. The recession also induced a missing generation of exporters, with large increases in exits and a substantial decline in entries into foreign markets. New exporters during these years tended to have larger export volumes, however, compensating for the decline in the number of exporting firms. Thus, while entry and exit were important for determining the variety of U.S. goods that were exported, they were less important for the trajectory of aggregate foreign sales.",2017,2017-11-01,3,"{'Andrew H.

Immigrant Entrepreneurship in America: Evidence from the Survey of Business Owners 2007 & 2012,,"We study immigrant entrepreneurship and firm ownership in 2007 and 2012 using the Survey of Business Owners (SBO). The survival and growth of immigrant-owned businesses over time relative to native-founded companies is evaluated by linking the 2007 SBO to the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD). We quantify the dependency of the United States as a whole, as well as individual states, on the contributions of immigrant entrepreneurs in terms of firm formation and job creation. We describe differences in the types of businesses started by immigrants and the quality of jobs created by their firms. First-generation immigrants create about 25% of new firms in the United States, but this share exceeds 40% in some states. In addition, Asian and Hispanic second-generation immigrants start about 6% of new firms. Immigrant-owned firms, on average, create fewer jobs than native-owned firms, but much of this is explained by the industry and geographic location of the firms.

"High-Skilled Immigration, Domestic Innovation, and Global Exchanges",,"High-skilled immigrants account for about 25 percent of the workers in the most innovative and entrepreneurial U.S. industries, and they are responsible for a roughly similar share of out-put measures like patents or firm starts. Immigrants have also accounted for the majority of the growth in the U.S. scientific workforce since the 1990s. The magnitudes of these contributions make understanding the economic consequences of immigration an important research priority. In this piece, I summarize the major themes that have emerged from my work on high-skilled immigration. I start by describing the construction of the ethnic patenting records that I use in most of my studies. I then outline projects that have considered the economic consequences of high-skilled immigrants for the United States. The last part of this research summary focuses on the outbound economic consequences of high-skilled emigration for the home countries of those who move to the United States. Developing Data While the substantial role of immigrants in U.S. technological development has long been recognized, data constraints have posed a significant challenge for research. Some datasets, like the decennial Censuses, provide rich cross-sectional accounts but limited longitudinal variation. Others, such as the Current Population Survey, provide better longitudinal detail but less cross-sectional heterogeneity. Moreover, it has been especially difficult to collect data on the role of high-skilled immigrants in research-oriented firms and universities. Most of my work on high-skilled immigrants builds off the assignment of probable ethnicities to individuals who appear in U.S. patent records. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) publishes all the patents it grants, which have exceeded 200,000 grants in recent years. Every patent must list at least one inventor, and patents are allowed multiple inventors. Several features of patent litigation make it advisable to correctly list the identities of those truly doing the innovative work when filing for a patent, and through the assignment of patents, this inventor role can be separated from ownership of the property rights to the patent. I use the names of inventors to assign their probable ethnicities. This procedure exploits the fact that individuals with surnames of Gupta or Desai are likely to be Indian, Wang or Ming are likely to be Chinese, and Martinez or Rodriguez are likely to be Hispanic. Name matching procedures have been developed to provide probabilistic ethnicities for virtually all inventors in the USPTO system. The name approach is comparatively stronger at separating among Asian ethnic groups than among European or Hispanic names. This approach does not isolate immigration status directly for multiple reasons, but it does provide an indirect measure that proves useful in research. The appeal of this approach is that it permits assignment of ethnicities to individual patent records. With this granularity, the USPTO records can be aggregated in many ways, for example by year, by city, by very detailed technology codes, and by institution. Moreover, the patent data include a wealth of information, so one can, for example, study citations that patents make to other patents for evidence of ethnic networks in knowledge flow. One can also use measures developed in the technological change literature (such as patent originality scores) to compare inventor contributions across ethnicities. Figure 1 shows the tremendous increase in the ethnic contribution of U.S. inventors over the last 30 years, focusing only on inventors residing in the United States at the time of their work. The contribution of Chinese and Indian ethnic inventors displays exceptional growth, increasing from under 2 percent each to 9 percent and 6 percent respectively. Ethnic contributions are disproportionately concentrated in high-tech fields, and Figure 2 shows the Chinese and Indian inventor shares for several noteworthy companies. …",2013,2013-12-22,3,{'William R.

Immigration and Employer Transitions for STEM Workers,https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.103.3.193,"The firm is almost entirely absent from models of immigration, and yet firms play a central role for high-skilled immigration. The H-1B visa program, for example, is a firm-sponsored entry where firms are responsible for every stage: from identifying the immigrant, to employing them, to filing for permanent residency on behalf of the immigrant. This central role of firms for high-skilled immigration suggests the traditional lens for evaluating the impact of immigration on natives through local area labor markets or national age-education approaches may miss important dynamics. We analyze the employment and wage trajectories of high-skilled workers born in America when a high-skilled immigrant arrives at their work site. We use linked employer-employee data during the 1995-2008 period from the Census Bureau for this exercise, which identifies the immigration status and country-of-birth of workers. We follow the subsequent career path of workers after high-skilled immigration occurs to the employee's work site both within firms (e.g., changes in employee salary, relocation to other sites) and across firms (e.g., movements to new jobs or out of workforce, long-term salary adjustments). The richness and depth of the Census Bureau data allow for multiple comparison points: selection on observables (e.g., age, tenure, salary levels and recent growth), varying immigration treatments across different work sites for the same firm for otherwise comparable employees, and (for a subset of cases and short time period at the end of our sample) randomization in H-1B admission lotteries.",2013,2013-05-01,34,"{'William R.

"""Public Vs. Private Firms: Energy Efficiency, Toxic Emissions And Abatement Spending""",https://doi.org/10.5465/ambpp.2015.15486abstract,"In this paper, we examine the effect of ownership status on three environmentally relevant variables: energy efficiency, toxic emissions and spending on pollution abatement. Prior research has demonstrated that public firms invest less than private firms and suggests this difference in investment behavior is due to ‘short-termism’ - pressure from capital markets to strongly favor short over long term earnings. We extend this logic to other firm behavior, examining whether publicly owned plants invest in energy efficiency and pollution reduction differently than privately owned plants. Using data from the US Census of Manufactures from 1980-2009, linked with information on pollution from the EPA Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) and pollution abatement spending from the PACE survey, we find some evidence that publicly owned plants are less energy efficient, release more toxic emissions and spend less on pollution abatement than their privately owned counterparts. We also examine how different sources of external pressures alter these results and find that increased regulatory scrutiny is correlated with increased energy efficiency, toxic emissions and abatement spending. More concentrated institutional ownership in public firms is associated with lower energy efficiency as is a greater brand focus. These latter results are broadly consistent with the idea that publicly owned firms respond to pressures from capital markets with a reduced focus on environmentally relevant variables.",2015,2015-01-01,0,"{'Rachelle C.

"Professional Employer Organizations: What Are They, Who Uses Them, and Why Should We Care?",,"Introduction and summary A growing number of U.S. workers are counted as of firms that they do not actually work for. Some of these workers are from temporary help services (THS) agencies and some are employees, who are on the payrolls of professional employer organizations (PEOs) but work for PEOs' client firms. Several studies have looked at firms' use of THS, but few have examined the use of PEO services. In this article, we use data from the U.S. Census Bureau to shed some light on PEOs--how they operate, what types of companies employ them, and why. PEOs provide various services related to human resources (HR) management, such as payroll processing, benefit management, and regulation compliance. Unlike consultant firms that only provide recommendations on these functions, PEOs operate in a co-employment relationship with their clients, by including the clients' workers on their own payrolls. In such a relationship, PEOs become employers of record for tax and insurance purposes. PEOs exercise some decision-making in HR management; at the same time, they share legal responsibilities as co-employers. By pooling the workers of its clients on its payroll, a PEO gains economies of scale in performing its required tasks. The workers whose payrolls are moved to PEOs are often referred to as leased employees because, on paper, they work for the PEO and are back to the client firm. Since are not accounted for on clients' payrolls, the payroll-based labor statistics underestimate labor used by the industries of PEO client firms. In the 2002 Economic Census's subject series on Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services, (1) the PEO industry consisted of about 5,000 establishments. It employed 1.7 million employees. The PEO industry achieved rapid growth through the 1990s, with a growth rate of 386 percent from 1992 to 2002, subtracting an increasing number of workers from the payroll records of other industries. (2) In this article, we first review the history and current nature of PEO services. Next, we use publicly available data to show that the distribution of the use of PEO services is not uniform across industries or geographical areas. We then use confidential microdata from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2002 Census of Manufactures to examine how characteristics other than location and industry may influence companies' use of PEO services and, therefore, why certain types of companies are more likely to use PEO services than others. This also sheds some light on the issues researchers face in interpreting payroll-based labor statistics. Dey, Houseman, and Polivka (2006) provide a review of the issues related to payroll-based labor statistics. They also assess the effect of firms' use of employment services as a whole, including PEO services and THS, focusing on the manufacturing sector. Between 1989 and 2000, employment in manufacturing reportedly fell by 4.1 percent. Dey, Houseman, and Polivka (2006) show, however, that manufacturing employment would have actually increased by 1.4 percent if employment services workers had been included. (3) They also estimate that the use of these employment services added 0.5 percentage points to the annual growth rate of labor productivity as measured by output per worker in the manufacturing sector between 1989 and 2000, equaling approximately 14 percent of the overall growth. (4) Houseman (2006) also shows that the multifactor productivity measure for manufacturing would also overestimate productivity growth as the data do not allow us to fully capture employment services input to manufacturing. The existing literature (Houseman, 2006; Estavao and Lach, 1999; and Segal and Sullivan, 1997) relies mostly on data on firms' use of THS industries, partly reflecting data availability. We complement this literature here by examining firms' use of PEOs. History and activities of PEOs PEOs started out in the early 1980s, conducting payroll processing for client firms. …",2008,2008-12-22,6,"{'Yukako Ono', 'Britton Lombardi'}",,"Retirement, Disability, and Employment; Employment and Welfare Studies; Polish Legal and Social Issues",Economic Perspectives,article,Yukako Ono,https://openalex.org/A5102320047,Census of Services; Census of Manufactures; Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,Census of Manufactures,Boston

Outsourcing Business Service and the Scope of Local Markets,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.285771,"This paper examines outsourcing to test whether productivity-enhancing specialization is facilitated in bigger cities. First, the paper provides a theoretical model which shows that greater local demand for a given input promotes the entry of suppliers into a city; the increased number of suppliers then results in lower outsourcing prices and a higher use of outsourcing by final producers, therefore reducing the final producers' production costs. I then test the predictions of the model by examining manufacturing plants' practices of outsourcing business services, by using plant-level data from the 1992 Annual Survey of Manufactures. The empirical results show that an exogenous increase in local demand promotes the entry of service suppliers and increases a firm's probability of outsourcing for white-collar services. In particular, I found that doubling the intensity of the use of a service in a U.S. county, which can be attributed to the industrial composition of the county, results in a 7% to 25% increase in the probability of outsourcing.",2001,2001-01-01,32,{'Yukako Ono'},Federal Reserve,Regional Economics and Spatial Analysis; Global trade and economics; Fiscal Policy and Economic Growth,SSRN Electronic Journal,article,Yukako Ono,https://openalex.org/A5102320047,Annual Survey of Manufactures; Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200; Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,Annual Survey of Manufactures,Boston
Outsourcing business services and the role of central administrative offices,,"In this paper, I study whether there is any evidence that the market scale surrounding a central administrative office (CAO), which includes corporate headquarters, influences a firm's cost-effectiveness in procuring business services. By linking plant-level data from the 1992 Annual Survey of Manufactures with CAO information from the Survey of Auxiliary Establishments, I examine manufacturing plants' practice of outsourcing services in relation to the size of the local service market surrounding the plant and that surrounding the plant's CAO. I found statistically significant evidence that the greater the size of local market surrounding a CAO, the higher the plant's probability of relying on the CAO for outsourcing advertising, bookkeeping and accounting, and legal services. These results are found even after controlling for the size of the local market surrounding a plant and plant characteristics.",2002,2002-01-01,2,{'Yukako Ono'},Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago,Outsourcing and Supply Chain Management,RePEc: Research Papers in Economics,preprint,Yukako Ono,https://openalex.org/A5102320047,Annual Survey of Manufactures; Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200; Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,Annual Survey of Manufactures,Boston

It is therefore surprising that young men are evaluated for testosterone deficiency with the same cutoff of 300 ng/dL that was developed from samples of older men. Our aim is to describe normative total testosterone levels and age-specific cutoffs for low testosterone levels in men 20 to 44 years old. Materials and Methods: We analyzed the 2011-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, which survey nationally representative samples of United States residents. Men 20 to 44 years old with testosterone levels were included. Men on hormonal medications, with a history of testicular cancer or orchiectomy, and with afternoon/evening laboratory values were excluded. We separated men into 5-year intervals and evaluated the testosterone levels of each age group, and for all men 20 to 44 years old. We used the American Urological Association definition of a “normal testosterone level” (the “middle tertile”) to calculate age-specific cutoffs for low testosterone levels. Results: Our final analytic cohort contained 1,486 men. Age-specific middle tertile levels were 409-558 ng/dL (20-24 years old), 413-575 ng/dL (25-29 years old), 359-498 ng/dL (30-34 years old), 352-478 ng/dL (35-39 years old), and 350-473 ng/dL (40-44 years old). Age-specific cutoffs for low testosterone levels were 409, 413, 359, 352, and 350 ng/dL, respectively. Conclusions: Diagnosis of testosterone deficiency has traditionally been performed in an age-indiscriminate manner. However, young men have different testosterone reference ranges than older men. Accordingly, age-specific normative values and cutoffs should be integrated into the evaluation of young men presenting with testosterone deficiency. References 1. . Male hypogonadism.

Dispersion in Dispersion: Measuring Establishment-Level Differences in Productivity,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3870190,"We describe new experimental productivity statistics, Dispersion Statistics on Productivity (DiSP), jointly developed and published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Census Bureau. Official BLS productivity statistics provide information on aggregate productivity growth. Yet, a large body of research shows that within-industry variation in productivity provides important insights into productivity dynamics. This research reveals large and persistent productivity differences across businesses, even within narrowly defined industries. These differences vary by industry and time and are related to productivityenhancing reallocation. Dispersion in productivity across businesses can provide information about the nature of competition and frictions within sectors, and about the sources of rising wage inequality across businesses. Because there were no official statistics providing this level of detail, BLS and the Census Bureau partnered to create measures of within-industry productivity dispersion. These measures complement official BLS aggregate industry-level productivity growth statistics and thereby improve our understanding of the rich productivity dynamics in the U.S. economy. The microdata underlying DiSP are available for use by qualified researchers on approved projects in the Federal Statistical Research Data Center network. DiSP confirms the presence of large productivity differences, and we hope that it will encourage further research into understanding these differences.",2021,2021-01-01,9,"{'Cindy Cunningham', 'Cheryl Grim', 'Zoltán Wolf', 'Lucia Foster', 'Sabrina Wulff Pabilonia', 'Jay M.

Dispersion in Dispersion: Measuring Establishment‐Level Differences in Productivity,https://doi.org/10.1111/roiw.12616,"Abstract We describe new experimental productivity dispersion statistics, Dispersion Statistics on Productivity (DiSP), jointly produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Census Bureau, that complement the official BLS industry‐level productivity statistics. The BLS has a long history of producing industry‐level productivity statistics, which represent the average establishment‐level productivity within industries when appropriately weighted. These statistics cannot, however, tell us about the variation in productivity levels across establishments within those industries. Dispersion in productivity across businesses can provide information about the nature of competition and frictions within sectors and the sources of rising wage inequality across businesses. DiSP data show enormous differences in productivity across establishments within industries in the manufacturing sector. We find substantial variation in dispersion across industries, increasing dispersion from 1997 to 2016, and countercyclical total factor productivity dispersion. We hope DiSP will enable further research into understanding productivity differences across industries and establishments and over time.",2022,2022-09-26,12,"{'Cindy Cunningham', 'Cheryl Grim', 'Zoltán Wolf', 'Jay Stewart', 'Lucia Foster', 'Sabrina Wulff Pabilonia', 'John Haltiwanger'}",Bureau of Labor Statistics; United States Census Bureau; United States Census Bureau; Bureau of Labor Statistics; Bureau of Labor Statistics; New Light Industries (United States),Firm Innovation and Growth; Global trade and economics; Regional Economics and Spatial Analysis,Review of Income and Wealth,article,Zoltan Wolf,https://openalex.org/A5008460009,Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization; Service Annual Survey; Foreign Trade Data - Import; Census Bureau,Census Bureau,Fed Board
