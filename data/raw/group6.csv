"phyloseq: An R Package for Reproducible Interactive Analysis and Graphics of Microbiome Census Data","Background The analysis of microbial communities through DNA sequencing brings many challenges: the integration of different types of data with methods from ecology, genetics, phylogenetics, multivariate statistics, visualization and testing. With the increased breadth of experimental designs now being pursued, project-specific statistical analyses are often needed, and these analyses are often difficult (or impossible) for peer researchers to independently reproduce. The vast majority of the requisite tools for performing these analyses reproducibly are already implemented in R and its extensions (packages), but with limited support for high throughput microbiome census data. Results Here we describe a software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the object-oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census data in R. It supports importing data from a variety of common formats, as well as many analysis techniques. These include calibration, filtering, subsetting, agglomeration, multi-table comparisons, diversity analysis, parallelized Fast UniFrac, ordination methods, and production of publication-quality graphics; all in a manner that is easy to document, share, and modify. We show how to apply functions from other R packages to phyloseq-represented data, illustrating the availability of a large number of open source analysis techniques. We discuss the use of phyloseq with tools for reproducible research, a practice common in other fields but still rare in the analysis of highly parallel microbiome census data. We have made available all of the materials necessary to completely reproduce the analysis and figures included in this article, an example of best practices for reproducible research. Conclusions The phyloseq project for R is a new open-source software package, freely available on the web from both GitHub and Bioconductor.","10.1371/journal.pone.0061217","2.0","Paul J.

"Sociodemographic Characteristics of Members of a Large, Integrated Health Care System: Comparison with US Census Bureau Data","Background: Data from the memberships of large, integrated health care systems can be valuable for clinical, epidemiologic, and health services research, but a potential selection bias may threaten the inference to the population of interest.Methods: We reviewed administrative records of members of Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) in 2000 and 2010, and we compared their sociodemographic characteristics with those of the underlying population in the coverage area on the basis of US Census Bureau data.Results: We identified 3,328,579 KPSC members in 2000 and 3,357,959 KPSC members in 2010, representing approximately 16% of the population in the coverage area.The distribution of sex and age of KPSC members appeared to be similar to the census reference population in 2000 and 2010 except with a slightly higher proportion of 40 to 64 year olds.The proportion of Hispanics/Latinos was comparable between KPSC and the census reference population (37.5% vs 38.2%, respectively, in 2000 and 45.2% vs 43.3% in 2010).However, KPSC members included more blacks (14.9% vs 7.0% in 2000 and 10.8% vs 6.5% in 2010).Neighborhood educational levels and neighborhood household incomes were generally similar between KPSC members and the census reference population, but with a marginal underrepresentation of individuals with extremely low income and high education.Conclusions: The membership of KPSC reflects the socioeconomic diversity of the Southern California census population, suggesting that findings from this setting may provide valid inference for clinical, epidemiologic, and health services research.","10.7812/tpp/12-031","8.0","Corinna Koebnick; Annette Langer‐Gould; Michael K.

"The U.S. Census Bureau Adopts Differential Privacy","The U.S. Census Bureau announced, via its Scientific Advisory Committee, that it would protect the publications of the 2018 End-to-End Census Test (E2E) using differential privacy. The E2E test is a dress rehearsal for the 2020 Census, the constitutionally mandated enumeration of the population used to reapportion the House of Representatives and redraw every legislative district in the country. Systems that perform successfully in the E2E test are then used in the production of the 2020 Census. Motivation: The Census Bureau conducted internal research that confirmed that the statistical disclosure limitation systems used for the 2000 and 2010 Censuses had serious vulnerabilities that were exposed by the Dinur and Nissim (2003) database reconstruction theorem. We designed a differentially private publication system that directly addressed these vulnerabilities while preserving the fitness for use of the core statistical products.","10.1145/3219819.3226070","1.0","John M.

"U.S. Census Bureau‐assessed prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in 2019 and during the 2020 COVID‐19 pandemic","The disruptions to daily life caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have impacted mental health, particularly mood disorders. This study aimed to compare prevalence rates of anxiety disorder and depressive disorder in national samples in the U.S. before and during the pandemic.Participants (n = 336,525) were from U.S. Census Bureau-administered nationally representative probability samples, one from the first half of 2019 and four during the pandemic in April and May 2020. All participants completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 screening for depressive disorder and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 screening for anxiety disorders.Compared to U.S. adults in 2019, U.S. adults in April and May 2020 were more than three times as likely to screen positive for depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, or one or both, with more than one out of three screening positive for one or both. The prevalence of anxiety decreased slightly between the April 23-May 4, 2020 and the May 21-26, 2020 administrations, while the prevalence of depression increased slightly.U.S. adults in 2020 are considerably more likely to screen positive for mood disorders than in 2019, with anxiety declining and depression increasing from April to May.","10.1002/da.23077","2.0","Jean M.

"Ecological Census Techniques","This is an updated version of the best selling first edition, Ecological Census Techniques, with updating, some new chapters and authors. Almost all ecological and conservation work involves carrying out a census or survey. This practically focussed book describes how to plan a census, the practical details and shows with worked examples how to analyse the results. The first three chapters describe planning, sampling and the basic theory necessary for carrying out a census. In the subsequent chapters international experts describe the appropriate methods for counting plants, insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds. As many censuses also relate the results to environmental variability, there is a chapter explaining the main methods. Finally, there is a list of the most common mistakes encountered when carrying out a census.","10.1017/cbo9780511790508","14.0","William J. Sutherland; William J. Sutherland; William J.

"IRS-1-Mediated Inhibition of Insulin Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Activity in TNF-α- and Obesity-Induced Insulin Resistance","Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is an important mediator of insulin resistance in obesity and diabetes through its ability to decrease the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor (IR). Treatment of cultured murine adipocytes with TNF-α was shown to induce serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and convert IRS-1 into an inhibitor of the IR tyrosine kinase activity in vitro. Myeloid 32D cells, which lack endogenous IRS-1, were resistant to TNF-α-mediated inhibition of IR signaling, whereas transfected 32D cells that express IRS-1 were very sensitive to this effect of TNF-α. An inhibitory form of IRS-1 was observed in muscle and fat tissues from obese rats. These results indicate that TNF-α induces insulin resistance through an unexpected action of IRS-1 to attenuate insulin receptor signaling.","10.1126/science.271.5249.665","6.0","Gökhan S.

"Reconciling the Old and New Census Bureau Education Questions: Recommendations for Researchers","Abstract Beginning with the 1990 Census and the January 1992 Current Population Survey (CPS), the Bureau of the Census changed the emphasis of its educational-attainment question from years of education to degree receipt. Using a matched sample from the 1991 and 1992 March CPS, this article addresses how to reconcile the old and new questions. The effects of those methods on the estimated return(s) to education are then examined. Both the estimated linear return and the estimated college–high-school wage differential are slightly larger using information from the new question.

"IRS proteins and the common path to diabetes","Although a full understanding of insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) action is evolving, the discovery of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins and their role to link cell surface receptors to the intracellular signaling cascades provided an important step forward. Moreover, Insulin/IGF receptors use common signaling pathways to accomplish many tasks, the IRS proteins add a unique layer of specificity and control. Importantly, the IRS-2 branch of the insulin/IGF-signaling pathway is a common element in peripheral insulin response and pancreatic beta-cell growth and function. Failure of IRS-2 signaling might explain the eventual loss of compensatory hyperinsulinemia during prolonged periods of peripheral insulin resistance. Moreover, short-term inhibition of IRS protein functions by serine phosphorylation, or sustained inhibition by ubiquitin-targeted proteosome-mediated degradation suggests a common molecular mechanism for insulin resistance during acute injury or infection, or the sensitivity of beta-cells to autoimmune destruction. The broad role of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in cell growth and survival reveals a common regulatory pathway linking development, somatic growth, fertility, neuronal proliferation, and aging to the core mechanisms used by vertebrates for nutrient sensing.","10.1152/ajpendo.00514.2001","1.0","Morris F.

"Overcoming the absence of socioeconomic data in medical records: validation and application of a census-based methodology.","Most US medical records lack socioeconomic data, hindering studies of social gradients in health and ascertainment of whether study samples are representative of the general population. This study assessed the validity of a census-based approach in addressing these problems.Socioeconomic data from 1980 census tracts and block groups were matched to the 1985 membership records of a large prepaid health plan (n = 1.9 million), with the link provided by each individual's residential address. Among a subset of 14,420 Black and White members, comparisons were made of the association of individual, census tract, and census block-group socioeconomic measures with hypertension, height, smoking, and reproductive history.Census-level and individual-level socioeconomic measures were similarly associated with the selected health outcomes. Census data permitted assessing response bias due to missing individual-level socioeconomic data and also contextual effects involving the interaction of individual- and neighborhood-level socioeconomic traits. On the basis of block-group characteristics, health plan members generally were representative of the total population; persons in impoverished neighborhoods, however, were underrepresented.This census-based methodology offers a valid and useful approach to overcoming the absence of socioeconomic data in most US medical records.","10.2105/ajph.82.5.703","1.0","Nancy Krieger","1992.0","","","absence; records; validation; census; methodology"
"Advances in Record-Linkage Methodology as Applied to Matching the 1985 Census of Tampa, Florida","Abstract A test census of Tampa, Florida and an independent postenumeration survey (PES) were conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau in 1985. The PES was a stratified block sample with heavy emphasis placed on hard-to-count population groups. Matching the individuals in the census to the individuals in the PES is an important aspect of census coverage evaluation and consequently a very important process for any census adjustment operations that might be planned. For such an adjustment to be feasible, record-linkage software had to be developed that could perform matches with a high degree of accuracy and that was based on an underlying mathematical theory. A principal purpose of the PES was to provide an opportunity to evaluate the newly implemented record-linkage system and associated methodology. This article discusses the theoretical and practical issues encountered in conducting the matching operation and presents the results of that operation. A review of the theoretical background of the record-linkage problem provides a framework for discussions of the decision procedure, file blocking, and the independence assumption. The estimation of the parameters required by the decision procedure is an important aspect of the methodology, and the techniques presented provide a practical system that is easily implemented. The matching algorithm (discussed in detail) uses the linear sum assignment model to ""pair"" the records. The Tampa, Florida, matching methodology is described in the final sections of the article. Included in the discussion are the results of the matching itself, an independent clerical review of the matches and nonmatches, conclusions, problem areas, and future work required.

"A [ITAL]Hipparcos[/ITAL] Census of the Nearby OB Associations","A comprehensive census of the stellar content of the nearby OB associations is presented, based on Hipparcos positions, proper motions, and parallaxes. Moving groups are identified by combining de Bruijne's refurbished convergent point method with the `Spaghetti method' of Hoogerwerf &amp; Aguilar. Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate the expected number of interloper field stars. Astrometric members are listed for 12 young stellar groups, out to a distance of ~650 pc. These are the 3 subgroups Upper Scorpius, Upper Centaurus Lupus and Lower Centaurus Crux of Sco OB2, as well as Vel OB2, Tr 10, Col 121, Per OB2, alpha Persei (Per OB3), Cas-Tau, Lac OB1, Cep OB2, and a new group designated as Cep OB6. The selection procedure corrects the list of previously known astrometric and photometric B- and A-type members, and identifies many new members, including a significant number of F stars, as well as evolved stars, e.g., the Wolf-Rayet stars gamma^2 Vel (Vel OB2) and EZ CMa (Col 121), and the classical Cepheid delta Cep in Cep OB6. In the nearest associations the later-type members include T Tauri objects and other pre-main sequence stars. Astrometric evidence for moving groups in the fields of R CrA, CMa OB1, Mon OB1, Ori OB1, Cam OB1, Cep OB3, Cep OB4, Cyg OB4, Cyg OB7, and Sct OB2, is inconclusive, due to their large distance or unfavorable kinematics. The mean distances of the well-established groups are systematically smaller than previous estimates. The mean motions display a systematic pattern, which is discussed in relation to the Gould Belt. Six of the 12 detected moving groups do not appear in the classical list of nearby OB associations. The number of unbound young stellar groups in the Solar neighbourhood may be significantly larger than thought previously.","10.1086/300682","5.0","P. T. de Zeeuw; R. Hoogerwerf; J. H.

"A Millennial Myosin Census","The past decade has seen a remarkable explosion in our knowledge of the size and diversity of the myosin superfamily. Since these actin-based motors are candidates to provide the molecular basis for many cellular movements, it is essential that motility researchers be aware of the complete set of myosins in a given organism. The availability of cDNA and/or draft genomic sequences from humans,Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana,Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, andDictyostelium discoideum has allowed us to tentatively define and compare the sets of myosin genes in these organisms. This analysis has also led to the identification of several putative myosin genes that may be of general interest. In humans, for example, we find a total of 40 known or predicted myosin genes including two new myosins-I, three new class II (conventional) myosins, a second member of the class III/ninaC myosins, a gene similar to the class XV deafness myosin, and a novel myosin sharing at most 33% identity with other members of the superfamily. These myosins are in addition to the recently discovered class XVI myosin with N-terminal ankyrin repeats and two human genes with similarity to the class XVIII PDZ-myosin from mouse. We briefly describe these newly recognized myosins and extend our previous phylogenetic analysis of the myosin superfamily to include a comparison of the complete or nearly complete inventories of myosin genes from several experimentally important organisms.","10.1091/mbc.12.4.780","3.0","Jonathan S.

"Census and evaluation of p53 target genes","The tumor suppressor p53 functions primarily as a transcription factor. Mutation of the TP53 gene alters its response pathway, and is central to the development of many cancers. The discovery of a large number of p53 target genes, which confer p53's tumor suppressor function, has led to increasingly complex models of p53 function. Recent meta-analysis approaches, however, are simplifying our understanding of how p53 functions as a transcription factor. In the survey presented here, a total set of 3661 direct p53 target genes is identified that comprise 3509 potential targets from 13 high-throughput studies, and 346 target genes from individual gene analyses. Comparison of the p53 target genes reported in individual studies with those identified in 13 high-throughput studies reveals limited consistency. Here, p53 target genes have been evaluated based on the meta-analysis data, and the results show that high-confidence p53 target genes are involved in multiple cellular responses, including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, apoptosis, metabolism, autophagy, mRNA translation and feedback mechanisms. However, many p53 target genes are identified only in a small number of studies and have a higher likelihood of being false positives. While numerous mechanisms have been proposed for mediating gene regulation in response to p53, recent advances in our understanding of p53 function show that p53 itself is solely an activator of transcription, and gene downregulation by p53 is indirect and requires p21. Taking into account the function of p53 as an activator of transcription, recent results point to an unsophisticated means of regulation.","10.1038/onc.2016.502","1.0","Martin Fischer","2017.0","","","census; p; target; genes"
"A Census of Human Soluble Protein Complexes","Cellular processes often depend on stable physical associations between proteins. Despite recent progress, knowledge of the composition of human protein complexes remains limited. To close this gap, we applied an integrative global proteomic profiling approach, based on chromatographic separation of cultured human cell extracts into more than one thousand biochemical fractions that were subsequently analyzed by quantitative tandem mass spectrometry, to systematically identify a network of 13,993 high-confidence physical interactions among 3,006 stably associated soluble human proteins. Most of the 622 putative protein complexes we report are linked to core biological processes and encompass both candidate disease genes and unannotated proteins to inform on mechanism. Strikingly, whereas larger multiprotein assemblies tend to be more extensively annotated and evolutionarily conserved, human protein complexes with five or fewer subunits are far more likely to be functionally unannotated or restricted to vertebrates, suggesting more recent functional innovations.","10.1016/j.cell.2012.08.011","24.0","Pierre C.

"CENSUS AND CONSENSUS IN BACTERIAL ECOSYSTEMS: The LuxR-LuxI Family of Quorum-Sensing Transcriptional Regulators","The importance of accurate demographic information is reflected in the United States Constitution, Article 1, which provides for a decennial census of this country's human population. Bacteria also conduct a census of their population and do so more frequently, more efficiently, and as far we know, with little if any of the political contentiousness caused by human demographers. Many examples have been found of particular bacterial genes, operons, or regulons that are expressed preferentially at high cell densities. Many of these are regulated by proteins related to the LuxR and LuxI proteins of Vibrio fischeri, and by a diffusible pheromone called an autoinducer. LuxR and LuxI and their cognate autoinducer (3-oxohexanoyl homoserine lactone, designated VAI-1) provide an important model to describe the functions of this family of proteins. LuxR is a VAI-1 receptor and a VAI-1–dependent transcriptional activator, and LuxI directs the synthesis of VAI-1. VAI-1 diffuses across the bacterial envelope, and intracellular concentrations of it are therefore strongly increased by nearby VAI-1–producing bacteria. Similar systems regulate pathogenesis factors in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Erwinia spp., as well as Ti plasmid conjugal transfer in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and many other genes in numerous genera of gram-negative bacteria. Genetic analyses of these systems have revealed a high degree of functional conservation, while also uncovering features that are unique to each.","10.1146/annurev.micro.50.1.727","3.0","Clay Fuqua; Stephen C.

"Status of the Microbial Census","SUMMARY Over the past 20 years, more than 78,000 16S rRNA gene sequences have been deposited in GenBank and the Ribosomal Database Project, making the 16S rRNA gene the most widely studied gene for reconstructing bacterial phylogeny. While there is a general appreciation that these sequences are largely unique and derived from diverse species of bacteria, there has not been a quantitative attempt to describe the extent of sequencing efforts to date. We constructed rarefaction curves for each bacterial phylum and for the entire bacterial domain to assess the current state of sampling and the relative taxonomic richness of each phylum. This analysis quantifies the general sense among microbiologists that we are a long way from a complete census of the bacteria on Earth. Moreover, the analysis indicates that current sampling strategies might not be the most effective ones to describe novel diversity because there remain numerous phyla that are globally distributed yet poorly sampled. Based on the current level of sampling, it is not possible to estimate the total number of bacterial species on Earth, but the minimum species richness is 35,498. Considering previous global species richness estimates of 10 7 to 10 9 , we are certain that this estimate will increase with additional sequencing efforts. The data support previous calls for extensive surveys of multiple chemically disparate environments and of specific phylogenetic groups to advance the census most rapidly.","10.1128/mmbr.68.4.686-691.2004","2.0","Patrick D.

"Mechanism by Which Fatty Acids Inhibit Insulin Activation of Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 (IRS-1)-associated Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Activity in Muscle","Recent studies have demonstrated that fatty acids induce insulin resistance in skeletal muscle by blocking insulin activation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase). To examine the mechanism by which fatty acids mediate this effect, rats were infused with either a lipid emulsion (consisting mostly of 18:2 fatty acids) or glycerol. Intracellular C18:2 CoA increased in a time-dependent fashion, reaching an ∼6-fold elevation by 5 h, whereas there was no change in the concentration of any other fatty acyl-CoAs. Diacylglycerol (DAG) also increased transiently after 3–4 h of lipid infusion. In contrast there was no increase in intracellular ceramide or triglyceride concentrations during the lipid infusion. Increases in intracellular C18:2 CoA and DAG concentration were associated with protein kinase C (PKC)-θ activation and a reduction in both insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and IRS-1 associated PI3-kinase activity, which were associated with an increase in IRS-1 Ser307 phosphorylation. These data support the hypothesis that an increase in plasma fatty acid concentration results in an increase in intracellular fatty acyl-CoA and DAG concentrations, which results in activation of PKC-θ leading to increased IRS-1 Ser307 phosphorylation. This in turn leads to decreased IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and decreased activation of IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase activity resulting in decreased insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity.

The mechanism by which fatty acids induce insulin resistance in skeletal muscle remains controversial. Randle et al. (12Randle P.J. Garland P.B. Hales C.N. Newsholme E.A. Lancet. 1963; i: 785-789Abstract Scopus (3879) Google Scholar, 13Randle P.J. Newsholme E.A. Garland P.B. Biochem. J. 1964; 93: 652-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) first suggested that fatty acids might induce insulin resistance in skeletal muscle by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, resulting in an increase in intracellular citrate concentration, which would then result in inhibition of phosphofructokinase activity leading to an increase in intracellular glucose-6-phosphate; this in turn would inhibit hexokinase activity, resulting in decreased glucose uptake. More recent 31P/13C NMR studies in humans have revealed a very different mechanism of fatty acid-induced insulin resistance whereby an increase in plasma fatty acid concentration was shown to result in lower intramyocellullar glucose 6-phosphate (9Roden M.

These changes were associated with reduced insulin-stimulated IRS-11 tyrosine phosphorylation (11Griffin M.E. Marcucci M.J. Cline G.W. Bell K. Barucci N. Lee D. Goodyear L.J. Kraegen E.W. White M.F. Shulman G.I. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar) and IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) activity (10Dresner A. Laurent D. Marcucci M.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar) suggesting that fatty acids cause insulin resistance through inhibition of insulin signaling, which we hypothesized might occur through activation of a serine kinase cascade involving PKC-θ (11Griffin M.E. Marcucci M.J. Cline G.W. Bell K. Barucci N. Lee D. Goodyear L.J. Kraegen E.W. White M.F. Shulman G.I. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). To explore the possible roles of different intracellular fatty acid metabolites such as fatty acyl-CoA, diacylglycerol (DAG), ceramides, and triglycerides in mediating fatty acid-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, we measured these metabolites at different time intervals during a lipid infusion in relation to insulin stimulation: (i) insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, (ii) IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and (iii) IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase activity as well as PKC-θ translocation. In a separate group of in vitro soleus muscle studies, we also examined whether fatty acid-induced defects in insulin signaling were coupled to defects in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake across a range of insulin concentrations. LCACoA standards (C16:1, C16:0, C17:0, C18:2, C18:1, and C18:0), diacylglyceride standards, and ceramide standards (C6:0, C16:0, C18:0) were purchased from Sigma.N-Arachidoyl-d-sphingosine andN-lignoceroyl-d-sphingosine were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Arlington, AL). Antibody against IRS-1 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Antibody against the insulin receptor subunit andZymed phosphotyrosine and rabbit anti-peptide against nPKC-θ were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Caltag Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibody against PKC-θ was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Male Wistar rats (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) weighing between 250 and 300 g (for the time course study) and 50 and 75 g (for insulin dose response) were housed in an environmentally controlled room with a 12-h light/dark cycle and fed with regular rat chow diet. The rats were catheterized in the right jugular vein and carotid artery; the catheters were externalized through an incision in the skin flap behind their head. The rats were allowed to recover from surgery until they reached preoperative weight (∼5–7 days) and were fasted overnight (∼15 h) before the infusion experiment. All procedures were approved by the Yale University Animal Care and Use Committee. The rats were divided randomly into five study groups (6–8 rats/group). The control group was infused with isotonic saline solution for 5 h. The other groups were infused with a 20% triglycerides emulsion (Liposyn II, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) (5 ml/kg/h) combined with heparin (6 units/h) for 1, 3 and 5 h. A fifth wash-out group was infused with lipid/heparin for 5 h, which was then discontinued and followed with an isotonic saline infusion for another 3 h. Identical studies were performed for muscle DAG analysis (3–9 rats/group) with the addition of a 4-h lipid/heparin infusion group (n = 4). At the end of the infusions, rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg); soleus muscle samples, rapidly dissected and freeze-clamped in situ, were stored at −70 °C for measurement of fat metabolites. Soleus muscle was selected for all studies because it consists of mostly type 1 fiber, which is highly insulin-responsive and best reflects insulin action in human skeletal muscle (10Dresner A. Laurent D. Marcucci M. Griffin M.E. Dufour S. Cline G. Slezak L.A. Andersen D.K. Hundal R.S. Rothman D.L. Petersen K.F. Shulman G.I. J. Clin.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). To study the effect of fatty acids on insulin signaling in muscle at the same time points, we performed another set of identical parallel studies in five groups (basal, 1, 3, an 5 h lipid/heparin infusion and 3 h wash-out) under conditions identical to those described above, adding a 20-min hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp following the lipid/heparin or saline infusion. In these studies an intravenous bolus (150 milliunits/kg for 45 s, 75 milliunits/kg for another 45 s) of insulin (humulin regular insulin, Eli Lily, Indianapolis, IN) was followed by a constant insulin infusion at 10 milliunits/kg/min, with plasma glucose concentration clamped at 5.5 mm using a variable infusion of glucose (50g/dl) to maintain euglycemia as described previously (11Griffin M.E. Marcucci M.J. Cline G.W. Bell K. Barucci N. Lee D. Goodyear L.J. Kraegen E.W. White M.F. Shulman G.I. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). At the end of the clamps, rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). Soleus muscle samples were rapidly dissected, freeze-clamped in situ, and stored at −70 °C for insulin signaling assays. Rats were euthanized with a lethal dose of pentobarbital. LCACoAs were extracted from frozen tissue samples (∼100 mg) and purified using a solid phase extraction method described previously by Deutsch et al. (15Deutsch J. Grange E. Rapoport S.I. Purdon A.D. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) with minor modifications for desalting. A known amount of heptadecanoyl-CoA was added as an internal standard. OPC columns (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were used for solid phase extraction. Samples were dissolved in 100 μl of methanol/H2O for LC/MS/MS analysis. DAGs and ceramides were extracted from frozen tissue (∼100 mg) with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) containing 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene. Prior to the extraction, known amounts of 1,3-dipentadecanoin, triheptadecanoin, and hexanoylsphingosine were added as internal standards. Extracted samples were evaporated to dryness and redissolved in 1 ml of hexane-methylene chloride-ethyl ether (95:5:0.5, v/v/v). DAGs were isolated from triglycerides by use of a diol bonded-phase SPE column (Waters, Inc., Milford, MA) under vacuum, as described previously (16Pacheco Y.M. Perez-Camino M.C. Cert A. Montero E. Ruiz-Gutierrez V. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1998; 714: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, the SPE column was preconditioned with 4 ml of hexane. The lipid extract was then placed on the column, and triglycerides were eluted with 8 ml of hexane-methylene chloride-ethyl ether (89:10:1, v/v/v). DAGs were eluted with 8 ml of hexane-ethyl acetate (85:15, v/v) into a second set of collection tubes. The solvent was evaporated to dryness under vacuum and redissolved in 0.5 ml of hexane-ethyl acetate (85:15, v/v) for LC/MS/MS analysis. Monitoring for the presence of triheptadecanoin in the DAG fraction assessed the separation of triglycerides from DAGs. A bench-top tandem mass spectrometer, API 3000 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), interfaced with a TurboIonspray ionization source or atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source was used. Peripherals included a PerkinElmer series 200 micro-pump and an autosampler. LCACoAs were ionized in negative electrospray mode. Doubly charged ions and corresponding product ions were chosen as transition pairs for each CoA species (C16:1, C16:0, C18:2, C18:1, and C18:0) for selective reactions monitoring (SRM) quantitation. Total LCACoAs contents were obtained from the sum of individual species. Methanol/H2O (60/40) was used as continuous flow at 300 μl/min, and 5 μl of sample was injected for analysis. DAGs (derived from C16:1, C16:0, C18:2, C18:1, and C18:0) and ceramides (C16:0, C18:0, C20:0, C22:0, C24:1, C24:0) were ionized in positive atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mode. [M+H-18]+/product ions from corresponding fatty acid moiety were monitored for SRM quantitation for DAGs. [M+H-18]+/264.3 were monitored for ceramide species for quantitation. The same mobile phase was used for LCACoAs at 300 μl/min with 3 μl of sample injected. After a 5-h infusion with glycerol (as control) or lipid/heparin at 85 μl/kg/min, rats were anesthetized with an intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). Soleus muscles were isolated from the rats and preincubated in oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonated (KHB) buffer containing 2 mm pyruvate, 36 mm mannitol, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (preincubation buffer) to recover for 30 min at 18 °C. The soleus muscles were then incubated at 29 °C in oxygenated preincubation buffer with various concentration of insulin (0, 50, 1,000, or 10,000 microunits/ml) for 35 min. After incubation, the muscles were rinsed with ice-cold saline and freeze-clamped in liquid nitrogen for analysis of insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and insulin-stimulated IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase activity. To measure the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in the muscle, soleus muscles were preincubated at 29 °C with various concentrations of insulin (0, 50, 1,000, or 10,000 microunits/ml) for 35 min followed by incubation in KHB buffer containing 1 mm [3H]2-deoxyglucose and 39 mm [1-14C]mannitol for an additional 20 min. For IRS-1 serine phosphorylation analysis, after a 5-h lipid infusion, soleus muscles were freeze-clamped in situ and kept in liquid nitrogen until analysis. Muscle samples were ground under liquid nitrogen and homogenized in a ice-cold Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNaVO4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton-100, 10% glycerol, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The homogenates were centrifuged at 20,500 × g for 1 h. Supernatants were collected, and protein concentration was measured with the Bradford protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). Muscle homogenates (4 mg protein) were immunoprecipitated with 4 μg of anti-IRS-1 antibody for 18 h for IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and PI3-kinase activity assay or with 4 μg of anti-IR antibody for IR tyrosine phosphorylation. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times by brief centrifugation and gentle resuspension in ice-cold homogenization buffer plus 0.1% SDS. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 4–12% gradient gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry electro-blotter (Owl Separation System, Portsmouth, NH). The membranes were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified by densitometry (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was stripped with 100 mm glycine, pH 3.0, and reblotted with anti-IRS-1 antibody to determine the amount of IRS-1 proteins. IRS-1 serine phosphorylation was measured using a site-specific antibody, phospho-Ser307, generated in Dr. Morris White's laboratory (17Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R. White M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting procedures were the same as for IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, twice with 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 500 mmLiCl2, and twice with 10 mm Tris containing 150 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA. 100 μmNa3VO4 was included in all the wash buffers. Kinase reactions were done as described previously (11Griffin M.E. Marcucci M.J. Cline G.W. Bell K. Barucci N. Lee D. Goodyear L.J. Kraegen E.W. White M.F. Shulman G.I. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar).32P was captured with a storage phosphor-screen, and the screen was scanned with a Storm system. Images were analyzed and quantified using ImageQuant software. 100 mg of soleus muscle was homogenized and extracted in 4× (w/v) ice cold 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 250 mm mannitol, 1.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (200 μg/ml), and 2 mm benzamidine. The homogenate was solubilized by hand for 2 min and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 100,000 ×g. Separation of cytosol and membrane fraction was done as described previously (18Laybutt D.R. Schmitz-Peiffer C. Saha A.K. Ruderman N.B. Biden T.J. Kraegen E.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E1070-E1076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5 (cytosolic) or 10 μg (particulate) of protein was loaded and subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% gel, 187 V). Proteins separated on the gels were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filter membranes (Amersham Biosciences) in 19 mm Tris, pH 8.9, buffer containing 140 mmglycine at 90 V for 90 min. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were probed with 0.625 μg/ml anti-PKC-θ antibody (Transduction Laboratories) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:5,000) for 2 h. PKC isozymes visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents and quantitated by densitometry using a Medical Dynamics Personal Densitometer SI and IP Lab Gel H software (Signal Analytics, Vienna, VA). Individual band densities were adjusted for inter-gel variability using the standard, and the amount of PKCθ in each fraction were calculated according to the total amount of protein in the final volume of supernatant extracted. Plasma fatty acid concentration was determined with an acyl-CoA oxidase-based colorimetric kit (Wako NEFA-C, Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan). Tissue triglycerides were extracted by adapting the method described by Storlien et al. (19Storlien L.H. Jenkins A.B. Chisholm D.J. Pascoe W.S. Khouri S. Kraegen E.W. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar), and triglyceride content was measured using a kit from Sigma. Data were expressed as means ± S.E. Analysis of data using analysis-of-variance with one-way post-hoc tests (Fisher's protected least significant difference) was done to determine the differences between control and different time courses of lipid infusion groups at a minimum p < 0.05 threshold. Basal plasma fatty concentration increased rapidly following the lipid/heparin infusion and remained constant until the saline wash-out period during which time it returned to base-line concentration (Fig. 1 A). This increase in plasma fatty acid concentration in the lipid-infused group resulted in increases in both intramuscular LCACoAs and DAG concentration in the soleus muscle compared with the control group (Fig. 1, B andC). Although the LCACoA continued to increase throughout the lipid infusion, the DAGs reached a peak concentration at 3–4 h and then surprisingly decreased to basal concentrations despite continued lipid infusion (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, lipid infusion had no effect on intramyocellullar ceramide content (Fig. 1 D) or muscle triglyceride (Fig. 1 E) content except at the 1-h time point, at which time the concentration decreased compared with base line. The increase in total LCACoA concentration could be accounted for entirely by a selective increase in C18:2 CoA (major fatty acid composition in liposyn II) (3.86 ± 0.46 nmol/g of weight for control group, 9.30* ± 0.87, 16.17** ± 2.37, and 18.89** ± 2.51 nmol/g of weight after a 1-h, 3-h, and 5-h lipid infusion and 7.22 ± 1.22 nmol/g of weight after wash-out period; *, p < 0.05 versus control; **,p < 0.001 versus control; Fig. 2 A). In contrast the transient ∼3–4-fold increase in total DAG content at 3–4 h (0.65 ± 0.14 μmol/g of weight for control group, 1.43 ± 0.51, 2.73 ± 0.83+, 2.54 ± 0.79+, 1.36 ± 0.40, 0.96 ± 0.31 μmol/g of weight for 1-h, 3-h, 4-h, 5-h and wash-out groups, respectively; +, p ≤ 0.006versus control) could be attributed to an increase in virtually all DAG species (Fig. 2 B). These increases in intracellular LCACoA and DAG concentrations were associated with PKC-θ activation, as reflected by a significant reduction in the fraction of PKC-θ in the cytosol and a significant increase in the PKC-θ membrane-associated/cytosol fraction after 5 h of lipid infusion (both p = 0.04 versus control group; Fig. 3). There was also a reduction in total PKC-θ content, which is consistent with previous observations in a high-fat fed rat model that had increased intramuscular lipid accumulation (20Schmitz-Peiffer C.

In parallel with these results insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase activity also returned to normal. To determine whether higher concentrations of insulin could overcome these lipid-induced defects in insulin signaling and action, we also examined insulin-stimulated muscle glucose uptake and insulin signaling across a wide range of insulin concentrations (50, 1,000, and 10,000 microunits/ml) in an in vitro soleus muscle preparation following 5 h of either lipid or glycerol infusion. Consistent with our previous results, 5 h of lipid infusion induced a profound defect in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, which occurred across all insulin concentrations (Fig. 6). This reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was paralleled by similar reductions in insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase activity across all insulin concentrations, but there was no change in insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 7). Taken together these results demonstrates that fatty acids induce a defect in insulin activation of PI3-kinase at the level of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation that cannot be overcome with supraphysiologic concentrations of insulin.Figure 7Insulin dose response for the effects of fatty acids on insulin signaling in soleus muscle in vitro.

The changes in these fatty acid metabolite concentrations were then compared with changes in insulin-stimulated insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase activity, and PKC-θ translocation. We found that during the lipid infusion intra- myocellullar C18:2 CoA concentration increased by ∼6-fold and that it was the only intracellular fatty acyl-CoA to increase. Because the infused intralipid consisted mostly of C18:2 fatty acids, these data strongly suggest that this intracellular fatty acyl-CoA was derived from the infused lipid. Following the increase in intracellular C18:2 CoA, there was a ∼3-fold increase in intracellular DAG, which peaked at 3–4 h and then surprisingly declined despite persistent elevation in plasma fatty acid concentrations. In contrast to the fatty acyl-CoA, which consisted mostly of C18:2 fatty acids, the increase in DAG consisted of virtually all measured fatty acids. Taken together these data suggest that an increase in intracellular fatty acyl-CoA activates a phospholipase that leads to production of DAG from endogenous lipid sources, which might explain the observed decrease in intramuscular triglyceride content during the first couple of hours of the lipid infusion. In contrast to the increases in intracellular fatty acyl-CoA and DAG, there were no significant increases in intracellular ceramides or triglyceride concentrations during the 5-h lipid infusion, which suggests that these metabolites do not play a major role in mediating fatty acid-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. In parallel with the increases in intracellular fatty acyl-CoA, we observed a ∼30% reduction in insulin activation of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and an ∼50% reduction in IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase activity after 5 h of lipid infusion, which coincided with activation of PKC-θ. These data might explain the 3–5 h delay for fatty acid-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle resulting from an intralipid/heparin infusion (8Boden G. Chen X. J. Clin.

"Estimates of Income for Small Places: An Application of James-Stein Procedures to Census Data","An adaptation of the James-Stein estimator is applied to sample estimates of income for small places (i.e., population less than 1,000) from the 1970 Census of Population and Housing. The adaptation incorporates linear regression in the context of unequal variances. Evidence is presented that the resulting estimates have smaller average error than either the sample estimates or an alternate procedure of using county averages. The new estimates for these small places now form the basis for the Census Bureau's updated estimates of per capita income for the General Revenue Sharing Program.","10.1080/01621459.1979.10482505","2.0","Robert E.

"Phosphorylation of IRS proteins, insulin action, and insulin resistance","Insulin signaling at target tissues is essential for growth and development and for normal homeostasis of glucose, fat, and protein metabolism. Control over this process is therefore tightly regulated. It can be achieved by a negative feedback control mechanism whereby downstream components inhibit upstream elements along the insulin-signaling pathway (autoregulation) or by signals from apparently unrelated pathways that inhibit insulin signaling thus leading to insulin resistance. Phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins on serine residues has emerged as a key step in these control processes under both physiological and pathological conditions. The list of IRS kinases implicated in the development of insulin resistance is growing rapidly, concomitant with the list of potential Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites in IRS proteins. Here, we review a range of conditions that activate IRS kinases to phosphorylate IRS proteins on ""hot spot"" domains. The flexibility vs. specificity features of this reaction is discussed and its characteristic as an ""array"" phosphorylation is suggested. Finally, its implications on insulin signaling, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, an emerging epidemic of the 21st century are outlined.","10.1152/ajpendo.90437.2008","2.0","Sigalit Boura‐Halfon; Yehiel Zick","2008.0","","","phosphorylation; irs; action; insulin; resistance"
"A Simple Design of IRS-NOMA Transmission","This letter proposes a simple design of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) downlink transmission. In particular, conventional spatial division multiple access (SDMA) is used first at the base station to generate orthogonal beams by using the spatial directions of the near users' channels. Then, IRS-assisted NOMA is used to ensure that additional cell-edge users can also be served on these beams by aligning the cell-edge users' effective channel vectors with the predetermined spatial directions. Both analytical and simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed IRS-NOMA scheme and also study the impact of hardware impairments on IRS-NOMA.","10.1109/lcomm.2020.2974196","2.0","Zhiguo Ding; H.

"Do IRS Audits Deter Corporate Tax Avoidance?","ABSTRACT We extend research on the determinants of corporate tax avoidance to include the role of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) monitoring. Our evidence from large samples implies that U.S. public firms undertake less aggressive tax positions when tax enforcement is stricter. Reflecting its first-order economic impact on firms, our coefficient estimates imply that raising the probability of an IRS audit from 19 percent (the 25th percentile in our data) to 37 percent (the 75th percentile) increases their cash effective tax rates, on average, by nearly two percentage points, which amounts to a 7 percent increase in cash effective tax rates. These results are robust to controlling for firm size and time, which determine our primary proxy for IRS enforcement, in different ways; specifying several alternative dependent and test variables; and confronting potential endogeneity with instrumental variables and panel data estimations, among other techniques.

"Cyberbullying, School Bullying, and Psychological Distress: A Regional Census of High School Students","Using data from a regional census of high school students, we have documented the prevalence of cyberbullying and school bullying victimization and their associations with psychological distress.In the fall of 2008, 20,406 ninth- through twelfth-grade students in MetroWest Massachusetts completed surveys assessing their bullying victimization and psychological distress, including depressive symptoms, self-injury, and suicidality.A total of 15.8% of students reported cyberbullying and 25.9% reported school bullying in the past 12 months. A majority (59.7%) of cyberbullying victims were also school bullying victims; 36.3% of school bullying victims were also cyberbullying victims. Victimization was higher among nonheterosexually identified youths. Victims report lower school performance and school attachment. Controlled analyses indicated that distress was highest among victims of both cyberbullying and school bullying (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] were from 4.38 for depressive symptoms to 5.35 for suicide attempts requiring medical treatment). Victims of either form of bullying alone also reported elevated levels of distress.Our findings confirm the need for prevention efforts that address both forms of bullying and their relation to school performance and mental health.","10.2105/ajph.2011.300308","4.0","Shari Kessel Schneider; Lydia O’Donnell; Ann Stueve; Robert W.

"Disaggregating Census Data for Population Mapping Using Random Forests with Remotely-Sensed and Ancillary Data","High resolution, contemporary data on human population distributions are vital for measuring impacts of population growth, monitoring human-environment interactions and for planning and policy development. Many methods are used to disaggregate census data and predict population densities for finer scale, gridded population data sets. We present a new semi-automated dasymetric modeling approach that incorporates detailed census and ancillary data in a flexible, ""Random Forest"" estimation technique. We outline the combination of widely available, remotely-sensed and geospatial data that contribute to the modeled dasymetric weights and then use the Random Forest model to generate a gridded prediction of population density at ~100 m spatial resolution. This prediction layer is then used as the weighting surface to perform dasymetric redistribution of the census counts at a country level. As a case study we compare the new algorithm and its products for three countries (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Kenya) with other common gridded population data production methodologies. We discuss the advantages of the new method and increases over the accuracy and flexibility of those previous approaches. Finally, we outline how this algorithm will be extended to provide freely-available gridded population data sets for Africa, Asia and Latin America.","10.1371/journal.pone.0107042","4.0","Forrest R.

"Ecological Fallacies and the Analysis of Areal Census Data","In many countries census data are only reported for areal units and not at the individual level. This custom raises the spectre of ecological fallacy problems. In this paper, a 10% sample census (from the United Kingdom) and individual census data (from Italy) are used to provide an empirical demonstration of the nature and magnitude of these problems. It is concluded that ecological fallacy effects are endemic to areal census data, although their magnitude is perhaps not as large as might have been expected. The principal difficulty is that there is at present no way of predicting in advance the degree of severity likely to be associated with particular variables and particular techniques. Finally, a suggestion is made concerning how the potentially serious practical consequences can be reduced.","10.1068/a160017","1.0","Stan Openshaw","1984.0","","","fallacies; areal; census"

"GTDB: an ongoing census of bacterial and archaeal diversity through a phylogenetically consistent, rank normalized and complete genome-based taxonomy","Abstract The Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB; https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org) provides a phylogenetically consistent and rank normalized genome-based taxonomy for prokaryotic genomes sourced from the NCBI Assembly database. GTDB R06-RS202 spans 254 090 bacterial and 4316 archaeal genomes, a 270% increase since the introduction of the GTDB in November, 2017. These genomes are organized into 45 555 bacterial and 2339 archaeal species clusters which is a 200% increase since the integration of species clusters into the GTDB in June, 2019. Here, we explore prokaryotic diversity from the perspective of the GTDB and highlight the importance of metagenome-assembled genomes in expanding available genomic representation. We also discuss improvements to the GTDB website which allow tracking of taxonomic changes, easy assessment of genome assembly quality, and identification of genomes assembled from type material or used as species representatives. Methodological updates and policy changes made since the inception of the GTDB are then described along with the procedure used to update species clusters in the GTDB. We conclude with a discussion on the use of average nucleotide identities as a pragmatic approach for delineating prokaryotic species.","10.1093/nar/gkab776","6.0","Donovan H.

"IRS Attention","We study how public and private disclosure requirements interact to influence both tax regulator enforcement and firm disclosure. To capture IRS enforcement activities, we introduce a novel data set of IRS acquisition of firms' public financial disclosures, which we label IRS attention. We examine the implementation of two new disclosure requirements that potentially alter IRS attention: FIN 48, which increased public tax disclosure requirements, and Schedule UTP, which increased private tax disclosure. We find that IRS attention increased following FIN 48 but subsequently decreased following Schedule UTP, consistent with public and private disclosure interacting to influence tax enforcement. We next examine how private tax disclosure requirements under Schedule UTP affected firms' public disclosure responses. We find that, following Schedule UTP, firms significantly increased the quantity and altered the content of their tax-related disclosures, consistent with lower tax-related proprietary costs of disclosure. Our results suggest that changes in SEC disclosure requirements altered the IRS's behavior with regard to public information acquisition, and, relatedly, changes in IRS private disclosure requirements appear to change firms' public disclosure behavior.","10.1111/1475-679x.12154","4.0","Zahn Bozanic; Jeffrey L.

"Bacterial census of poultry intestinal microbiome","The objective of this study was to generate a phylogenetic diversity census of bacteria identified in the intestinal tract of chickens and turkeys using a naïve analysis of all the curated 16S rRNA gene sequences archived in public databases. High-quality sequences of chicken and turkey gastrointestinal origin (3,184 and 1,345, respectively) were collected from the GenBank, Ribosomal Database Project, and Silva comprehensive ribosomal RNA database. Through phylogenetic and statistical analysis, 915 and 464 species-equivalent operational taxonomic units (defined at 0.03 phylogenetic distance) were found in the chicken and the turkey sequence collections, respectively. Of the 13 bacterial phyla identified in both bird species, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria were the largest phyla, accounting for >90% of all the sequences. The chicken sequences represent 117 established bacterial genera, and the turkey sequences represent 69 genera. The most predominant genera found in both the chicken and the turkey sequence data sets were Clostridium, Ruminococcus, Lactobacillus, and Bacteroides, but with different distribution between the 2 bird species. The estimated coverage of bacterial diversity of chicken and turkey reached 89 and 68% at species-equivalent and 93 and 73% at genus-equivalent levels, respectively. Less than 7,000 bacterial sequences from each bird species from various locations would be needed to reach 99% coverage for either bird species. Based on annotation of the sequence records, cecum was the most sampled gut segment. Chickens and turkeys were shown to have distinct intestinal microbiomes, sharing only 16% similarity at the species-equivalent level. Besides identifying gaps in knowledge on bacterial diversity in poultry gastrointestinal tract, the bacterial census generated in this study may serve as a framework for future studies and development of analytic tools.","10.3382/ps.2012-02822","3.0","Shengbao Wei; Mark Morrison; Zhongtang Yu","2013.0","","","bacterial; census; poultry; microbiome"

"A Census of Marine Biodiversity Knowledge, Resources, and Future Challenges","The Census of Marine Life (2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010) was the largest global research programme on marine biodiversity.This paper integrated the findings of reviews of major world regions by the Census and provides a global perspective on what is known and what are the major scientific gaps.Study metrics were regional species richness, numbers of endemic and alien species, numbers of species identification guides and taxonomic experts, and a state-ofknowledge index.The threats to biodiversity were classified across the regions.A poor to moderate correlation between species richness and seabed area, and sea volume, and no correlations with topographic variation, were attributed to sparse, uneven and unrepresentative sampling in much of the global marine environment.Many habitats have been poorly sampled, particularly in deeper seas, and several species-rich taxonomic groups, especially of smaller organisms, remain poorly studied.Crustacea, Mollusca, and Pisces comprised approximately half of all known species across the regions.The proportion that these and other taxa comprised of all taxa varied sufficiently to question whether the relative number of species within phyla and classes are constant throughout the world.Overfishing and pollution were identified as the main threats to biodiversity across all regions, followed by alien species, altered temperature, acidification, and hypoxia, although their relative importance varied among regions.The findings were replicated worldwide, in both developed and developing countries: i.e. major gaps exist in sampling effort and taxonomic expertise that impair society's ability to discover new species and identify and understand species of economic and ecological importance.There was a positive relationship between the availability of species identification guides and knowledge of biodiversity, including the number of species and alien species.Available taxonomic guides and experts correlated negatively with endemic species, suggesting that the more we study the ocean the fewer endemic species are evident.There is a need to accelerate the discovery of marine biodiversity, since much of it may be lost without even being known.We discuss how international collaboration between developed and developing countries is essential for improving productivity in the discovery and management of marine biodiversity, and how various sectors may contribute to this.Although the economic exploitation of marine resources dates back to prehistoric times, and historical documentation has existed since the third century B.C.","10.1371/journal.pone.0012110","6.0","Mark J.

"Complementary roles of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in the hepatic regulation of metabolism","Hepatic insulin resistance is a critical component in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In many cases, insulin resistance in liver is associated with reduced expression of both major insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins, IRS-1 and IRS-2. To investigate the specific functions of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in regulating liver function in vivo, we developed an adenovirus-mediated RNA interference technique in which short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are used to knock down IRS-1, IRS-2, or both, by 70–80% in livers of WT mice. The knockdown of IRS-1 resulted in an upregulation of the gluconeogenic enzymes glucose-6 phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, as well as a marked increase in hepatic nuclear factor–4 α. Decreased IRS-1 was also associated with a decrease in glucokinase expression and a trend toward increased blood glucose, whereas knockdown of IRS-2 resulted in the upregulation of lipogenic enzymes SREBP-1c and fatty acid synthase, as well as increased hepatic lipid accumulation. The concomitant injection of IRS-1 and IRS-2 adenoviral shRNAs resulted in systemic insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and hepatic steatosis. The alterations in the dual-knockdown mice were associated with defective Akt activation and Foxo1 phosphorylation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that hepatic IRS-1 and IRS-2 have complementary roles in the control of hepatic metabolism, with IRS-1 more closely linked to glucose homeostasis and IRS-2 more closely linked to lipid metabolism.","10.1172/jci23187","3.0","Cullen M.

"A Census of the Young Cluster IC 348","We present a new census of the stellar and substellar members of the young cluster IC 348. We have obtained images at I and Z for a 42'x28' field encompassing the cluster and have combined these measurements with previous optical and near-infrared photometry. From spectroscopy of candidate cluster members appearing in these data, we have identified 122 new members, 15 of which have spectral types of M6.5-M9, corresponding to masses of 0.08-0.015 M_sun by recent evolutionary models. The latest census for IC 348 now contains a total of 288 members, 23 of which are later than M6 and thus are likely to be brown dwarfs. From an extinction-limited sample of members (A_V&lt;=4) for a 16'x14' field centered on the cluster, we construct an IMF that is unbiased in mass and nearly complete for M/M_sun&gt;=0.03 (&lt;=M8). In logarithmic units where the Salpeter slope is 1.35, the mass function for IC 348 rises from high masses down to a solar mass, rises more slowly down to a maximum at 0.1-0.2 M_sun, and then declines into the substellar regime. In comparison, the similarly-derived IMF for Taurus from Briceno et al. and Luhman et al. rises quickly to a peak near 0.8 M_sun and steadily declines to lower masses. The distinctive shapes of the IMFs in IC 348 and Taurus are reflected in the distributions of spectral types, which peak at M5 and K7, respectively. These data provide compelling, model-independent evidence for a significant variation of the IMF with star-forming conditions.","10.1086/376594","7.0","K. L. Luhman; J. R. Stauffer; August Muench; G.

"Dam nation: A geographic census of American dams and their large‐scale hydrologic impacts","Newly available data indicate that dams fragment the fluvial system of the continental United States and that their impact on river discharge is several times greater than impacts deemed likely as a result of global climate change. The 75,000 dams in the continental United States are capable of storing a volume of water almost equaling one year's mean runoff, but there is considerable geographic variation in potential surface water impacts. In some western mountain and plains regions, dams can store more than 3 year's runoff, while in the Northeast and Northwest, storage is as little as 25% of the annual runoff. Dams partition watersheds; the drainage area per dam varies from 44 km 2 (17 miles 2 ) per dam in New England to 811 km 2 (313 miles 2 ) per dam in the Lower Colorado basin. Storage volumes, indicators of general hydrologic effects of dams, range from 26,200 m 3 km −2 (55 acre‐feet mile −2 ) in the Great Basin to 345,000 m 3 km −2 (725 acre‐feet mile −2 ) in the South Atlantic region. The greatest river flow impacts occur in the Great Plains, Rocky Mountains, and the arid Southwest, where storage is up to 3.8 times the mean annual runoff. The nation's dams store 5000 m 3 (4 acre‐feet) of water per person. Water resource regions have experienced individualized histories of cumulative increases in reservoir storage (and thus of downstream hydrologic and ecologic impacts), but the most rapid increases in storage occurred between the late 1950s and the late 1970s. Since 1980, increases in storage have been relatively minor.","10.1029/1999wr900016","1.0","William L. Graf","1999.0","Colorado","","dam; nation; a; census; dams; scale; hydrologic; impacts"
"Toward a Census of Bacteria in Soil","For more than a century, microbiologists have sought to determine the species richness of bacteria in soil, but the extreme complexity and unknown structure of soil microbial communities have obscured the answer. We developed a statistical model that makes the problem of estimating richness statistically accessible by evaluating the characteristics of samples drawn from simulated communities with parametric community distributions. We identified simulated communities with rank-abundance distributions that followed a truncated lognormal distribution whose samples resembled the structure of 16S rRNA gene sequence collections made using Alaskan and Minnesotan soils. The simulated communities constructed based on the distribution of 16S rRNA gene sequences sampled from the Alaskan and Minnesotan soils had a richness of 5,000 and 2,000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), respectively, where an OTU represents a collection of sequences not more than 3% distant from each other. To sample each of these OTUs in the Alaskan 16S rRNA gene library at least twice, 480,000 sequences would be required; however, to estimate the richness of the simulated communities using nonparametric richness estimators would require only 18,000 sequences. Quantifying the richness of complex environments such as soil is an important step in building an ecological framework. We have shown that generating sufficient sequence data to do so requires less sequencing effort than completely sequencing a bacterial genome.","10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020092","2.0","Patrick D.

"Pleiotropic insulin signals are engaged by multisite phosphorylation of IRS-1.","IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate 1) is a principal insulin receptor substrate that undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation during insulin stimulation. It contains over 20 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, and we suspect that multiple insulin signals are enabled when the activated insulin receptor kinase phosphorylates several of them. Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 binds specifically to various cellular proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains (SH2 proteins). We identified some of the tyrosine residues of IRS-1 that undergo insulin-stimulated phosphorylation by the purified insulin receptor and in intact cells during insulin stimulation. Automated sequencing and manual radiosequencing revealed the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues 460, 608, 628, 895, 939, 987, 1172, and 1222; additional sites remain to be identified. Immobilized SH2 domains from the 85-kDa regulatory subunit (p85 alpha) of the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase bind preferentially to tryptic phosphopeptides containing Tyr(P)-608 and Tyr(P)-939. By contrast, the SH2 domain in GRB2 and the amino-terminal SH2 domain in SHPTP2 (Syp) specifically bind to Tyr(P)-895 and Tyr(P)-1172, respectively. These results confirm the p85 alpha recognizes YMXM motifs and suggest that GRB2 prefers a phosphorylated YVNI motif, whereas SHPTP2 (Syp) binds to a phosphorylated YIDL motif. These results extend the notion that IRS-1 is a multisite docking protein that engages various downstream regulatory elements during insulin signal transmission.","10.1128/mcb.13.12.7418","5.0","Xiao‐Jian Sun; Dan L.

"Face detection with the modified census transform","Illumination variation is a big problem in object recognition, which usually requires a costly compensation prior to classification. It would be desirable to have an image-to-image transform, which uncovers only the structure of an object for an efficient matching. In this context the contribution of our work is two-fold. First, we introduce illumination invariant local structure features for object detection. For an efficient computation we propose a modified census transform which enhances the original work of Zabih and Woodfill. We show some shortcomings and how to get over them with the modified version. S6econdly, we introduce an efficient four-stage classifier for rapid detection. Each single stage classifier is a linear classifier, which consists of a set of feature lookup-tables. We show that the first stage, which evaluates only 20 features filters out more than 99% of all background positions. Thus, the classifier structure is much simpler than previous described multi-stage approaches, while having similar capabilities. The combination of illumination invariant features together with a simple classifier leads to a real-time system on standard computers (60 msec, image size: 288/spl times/384, 2GHi Pentium). Detection results are presented on two commonly used databases in this field namely the MIT+CMU set of 130 images and the BioID set of 1526 images. We are achieving detection rates of more than 90% with a very low false positive rate of 10/sup -7/%.

"The Impacts of Environmental Regulations on Industrial Activity: Evidence from the 1970 and 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments and the Census of Manufactures","This paper estimates the impacts of the Clean Air Act's division of counties into pollutant‐specific nonattainment and attainment categories on measures of industrial activity obtained from 1.75 million plant observations from the Census of Manufactures. Emitters of the controlled pollutants in nonattainment counties were subject to greater regulatory oversight than emitters in attainment counties. The preferred statistical model for plant‐level growth includes plant fixed effects, industry by period fixed effects, and county by period fixed effects. The estimates from this model suggest that in the first 15 years in which the Clean Air Act was in force (1972–87), nonattainment counties (relative to attainment ones) lost approximately 590,000 jobs, $37 billion in capital stock, and $75 billion (1987 dollars) of output in pollution‐intensive industries. These findings are robust across many specifications, and the effects are apparent in many polluting industries.","10.1086/342808","1.0","Michael Greenstone","2002.0","","Census of Manufactures","impacts; regulations; industrial; activity; evidence; clean; air; act; amendments; census; manufactures"

"UnFlow: Unsupervised Learning of Optical Flow With a Bidirectional Census Loss","In the era of end-to-end deep learning, many advances in computer vision are driven by large amounts of labeled data. In the optical flow setting, however, obtaining dense per-pixel ground truth for real scenes is difficult and thus such data is rare. Therefore, recent end-to-end convolutional networks for optical flow rely on synthetic datasets for supervision, but the domain mismatch between training and test scenarios continues to be a challenge. Inspired by classical energy-based optical flow methods, we design an unsupervised loss based on occlusion-aware bidirectional flow estimation and the robust census transform to circumvent the need for ground truth flow. On the KITTI benchmarks, our unsupervised approach outperforms previous unsupervised deep networks by a large margin, and is even more accurate than similar supervised methods trained on synthetic datasets alone. By optionally fine-tuning on the KITTI training data, our method achieves competitive optical flow accuracy on the KITTI 2012 and 2015 benchmarks, thus in addition enabling generic pre-training of supervised networks for datasets with limited amounts of ground truth.","10.1609/aaai.v32i1.12276","3.0","Simon Meister; Junhwa Hur; Stefan Roth","2018.0","","","unflow; learning; optical; flow; bidirectional; census; loss"

"China's Floating Population: New Evidence from the 2000 Census","This article uses tabulations from the 2000 Population Census of China along with a micro‐level data sample from the census to provide a picture of China's floating population: migrants without local household registration ( hukou ), a status resulting in significant social and economic disadvantages. By 2000, the size of China's floating population had grown to nearly 79 million, if that category is defined as migrants who moved between provinces or counties and resided at their destinations for six months or more. Intra‐county floating migration is similarly large, contributing another 66 million to the size of the floating population. The article also discusses the geographic pattern of the floating population and the reasons for moving as reported by migrants.

"Contrasting Effects of IRS-1 Versus IRS-2 Gene Disruption on Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolism in Vivo","To examine the impact of homozygous genetic disruption of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 (IRS-1<sup>−/−</sup>) or IRS-2 (IRS-2<sup>−/−</sup>) on basal and insulin-stimulated carbohydrate and lipid metabolism <i>in vivo</i>, we infused 18-h fasted mice (wild-type (WT), IRS-1<sup>−/−</sup>, and IRS-2<sup>−/−</sup>) with [3-<sup>3</sup>H]glucose and [<sup>2</sup>H<sub>5</sub>]glycerol and assessed rates of glucose and glycerol turnover under basal (0–90 min) and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (90–210 min; 5 mm glucose, and 5 milliunits of insulin·kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup>·min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup>) conditions. Both IRS-1<sup>−</sup><sup>/−</sup> and IRS-2<sup>−</sup><sup>/−</sup> mice were insulin-resistant as reflected by markedly impaired insulin-stimulated whole-body glucose utilization compared with WT mice. Insulin resistance in the IRS-1<sup>−</sup><sup>/−</sup> mice could be ascribed mainly to decreased insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose metabolism. In contrast, IRS-2<sup>−</sup><sup>/−</sup> mice displayed multiple defects in insulin-mediated carbohydrate metabolism as reflected by (i) decreased peripheral glucose utilization, (ii) decreased suppression of endogenous glucose production, and (iii) decreased hepatic glycogen synthesis. Additionally, IRS-2<sup>−</sup><sup>/−</sup> mice also showed marked insulin resistance in adipose tissue as reflected by reduced suppression of plasma free fatty acid concentrations and glycerol turnover during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. These data suggest important tissue-specific roles for IRS-1 and IRS-2 in mediating the effect of insulin on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism<i>in vivo</i> in mice. IRS-1 appears to have its major role in muscle, whereas IRS-2 appears to impact on liver, muscle, and adipose tissue.","10.1074/jbc.m006490200","5.0","Stephen F. Previs; Dominic J.

"Expression and function of IRS-1 in insulin signal transmission.","IRS-1 is a major insulin receptor substrate which may play an important role in insulin signal transmission. The mRNA for IRS-1 in rat cells and tissues is about 9.5 kilobases (kb). Rat liver IRS-1 was stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (CHO/IRS-1). Although its calculated molecular mass is 131 kDa, IRS-1 from quiescent cells migrated between 165 and 170 kDa during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. IRS-1 was phosphorylated strongly on serine residues and weakly on threonine residues before insulin stimulation. Insulin immediately stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and after 10-30 min with insulin its apparent molecular mass increased to 175-180 kDa. Expression of the human insulin receptor and rat IRS-1 together in CHO/IR/IRS-1 cells increased the basal serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and strongly increased tyrosine phosphorylation during insulin stimulation. Purified insulin receptors directly phosphorylated baculovirus-produced IRS-1 exclusively on tyrosine residues. By immunofluorescence, IRS-1 was absent from the nucleus, but otherwise distributed uniformly before and after insulin stimulation. Some IRS-1 associated with the insulin receptor during insulin stimulation. In addition, a phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase associated with IRS-1 during insulin stimulation, and this association was more sensitive to insulin in CHO cells overexpressing the insulin receptor (CHO/IR cells), more responsive to insulin to CHO/IRS-1 cells, and both sensitive and responsive in CHO/IR/IRS-1 cells. Similarly, insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis was more sensitive to insulin in CHO/IR cells, and more responsive in CHO/IRS-1 cells; however, insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis was sensitive but poorly responsive to insulin in CHO/IR/IRS-1 cells. Together, these results suggest that IRS-1 is a direct physiologic substrate of the insulin receptor and may play an important role in insulin signal transmission.","10.1016/s0021-9258(18)41723-1","7.0","Xiao‐Jian Sun; Montserrat Miralpeix; Martin G.

"IRS-1 activates phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase by associating with src homology 2 domains of p85.","IRS-1 is an insulin receptor substrate that undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and associates with the phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3'-kinase immediately after insulin stimulation. Recombinant IRS-1 protein was tyrosine phosphorylated by the insulin receptor in vitro and associated with the PtdIns 3'-kinase from lysates of quiescent 3T3 fibroblasts. Bacterial fusion proteins containing the src homology 2 domains (SH2 domains) of the 85-kDa subunit (p85) of the PtdIns 3'-kinase bound quantitatively to tyrosine phosphorylated, but not unphosphorylated, IRS-1, and this association was blocked by phosphotyrosine-containing synthetic peptides. Moreover, the phosphorylated peptides and the SH2 domains each inhibited binding of PtdIns 3'-kinase to IRS-1. Phosphorylated IRS-1 activated PtdIns 3'-kinase in anti-p85 immunoprecipitates in vitro, and this activation was blocked by SH2 domain fusion proteins. These data suggest that the interaction between PtdIns 3'-kinase and IRS-1 is mediated by tyrosine phosphorylated motifs on IRS-1 and the SH2 domains of p85, and IRS-1 activates PtdIns 3'-kinase by binding to the SH2 domains of p85. Thus, IRS-1 likely serves to transmit the insulin signal by binding and regulating intracellular enzymes containing SH2 domains.","10.1073/pnas.89.21.10350","9.0","Martin G.

"The Role of Chance in the Census Bureau Database Reconstruction Experiment","Abstract The Census Bureau plans a new approach to disclosure control for the 2020 census that will add noise to every statistic the agency produces for places below the state level. The Bureau argues the new approach is needed because the confidentiality of census responses is threatened by “database reconstruction,” a technique for inferring individual-level responses from tabular data. The Census Bureau constructed hypothetical individual-level census responses from public 2010 tabular data and matched them to internal census records and to outside sources. The Census Bureau did not compare these results to a null model to demonstrate that their success in matching would not be expected by chance. This is analogous to conducting a clinical trial without a control group. We implement a simple simulation to assess how many matches would be expected by chance. We demonstrate that most matches reported by the Census Bureau experiment would be expected randomly. To extend the metaphor of the clinical trial, the treatment and the placebo produced similar outcomes. The database reconstruction experiment therefore fails to demonstrate a credible threat to confidentiality.","10.1007/s11113-021-09674-3","2.0","Steven Ruggles; David Van Riper","2021.0","","","chance; census; bureau; database; reconstruction; experiment"
"Use of Census-based Aggregate Variables to Proxy for Socioeconomic Group: Evidence from National Samples","Increasingly, investigators append census-based socioeconomic characteristics of residential areas to individual records to address the problem of inadequate socioeconomic information on health data sets. Little empirical attention has been given to the validity of this approach. The authors estimate health outcome equations using samples from nationally representative data sets linked to census data. They investigate whether statistical power is sensitive to the timing of census data collection or to the level of aggregation of the census data; whether different census items are conceptually distinct; and whether the use of multiple aggregate measures in health outcome equations improves prediction compared with a single aggregate measure. The authors find little difference in estimates when using 1970 compared with 1980 US Bureau of the Census data or zip code compared with tract level variables. However, aggregate variables are highly multicollinear. Associations of health outcomes with aggregate measures are substantially weaker than with microlevel measures. The authors conclude that aggregate measures can not be interpreted as if they were microlevel variables nor should a specific aggregate measure be interpreted to represent the effects of what it is labeled.

"Identification of IRS-1 Ser-1101 as a target of S6K1 in nutrient- and obesity-induced insulin resistance","S6K1 has emerged as a critical signaling component in the development of insulin resistance through phosphorylation and inhibition of IRS-1 function. This effect can be triggered directly by nutrients such as amino acids or by insulin through a homeostatic negative-feedback loop. However, the role of S6K1 in mediating IRS-1 phosphorylation in a physiological setting of nutrient overload is unresolved. Here we show that S6K1 directly phosphorylates IRS-1 Ser-1101 in vitro in the C-terminal domain of the protein and that mutation of this site largely blocks the ability of amino acids to suppress IRS-1 tyrosine and Akt phosphorylation. Consistent with this finding, phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser-1101 is increased in the liver of obese db/db and wild-type, but not S6K1(-/-), mice maintained on a high-fat diet and is blocked by siRNA knockdown of S6K1 protein. Finally, infusion of amino acids in humans leads to the concomitant activation of S6K1, phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser-1101, a reduction in IRS-1 function, and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. These findings indicate that nutrient- and hormonal-dependent activation of S6K1 causes insulin resistance in mice and humans, in part, by mediating IRS-1 Ser-1101 phosphorylation.","10.1073/pnas.0706517104","11.0","Frédéric Tremblay; Sophie Brûlé; Sung Hee Um; Yu Li; Kohei Masuda; Michael Roden; Xiao‐Jian Sun; Michael Krebs; Roberto D.

"IRS-1: Essential for Insulin- and IL-4-Stimulated Mitogenesis in Hematopoietic Cells","Although several interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent cell lines proliferate in response to IL-4 or insulin, the 32D line does not. Insulin and IL-4 sensitivity was restored to 32D cells by expression of IRS-1, the principal substrate of the insulin receptor. Although 32D cells possessed receptors for both factors, they lacked the IRS-1--related protein, 4PS, which becomes phosphorylated by tyrosine in insulin- or IL-4--responsive lines after stimulation. These results indicate that factors that bind unrelated receptors can use similar mitogenic signaling pathways in hematopoietic cells and that 4PS and IRS-1 are functionally similar proteins that are essential for insulin- and IL-4--induced proliferation.","10.1126/science.8372354","6.0","Ling-Mei Wang; Martin G.

"The virtual census: representations of gender, race and age in video games","A large-scale content analysis of characters in video games was employed to answer questions about their representations of gender, race and age in comparison to the US population. The sample included 150 games from a year across nine platforms, with the results weighted according to game sales. This innovation enabled the results to be analyzed in proportion to the games that were actually played by the public, and thus allowed the first statements able to be generalized about the content of popular video games. The results show a systematic over-representation of males, white and adults and a systematic under-representation of females, Hispanics, Native Americans, children and the elderly. Overall, the results are similar to those found in television research. The implications for identity, cognitive models, cultivation and game research are discussed.","10.1177/1461444809105354","4.0","Dmitri Williams; Nicole Martins; Mia Consalvo; James Ivory","2009.0","","","census; representations; gender; race; age; video; games"
"Cellular Census: Explorations in Urban Data Collection","Much of our understanding of urban systems comes from traditional data collection methods such as surveys by person or phone. These approaches can provide detailed information about urban behaviors, but they're hard to update and might limit results to ""snapshots in time."" In the past few years, some innovative approaches have sought to use mobile devices to collect spatiotemporal data. But little research has been done to develop and analyze the much larger samples of existing data generated daily by mobile networks. The most common explanation for this is that the challenge of data-sharing with the telecommunications industry has hampered data access. However, in early 2006, a collaboration between Telecom Italia, which serves 40 percent of the Roman market, and MIT's SKNSEable City Laboratory (http://senseable.mit.edu) allowed unprecedented access to aggregate mobile phone data from Rome. Here, we explore how researchers might be able to use data for an entire metropolitan region to analyze urban dynamics.","10.1109/mprv.2007.53","4.0","Jonathan Reades; Francesco Calabrese; Andres Sevtsuk; Carlo Ratti","2007.0","","","census; explorations; urban; collection"
"Census error and the detection of density dependence","Summary Studies aiming to identify the prevalence and nature of density dependence in ecological populations have often used statistical analysis of ecological time‐series of population counts. Such time‐series are also being used increasingly to parameterize models that may be used in population management. If time‐series contain measurement errors, tests that rely on detecting a negative relationship between log population change and population size are biased and prone to spuriously detecting density dependence (Type I error). This is because the measurement error in density for a given year appears in the corresponding change in population density, with equal magnitude but opposite sign. This effect introduces bias that may invalidate comparisons of ecological data with density‐independent time‐series. Unless census error can be accounted for, time‐series may appear to show strongly density‐dependent dynamics, even though the density‐dependent signal may in reality be weak or absent. We distinguish two forms of census error, both of which have serious consequences for detecting density dependence. First, estimates of population density are based rarely on exact counts, but on samples. Hence there exists sampling error, with the level of error depending on the method employed and the number of replicates on which the population estimate is based. Secondly, the group of organisms measured is often not a truly self‐contained population, but part of a wider ecological population, defined in terms of location or behaviour. Consequently, the subpopulation studied may effectively be a sample of the population and spurious density dependence may be detected in the dynamics of a single subpopulation. In this case, density dependence is detected erroneously, even if numbers within the subpopulation are censused without sampling error. In order to illustrate how process variation and measurement error may be distinguished we review data sets (counts of numbers of birds by single observers) for which both census error and long‐term variance in population density can be estimated. Tests for density dependence need to obviate the problem that measured population sizes are typically estimates rather than exact counts. It is possible that in some cases it may be possible to test for density dependence in the presence of unknown levels of census error, for example by uncovering nonlinearities in the density response. However, it seems likely that these may lack power compared with analyses that are able to explicitly include census error and we review some recently developed methods.","10.1111/j.1365-2656.2006.01121.x","4.0","Robert P.

"Using Environmental DNA to Census Marine Fishes in a Large Mesocosm","The ocean is a soup of its resident species' genetic material, cast off in the forms of metabolic waste, shed skin cells, or damaged tissue. Sampling this environmental DNA (eDNA) is a potentially powerful means of assessing whole biological communities, a significant advance over the manual methods of environmental sampling that have historically dominated marine ecology and related fields. Here, we estimate the vertebrate fauna in a 4.5-million-liter mesocosm aquarium tank at the Monterey Bay Aquarium of known species composition by sequencing the eDNA from its constituent seawater. We find that it is generally possible to detect mitochondrial DNA of bony fishes sufficient to identify organisms to taxonomic family- or genus-level using a 106 bp fragment of the 12S ribosomal gene. Within bony fishes, we observe a low false-negative detection rate, although we did not detect the cartilaginous fishes or sea turtles present with this fragment. We find that the rank abundance of recovered eDNA sequences correlates with the abundance of corresponding species' biomass in the mesocosm, but the data in hand do not allow us to develop a quantitative relationship between biomass and eDNA abundance. Finally, we find a low false-positive rate for detection of exogenous eDNA, and we were able to diagnose non-native species' tissue in the food used to maintain the mesocosm, underscoring the sensitivity of eDNA as a technique for community-level ecological surveys. We conclude that eDNA has substantial potential to become a core tool for environmental monitoring, but that a variety of challenges remain before reliable quantitative assessments of ecological communities in the field become possible.","10.1371/journal.pone.0086175","4.0","Ryan P.

Under the leadership of Steven J. Jost, associate director for communications, the U.S. Census Bureau leveraged emerging technologies during the 2010 Census to complete the project under budget while also engaging citizens through the design of viable participatory platforms. The 2010 Census campaign focused on increasing response rates and encouraging citizen participation through innovations in the communication process with citizens and through the infusion of technology. The Census Bureau also effectively managed risks associated with the use of emerging technologies.

"Energy-Efficient Design of IRS-NOMA Networks","Combining intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is an effective solution to enhance communication coverage and energy efficiency. In this paper, we focus on an IRS-assisted NOMA network and propose an energy-efficient algorithm to yield a good tradeoff between the sum-rate maximization and total power consumption minimization. We aim to maximize the system energy efficiency by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming at the BS and the reflecting beamforming at the IRS. Specifically, the transmit beamforming and the phases of the low-cost passive elements on the IRS are alternatively optimized until the convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm in IRS-NOMA can yield superior performance compared with the conventional OMA-IRS and NOMA with a random phase IRS.","10.1109/tvt.2020.3024005","4.0","Fang Fang; Yanqing Xu; Quoc‐Viet Pham; Zhiguo Ding","2020.0","","","energy; efficient; irs; noma; networks"

"The IRS-signalling system during insulin and cytokine action","The discovery of the first intracellular substrate for insulin, IRS-1, redirected the field of diabetes research and has led to many important advances in our understanding of insulin action. Detailed analysis of IRS-1 demonstrates structure/function relationships for this modular docking molecule, including mechanisms of substrate recognition and signal propagation. Recent work has also identified other structurally similar molecules, including IRS-2, the Drosophila protein, DOS, and the Grb2-binding protein, Gab1, suggesting that this intracellular signalling strategy is conserved evolutionarily and is utilized by an expanding number of receptor systems. In fact, IRS-1 itself has been shown to be important in other growth factor and cytokine signalling systems, including growth hormone and several interleukins. Analysis of mice lacking IRS-1 confirms an important physiological role for this protein in glucose metabolism and general cell growth in the intact animal. Disregulation of the signalling pathways integrated by the IRS proteins may contribute to the pathophysiology of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or other diseases.","10.1002/bies.950190608","2.0","Lynne Yenush; Morris F.

"A Census of Baryons in Galaxy Clusters and Groups","We determine the contribution of stars in galaxies, intracluster stars, and the intracluster medium to the total baryon budget in nearby galaxy clusters and groups. We find that the baryon mass fraction (f_b) within r500 is constant for systems with M500 between 6e13 and 1e15 Msun. Although f_b is lower than the WMAP value, the shortfall is on the order of both the observational systematic uncertainties and the depletion of baryons within r500 that is predicted by simulations. The data therefore provide no compelling evidence for undetected baryonic components, particularly any that vary in importance with cluster mass. A unique feature of the current analysis is direct inclusion of the contribution of intracluster light (ICL) in the baryon budget. The increase in X-ray gas mass fraction with increasing total mass is entirely accounted for by a decrease in the total stellar mass fraction, supporting the argument that the behavior of both the stellar and X-ray gas components is dominated by a decrease in star formation efficiency in more massive environments. Within just the stellar component, the fraction of the total stellar luminosity in the BCG and ICL decreases as velocity dispersion increases, suggesting that the BCG+ICL component, and in particular the dominant ICL component, grows less efficiently in higher mass environments. The degree to which this behavior arises from our sample selection, which favored systems with central, giant elliptical galaxies, remains unclear. A more robust result is the identification of low mass groups with large BCG+ICL components, demonstrating that the creation of intracluster stars does not require a massive cluster environment. Within r500 and r200, the BCG+ICL contributes on average 40% and 33% of the total stellar light, respectively.","10.1086/519729","3.0","Anthony H. Gonzalez; Dennis Zaritsky; Ann I.

"Changing Race: Latinos, the Census, and the History of Ethnicity in the United States","Figures just released from the 2000 U.S. Census reveal what demographers have predicted for the past decade: Latinos are surpassing African Americans as the country’s largest minority group. Yet because of differences in national origin, physical appearance, historical memory, class, and religion, no single group identity exists for this rapidly growing population. In part because of this diversity, in the 2000 Census, respondents, for the first time, could select more than one racial category. Clara Rodríguez’s newest work on Latinos in the U.S. examines difficulties in categorizing this group as part of a broader discussion of ethnicity and race in the United States. She chose as her lens the U.S. Census Bureau because census categories and definitions reveal a society’s “dominant ideals and beliefs” (p. xiv) and such definitions shape how peoples and individuals see themselves and others. Rodríguez’s aim is to demonstrate through the Latino experience that race is not fixed; it is “imperfectly measured” and can lead to discrimination and misunderstanding. A sociologist by training, Rodríguez draws upon her own experiences as a Latina, on interviews, analyses of census data, and secondary works from a variety of disciplines.The difficulty in classifying Latinos underscores one of Rodríguez’s main points: definitions of race and ethnicity are subjective and dependent on context. Some public agencies consider Latinos a race, but the Bureau of the Census does not (a topic to which the author devotes ample space). Rodríguez argues that most in the U.S. conflate race and ethnicity, and see race as genetically determined and fixed (as evidenced by Census Bureau efforts to make Latinos and other groups fit the bipolar racial categories of white and non-white). Meanwhile, for Latinos, race and ethnicity are culturally determined, fluid, and contextual. As Rodríguez explains, these divergent notions of race and ethnicity came out of our respective historical experiences.Rodríguez describes the evolution of the U.S.’s bipolar racial paradigm by tracing the Census Bureau’s two-hundred-year history of shifting categories and criteria. She ably links changing racial definitions over time to broader social and political factors, and sees the Bureau’s recent efforts to more accurately categorize Hispanics as evidence that notions of race and ethnicity are undergoing further adjustment in this country.This broad treatment of Latino identity and U.S. efforts to categorize its diverse populations will complement the plethora of new works on the Latino experience in the U.S. It should prove useful also to historians of race and ethnicity in America. While Rodríguez’s arguments are somewhat disorganized and repetitive, the redundancy permits the use of individual chapters for teaching purposes. Further, although little new scholarship appears here, the author provides a relatively thorough review of the literature on issues such as Latino identity formation and acculturation. In addition, Rodríguez’s history of Census activities is also quite thorough, and the book is richly documented. Those seeking more on the historical development of notions of race and ethnicity in Latin America will no doubt be disappointed, however, given the outdated and limited resources consulted. Perhaps the real value of this work is the perspective it offers on how Latinos in this country have been perceived and how they perceive themselves. It is likely that this population group will prove quite instrumental in reshaping our ideas of race and ethnicity.","10.1215/00182168-81-3-4-774","1.0","Elaine C.

"Status of the phylogenetic diversity census of ruminal microbiomes","In this study, the collective microbial diversity in the rumen was examined by performing a meta-analysis of all the curated 16S rRNA gene (rrn) sequences deposited in the RDP database. As of November 2010, 13,478 bacterial and 3516 archaeal rrn sequences were found. The bacterial sequences were assigned to 5271 operation taxonomic units (OTUs) at species level (0.03 phylogenetic distance) representing 19 existing phyla, of which the Firmicutes (2958 OTUs), Bacteroidetes (1610 OTUs) and Proteobacteria (226 OTUs) were the most predominant. These bacterial sequences were grouped into more than 3500 OTUs at genus level (0.05 distance), but only 180 existing genera were represented. Nearly all the archaeal sequences were assigned to 943 species-level OTUs in phylum Euryarchaeota. Although clustered into 670 genus-level OTUs, only 12 existing archaeal genera were represented. Based on rarefaction analysis, the current percent coverage at species level reached 71% for bacteria and 65% for archaea. At least 78,218 bacterial and 24,480 archaeal sequences would be needed to reach 99.9% coverage. The results of this study may serve as a framework to assess the significance of individual populations to rumen functions and to guide future studies to identify the alpha and global diversity of ruminal microbiomes.","10.1111/j.1574-6941.2010.01029.x","3.0","Minseok Kim; Mark Morrison; Zhongtang Yu","2011.0","","","status; diversity; census; microbiomes"

"Genetic Analysis of the IRS","Abstract Insulin resistance is part of a metabolic syndrome that also includes non–insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, obesity, and hypertension. It has been hypothesized that insulin resistance represents the primary physiological defect underlying this syndrome. Since insulin resistance is at least partially genetically determined, we hypothesized that genes influencing insulin resistance would have pleiotropic effects on a number of other traits, including triglyceride (TG) and HDL cholesterol levels, body mass index (BMI) and body fat distribution, and blood pressure levels. To investigate this hypothesis, we analyzed data obtained from individuals in 41 families enrolled in the San Antonio Family Heart Study. Statistical methods that take advantage of the relatedness among individuals were used to differentiate between genetic and nongenetic (ie, environmental) contributions to phenotypic variation between traits. Serum levels of fasting and 2-hour insulin (measured in 767 and 743 nondiabetic family members, respectively) were used as a measure of insulin resistance. The genetic correlations were high between insulin levels (both fasting and 2-hour) and each of the following: BMI, HDL level, waist-to-hip ratio, and subscapular-to-triceps ratio, indicating that the same gene, or set of genes, influences each pair of traits. In contrast, the genetic correlations of insulin levels with systolic and diastolic blood pressures were low. We have previously shown that a single diallelic locus accounts for 31% of the phenotypic variation in 2-hour insulin levels in this population. We conducted a bivariate segregation analysis to see if the common genetic effects on insulin and these other traits could be attributable to this single locus. These results indicated a significant effect of the 2-hour insulin locus on fasting insulin levels ( P =.02) and BMI ( P =.05), with the “high” insulin allele associated with higher levels of fasting insulin but lower levels of BMI. There was no detectable effect of this locus on HDL level, TG level, subscapular-to-triceps ratio, or blood pressure. Overall, these results suggest that a common set of genes influencing insulin levels also influences other insulin resistance syndrome–related traits, although for the most part this pleiotropy is not attributable to the 2-hour insulin level major locus.","10.1161/01.atv.16.2.281","9.0","Braxton D.

"Ser/Thr Phosphorylation of IRS Proteins: A Molecular Basis for Insulin Resistance","S6K1, like other serine and threonine kinases activated by insulin (such as mTOR and PKCzeta), has recently been shown to participate in negative feedback mechanisms aimed at terminating insulin signaling through IRS (insulin receptor substrate) phosphorylation. Such homeostatic mechanisms can also be activated by excess nutrients or inducers of insulin resistance (such as fatty acids and proinflammatory cytokines) to produce an insulin-resistant state that often leads to the development of diabetes. Identification of the specific kinases involved in such insulin resistance pathways can help lead to the rational design of novel therapeutic agents for treating insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.","10.1126/stke.2682005pe4","1.0","Yehiel Zick","2005.0","","","ser; thr; phosphorylation; irs; basis; insulin; resistance"

"USING THE P90/P10 INDEX TO MEASURE U.S. INEQUALITY TRENDS WITH CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY DATA: A VIEW FROM INSIDE THE CENSUS BUREAU VAULTS","The March Current Population Survey (CPS) is the primary data source for estimation of levels and trends in U.S. earnings and income inequality. However, time‐inconsistency problems related to top coding lead many CPS users to measure inequality via the ratio of the 90th to the 10th percentile (P90/P10) rather than by more traditional summary measures. With access to public use and restricted‐access internal CPS data, and by applying bounding methods, we show that using P90/P10 does not completely obviate time‐inconsistency problems, especially in capturing household income inequality trends. Using internal data, we create consistent cell mean values for all top‐coded public use values that, when used with public use data, closely track inequality trends in earnings and household income using internal data. But estimates of longer‐term inequality trends with these corrected data based on P90/P10 differ from those based on the Gini coefficient. The choice of inequality measure still matters.","10.1111/j.1475-4991.2008.00305.x","3.0","Richard V. Burkhauser; Shuaizhang Feng; Stephen P.

"Integrating Mark-Recapture-Recovery and Census Data to Estimate Animal Abundance and Demographic Parameters","Summary. In studies of wild animals, one frequently encounters both census and mark-recapture-recovery data. We show how a state-space model for census data in combination with the usual multinomial-based models for ring-recovery data provide estimates of productivity not available from either type of data alone. The approach is illustrated on two British bird species. For the lapwing, we calibrate how its recent decline could be due to a decrease in productivity. For the heron, there is no evidence for a decline in productivity, and the combined analysis increases significantly the strength of logistic regressions of survival on winter severity.","10.1111/j.0006-341x.2002.00540.x","4.0","Panagiotis Besbeas; Stephen N.

"Insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1 is reduced and IRS-2 is the main docking protein for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in adipocytes from subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus","The large docking protein IRS-1 is a major substrate for the insulin receptor and other tyrosine kinases. It plays a key role in eliciting many of insulin’s actions, including binding and activation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and the subsequent increase in glucose transport. Gene disruption of IRS-1 in mice is associated with an impaired insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in vivo and glucose transport in vitro , but the survival of the animals and residual insulin sensitivity is dependent on the presence of the alternative docking protein IRS-2. We examined the expression and function of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in adipocytes from healthy and diabetic individuals. Cells from subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), but not with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, had an impaired insulin effect and a marked reduction (70 ± 6%) in the expression of IRS-1 protein, whereas IRS-2 was unchanged. In normal cells, IRS-1 was the main docking protein for the binding and activation of insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase; IRS-2 was also functional but required a higher insulin concentration for a similar binding and activation of PI 3-kinase. In contrast in NIDDM cells with a low IRS-1 content, IRS-2 became the main docking protein. These findings may provide important reasons for the insulin resistance in NIDDM.","10.1073/pnas.94.8.4171","6.0","Cristina M. Rondinone; Ling-Mei Wang; Peter Lönnroth; Christian Wesslau; Jacalyn H.

"THE BARYON CENSUS IN A MULTIPHASE INTERGALACTIC MEDIUM: 30% OF THE BARYONS MAY STILL BE MISSING","Although galaxies, groups, and clusters contain ∼10% of the baryons, many more reside in the photoionized and shocked-heated intergalactic medium (IGM) and in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). We update the baryon census in the (H i) Lyα forest and warm-hot IGM (WHIM) at 105–6 K traced by O vi λ1032, 1038 absorption. From Enzo cosmological simulations of heating, cooling, and metal transport, we improve the H i and O vi baryon surveys using spatially averaged corrections for metallicity (Z/Z☉) and ionization fractions (fH i, fO vi). Statistically, the O vi correction product correlates with column density, (Z/Z☉)fO vi ≈ (0.015)(NO vi/1014 cm−2)0.70, with an NO vi-weighted mean of 0.01, which doubles previous estimates of WHIM baryon content. We also update the Lyα forest contribution to baryon density out to z = 0.4, correcting for the (1 + z)3 increase in absorber density, the (1 + z)4.4 rise in photoionizing background, and cosmological proper length dℓ/dz. We find substantial baryon fractions in the photoionized Lyα forest (28% ± 11%) and WHIM traced by O vi and broad-Lyα absorbers (25% ± 8%). The collapsed phase (galaxies, groups, clusters, CGM) contains 18% ± 4%, leaving an apparent baryon shortfall of 29% ± 13%. Our simulations suggest that ∼15% reside in hotter WHIM (T ⩾ 106 K). Additional baryons could be detected in weaker Lyα and O vi absorbers. Further progress requires higher-precision baryon surveys of weak absorbers, down to minimum column densities NH i ⩾ 1012.0 cm−2, NO vi ⩾ 1012.5 cm−2, NO vii ⩾ 1014.5 cm−2, using high signal-to-noise data from high-resolution UV and X-ray spectrographs.","10.1088/0004-637x/759/1/23","3.0","J.

This article presents improvements made in the fourth version of the Gridded Population of the World (GPWv4) data set. GPWv4 is a minimally modeled data set that uses uniform distribution to disaggregate census data from their native input units into a thirty arc-second global grid. Due to an increase in freely accessible census data from the 2010 round of censuses, eighty-seven countries are gridded at a higher administrative level than in the previous version, with a more than fivefold increase in the total number of census units outside of the United States. The resultant decrease in unit size has greatly improved the data set accuracy. Additionally, version 4 has expanded to include grids of age, sex, and urban–rural status. Obtaining high-resolution census data and matching census geography remains a priority for improving global gridded population data sets.","10.1080/23754931.2015.1014272","7.0","Erin Doxsey-Whitfield; Kytt MacManus; Susana B.

"Sum Rate Maximization for IRS-Assisted Uplink NOMA","An intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) consists of a large number of low-cost reflecting elements, which can steer the incident signal collaboratively by passive beamforming. This way, IRS reconfigures the wireless environment to boost the system performance. In this paper, we consider an IRS-assisted uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system. The objective is to maximize the sum rate of all users under individual power constraint. The considered problem requires a joint power control at the users and beamforming design at the IRS, and is nonconvex. To handle it, semidefinite relaxation is employed, which provides a near-optimal solution. Presented numerical results show that the proposed NOMA-based scheme achieves a larger sum rate than orthogonal multiple access (OMA)-based one. Moreover, the impact of the number of reflecting elements on the sum rate is revealed.","10.1109/lcomm.2020.3025978","5.0","Ming Zeng; Xingwang Li; Gen Li; Wanming Hao; Octavia A.

"A census of membrane-bound and intracellular signal transduction proteins in bacteria: Bacterial IQ, extroverts and introverts","Abstract Background Analysis of complete microbial genomes showed that intracellular parasites and other microorganisms that inhabit stable ecological niches encode relatively primitive signaling systems, whereas environmental microorganisms typically have sophisticated systems of environmental sensing and signal transduction. Results This paper presents results of a comprehensive census of signal transduction proteins – histidine kinases, methyl-accepting chemotaxis receptors, Ser/Thr/Tyr protein kinases, adenylate and diguanylate cyclases and c-di-GMP phosphodiesterases – encoded in 167 bacterial and archaeal genomes, sequenced by the end of 2004. The data have been manually checked to avoid false-negative and false-positive hits that commonly arise during large-scale automated analyses and compared against other available resources. The census data show uneven distribution of most signaling proteins among bacterial and archaeal phyla. The total number of signal transduction proteins grows approximately as a square of genome size. While histidine kinases are found in representatives of all phyla and are distributed according to the power law, other signal transducers are abundant in certain phylogenetic groups but virtually absent in others. Conclusion The complexity of signaling systems differs even among closely related organisms. Still, it usually can be correlated with the phylogenetic position of the organism, its lifestyle, and typical environmental challenges it encounters. The number of encoded signal transducers (or their fraction in the total protein set) can be used as a measure of the organism's ability to adapt to diverse conditions, the 'bacterial IQ', while the ratio of transmembrane receptors to intracellular sensors can be used to define whether the organism is an 'extrovert', actively sensing the environmental parameters, or an 'introvert', more concerned about its internal homeostasis. Some of the microorganisms with the highest IQ, including the current leader Wolinella succinogenes , are found among the poorly studied beta-, delta- and epsilon-proteobacteria. Among all bacterial phyla, only cyanobacteria appear to be true introverts, probably due to their capacity to conduct oxygenic photosynthesis, using a complex system of intracellular membranes. The census data, available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Complete_Genomes/SignalCensus.html , can be used to get an insight into metabolic and behavioral propensities of each given organism and improve prediction of the organism's properties based solely on its genome sequence.","10.1186/1471-2180-5-35","1.0","Michael Y.

"A census of Tandem system availability between 1985 and 1990","A census of customer outages reported to Tandem showing a clear improvement in the reliability of hardware and maintenance has been taken. It indicates that software is now the major source of reported outages (62%), followed by system operations (15%). This is a dramatic shift from the statistics for 1985. Even after discounting systematic underreporting of operations and environmental outages, the conclusion is clear: hardware faults and hardware maintenance are no longer a major source of outages. As the other components of the system become increasingly reliable, software necessarily becomes the dominant cause of outages. Achieving higher availability requires improvement in software quality and software fault tolerance, simpler operations, and tolerance of operational faults.< <ETX xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">&gt;</ETX>","10.1109/24.58719","1.0","Jodi Gray","1990.0","","","census; tandem; availability"

"Effective/census population size ratio estimation: a compendium and appraisal","Abstract With an ecological‐evolutionary perspective increasingly applied toward the conservation and management of endangered or exploited species, the genetic estimation of effective population size ( N e ) has proliferated. Based on a comprehensive analysis of empirical literature from the past two decades, we asked: (i) how often do studies link N e to the adult census population size ( N )? (ii) To what extent is N e correctly linked to N ? (iii) How readily is uncertainty accounted for in both N e and N when quantifying N e / N ratios? and (iv) how frequently and to what degree might errors in the estimation of N e or N affect inferences of N e / N ratios? We found that only 20% of available N e estimates (508 of 2617; 233 studies) explicitly attempted to link N e and N ; of these, only 31% (160 of 508) correctly linked N e and N . Moreover, only 7% (41 of 508) of N e / N ratios (correctly linked or not) reported confidence intervals for both N e and N ; for those cases where confidence intervals were reported for N e only, 31% of N e / N ratios overlapped with 1, of which more than half also reached below N e / N = 0.01. Uncertainty in N e /N ratios thus sometimes spanned at least two orders of magnitude. We conclude that the estimation of N e / N ratios in natural populations could be significantly improved, discuss several options for doing so, and briefly outline some future research directions.","10.1002/ece3.329","2.0","Friso Palstra; Dylan J.

"Power Efficient IRS-Assisted NOMA","In this paper, we propose a downlink multiple-input single-output (MISO) transmission scheme, which is assisted by an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) consisting of a large number of passive reflecting elements. In the literature, it has been proved that nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can achieve the same performance as computationally complex dirty paper coding, where the quasi-degradation condition is satisfied, conditioned on the users' channels fall in the quasi-degradation region. However, in a conventional communication scenario, it is difficult to guarantee the quasi-degradation, because the channels are determined by the propagation environments and cannot be reconfigured. To overcome this difficulty, we focus on an IRS-assisted MISO NOMA system, where the wireless channels can be effectively tuned. We optimize the beamforming vectors and the IRS phase shift matrix for minimizing transmission power. Furthermore, we propose an improved quasi-degradation condition by using IRS, which can ensure that NOMA achieves the capacity region with high possibility. For a comparison, we study zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) as well, where the beamforming vectors and the IRS phase shift matrix are also jointly optimized. Comparing NOMA with ZFBF, it is shown that, with the same IRS phase shift matrix and the improved quasi-degradation condition, NOMA always outperforms ZFBF. At the same time, we identify the condition under which ZFBF outperforms NOMA, which motivates the proposed hybrid NOMA transmission. Simulation results show that the proposed IRS-assisted MISO system outperforms the MISO case without IRS, and the hybrid NOMA transmission scheme always achieves better performance than orthogonal multiple access.","10.1109/tcomm.2020.3029617","5.0","Jianyue Zhu; Yongming Huang; Jiaheng Wang; Keivan Navaie; Zhiguo Ding","2020.0","","","power; efficient; irs; assisted; noma"
"Spatial and temporal variation of biomass in a tropical forest: results from a large census plot in Panama","Summary We estimated the dry, living, above‐ground biomass (AGB) standing stock and its turnover in a 50‐hectare forest plot located in moist tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The estimates were obtained using inventory data collected every 5 years from 1985 to 2000, including measurements of all trees ≥ 1 cm diameter. Four different allometric regressions relating trunk diameter and height with AGB were compared. Based on the most consistent method, we estimated that the Barro Colorado forest holds 281 ± 20 Mg ha −1 (1 Mg = 10 3 kg) of AGB, lianas included. A third of the AGB is stored in trees larger than 70 cm in diameter. Stand‐level AGB increment (growth plus recruitment) was highest in the period 1985–90 (7.05 ± 0.32 Mg ha −1 year −1 , mean ± 95% confidence limits based on samples of multiple hectares) and smallest in the period 1990–95 (5.25 ± 0.26 Mg ha −1 year −1 ), while AGB losses were similar during the three intervals (mean 5.43 ± 0.72 Mg ha −1 year −1 ). This resulted in significant differences in AGB change (defined as increment minus loss) among census intervals; including branchfalls, the AGB of Barro Colorado Island increased in 1985–90 (+0.82 ± 0.84 Mg ha −1 year −1 ), decreased in 1990–95 (−0.69 ± 0.82 Mg ha −1 year −1 ), and increased again in 1995–2000 (+0.45 ± 0.70 Mg ha −1 year −1 ). The 15‐year average was +0.20 Mg ha −1 year −1 , but with a confidence interval that spanned zero (−0.68 to 0.63 Mg ha −1 year −1 ). Branchfalls and partial breakage of stems had a significant influence on the AGB changes. They contributed an average of 0.46 Mg ha −1 year −1 to the AGB loss. About 5% of AGB increment was due to trees less than 10 cm in diameter. To test whether the AGB of tropical forests is increasing due to climate change, we propose that in each forest type, at least 10 hectares of forest be inventoried, and that measurements of the small classes (&lt; 10 cm diameter) as well as large size classes be included. Biomass loss due to crown damage should also be estimated.","10.1046/j.1365-2745.2003.00757.x","6.0","Jérôme Chave; Richard Condit; Suzanne Lao; John P. Caspersen; Robin B. Foster; Stephen P.

"IRS proteins and beta-cell function.","Insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins mediate a variety of the metabolic and growth-promoting actions of insulin and IGF-1. After phosphorylation by activated receptors, these intracellular signaling molecules recruit various downstream effector pathways including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Grb2. Ablation of the IRS-2 gene produces a diabetic phenotype; mice lacking IRS-2 display peripheral insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction characterized by a 50% reduction in beta-cell mass. In contrast, deletion of IRS-1 retards somatic growth and enhances beta-cell mass. IRS1-/- mice are 50% smaller than controls but have a twofold increase in pancreatic beta-cell mass. Thus, observations from these recently developed animal models implicate the IRS signaling systems in the response of classical insulin target tissues, and they suggest a critical role for these proteins in the regulation of beta-cell function. In humans, type 2 diabetes generally occurs when insulin-secretory reserves fail to compensate for peripheral insulin resistance. Study and identification of the signals downstream of IRS proteins in beta-cells may provide unique insights into the compensatory mechanisms by which these cells respond to insulin resistance. Therefore, the intent of this review is to summarize recent observations regarding the regulation of beta-cell function by members of the IRS protein family.","10.2337/diabetes.50.2007.s140","2.0","D.

"Census of the Bacterial Community of the Gypsy Moth Larval Midgut by Using Culturing and Culture-Independent Methods","ABSTRACT Little is known about bacteria associated with Lepidoptera, the large group of mostly phytophagous insects comprising the moths and butterflies. We inventoried the larval midgut bacteria of a polyphagous foliivore, the gypsy moth ( Lymantria dispar L.), whose gut is highly alkaline, by using traditional culturing and culture-independent methods. We also examined the effects of diet on microbial composition. Analysis of individual third-instar larvae revealed a high degree of similarity of microbial composition among insects fed on the same diet. DNA sequence analysis indicated that most of the PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes belong to the γ- Proteobacteria and low G+C gram-positive divisions and that the cultured members represented more than half of the phylotypes identified. Less frequently detected taxa included members of the α- Proteobacterium , Actinobacterium , and Cytophaga / Flexibacter / Bacteroides divisions. The 16S rRNA gene sequences from 7 of the 15 cultured organisms and 8 of the 9 sequences identified by PCR amplification diverged from previously reported bacterial sequences. The microbial composition of midguts differed substantially among larvae feeding on a sterilized artificial diet, aspen, larch, white oak, or willow. 16S rRNA analysis of cultured isolates indicated that an Enterococcus species and culture-independent analysis indicated that an Entbacter sp. were both present in all larvae, regardless of the feeding substrate; the sequences of these two phylotypes varied less than 1% among individual insects. These results provide the first comprehensive description of the microbial diversity of a lepidopteran midgut and demonstrate that the plant species in the diet influences the composition of the gut bacterial community.","10.1128/aem.70.1.293-300.2004","4.0","Nichole A.

"Explaining South Africa's Racial Census","In all South African elections since 1994, race has been an overwhelming predictor of voting behavior for most of the South African electorate. This paper evaluates three explanations for this outcome: an expressive hypothesis, which sees voting as an act of identity expression; a politics-as-usual approach, which points to standard factors like policy preferences or performance evaluations; and a racial heuristics approach, which suggests that voters use race as a cognitive shortcut during elections. It finds that racial heuristics, combined with performance evaluations, provide the best explanation for South Africa's racial census.","10.1111/j.1468-2508.2006.00471.x","1.0","Karen E.

"Interpolating U.S. Decennial Census Tract Data from as Early as 1970 to 2010: A Longitudinal Tract Database","Differences in the reporting units of data from diverse sources and changes in units over time are common obstacles to analysis of areal data. We compare common approaches to this problem in the context of changes over time in the boundaries of U.S. census tracts. In every decennial census many tracts are split, consolidated, or changed in other ways from the previous boundaries to reflect population growth or decline. We examine two interpolation methods to create a bridge between years, one that relies only on areal weighting and another that also introduces population weights. Results demonstrate that these approaches produce substantially different estimates for variables that involve population counts, but they have a high degree of convergence for variables defined as rates or averages. Finally the paper describes the Longitudinal Tract Data Base (LTDB), through which we are making available public-use tools to implement these methods to create estimates within 2010 tract boundaries for any tract-level data (from the census or other sources) that are available for prior years as early as 1970.","10.1080/00330124.2014.905156","3.0","John Logan; Zengwang Xu; Brian J.

"A census of glutamine/asparagine-rich regions: Implications for their conserved function and the prediction of novel prions","Glutamine/asparagine (Q/N)-rich domains have a high propensity to form self-propagating amyloid fibrils. This phenomenon underlies both prion-based inheritance in yeast and aggregation of a number of proteins involved in human neurodegenerative diseases. To examine the prevalence of this phenomenon, complete proteomic sequences of 31 organisms and several incomplete proteomic sequences were examined for Q/N-rich regions. We found that Q/N-rich regions are essentially absent from the thermophilic bacterial and archaeal proteomes. Moreover, the average Q/N content of the proteins in these organisms is markedly lower than in mesophilic bacteria and eukaryotes. Mesophilic bacterial proteomes contain a small number (0-4) of proteins with Q/N-rich regions. Remarkably, Q/N-rich domains are found in a much larger number of eukaryotic proteins (107-472 per proteome) with diverse biochemical functions. Analyses of these regions argue they have been evolutionarily selected perhaps as modular ""polar zipper"" protein-protein interaction domains. These data also provide a large pool of potential novel prion-forming proteins, two of which have recently been shown to behave as prions in yeast, thus suggesting that aggregation or prion-like regulation of protein function may be a normal regulatory process for many eukaryotic proteins with a wide variety of functions.","10.1073/pnas.97.22.11910","2.0","Melissa D.

"Racial classifications in the US census: 1890–1990","Abstract This article examines racial classifications on United States population census schedules between 1890 and 1990 to provide insights on the changing meanings of race in US society. The analysis uses a sociology of knowledge perspective which assumes that race is an ideological concept that can be interpreted most productively by relating its definition and measurement to the larger social and political context. Four themes are identified and discussed: (i) the historical and continuing importance of skin colour, usually dichotomized into white and non‐white, in defining race and counting racial groups; (ii) a belief in 'pure' races that is reflected in a preoccupation with categorizing people into a single or 'pure' race; (iii) the role of census categories in creating pan‐ethnic racial groups; and, (iv) the confusing of race and ethnicity in census racial classifications. Each theme demonstrates the potential or actual role of official statistics, exemplified by census racial data, in reflecting and guiding changes to the meaning and social perceptions of race. A detailed examination of racial classifications from the 1980 and 1990 Censuses shows that the influence of political interests on racial statistics is particularly important. The article concludes with a discussion of whether official statistical recorders such as population censuses should categorize and measure race, given the political motivations and non‐scientific character of the classifications used.","10.1080/01419870.1993.9993773","1.0","Sharon M.

"Role of IRS-1-GRB-2 complexes in insulin signaling.","GRB-2 is a small SH2- and SH3 domain-containing adapter protein that associates with the mammalian SOS homolog to regulate p21ras during growth factor signaling. During insulin stimulation, GRB-2 binds to the phosphorylated Y895VNI motif of IRS-1. Substitution of Tyr-895 with phenylalanine (IRS-1F-895) prevented the IRS-1-GRB-2 association in vivo and in vitro. The myeloid progenitor cell line, 32-D, is insensitive to insulin because it contains few insulin receptors and no IRS-1. Coexpression of IRS-1 or IRS-1F-895 with the insulin receptor was required for insulin-stimulated mitogenesis in 32-D cells, while expression of the insulin receptor alone was sufficient to mediate insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and activation of p21ras and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. The Shc-GRB-2 complex formed during insulin stimulation is a possible mediator of p21ras and MAP kinase activation in IRS-1-deficient 32-D cells. Interestingly, IRS-1, but not IRS-1F-895, enhanced the stimulation of MAP kinase by insulin in 32-D cells expressing insulin receptors. Thus, IRS-1 contributes to the stimulation of MAP kinase by insulin, probably through formation of the IRS-1-GRB-2 complex at Tyr-895. Our results suggest that the Shc-GRB-2 complex and the activation of p21ras-dependent signaling pathways, including MAP kinase, are insufficient for insulin-stimulated mitogenesis and that the essential function(s) of IRS-1 in proliferative signaling is largely unrelated to IRS-1-GRB-2 complex formation.","10.1128/mcb.14.6.3577","8.0","Martin G.

"Census from Heaven: An estimate of the global human population using night-time satellite imagery","Night-time satellite imagery provided by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP OLS) is evaluated as a means of estimating the population of all the cities of the world based on their areal extent in the image. A global night-time image product was registered to a dataset of 2000 known city locations with known populations. A relationship between areal extent and city population discovered by Tobler and Nordbeck is identified on a nation by nation basis to estimate the population of the 22 920 urban clusters that exist in the night-time satellite image. The relationship between city population and city areal extent was derived from 1597 city point locations with known population that landed in a 'lit' area of the image. Due to conurbation, these 1597 cities resulted in only 1383 points of analysis for performing regression. When several cities fell into one 'lit' area their populations were summed. The results of this analysis allow for an estimate of the urban population of every nation of the world. By using the known percent of population in urban areas for every nation a total national population was also estimated. The sum of these estimates is a total estimate of the global human population, which in this case was 6.3 billion. This is fairly close to the generally accepted contemporaneous (1997) estimate of the global population which stood at approximately 5.9 billion.","10.1080/01431160010007015","4.0","Paul C.

"The ATLAS3D project - III. A census of the stellar angular momentum within the effective radius of early-type galaxies: unveiling the distribution of fast and slow rotators","We provide a census of the apparent stellar angular momentum within 1 Re of a volume-limited sample of 260 early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the nearby Universe, using integral-field spectroscopy obtained in the course of the ATLAS3D project. We exploit the LambdaR parameter to characterise the existence of two families of ETGs: Slow Rotators which exhibit complex stellar velocity fields and often include stellar kinematically Distinct Cores (KDCs), and Fast Rotators which have regular velocity fields. Our complete sample of 260 ETGs leads to a new criterion to disentangle Fast and Slow Rotators which now includes a dependency on the apparent ellipticity (Epsilon). It separates the two classes significantly better than the previous prescription, and than a criterion based on V/Sigma: Slow Rotators and Fast Rotators have LambdaR lower and larger than kFSxSQRT(Epsilon), respectively, where kFS=0.31 for measurements made within 1 Re. We show that the vast majority of early-type galaxies are Fast Rotators: these have regular stellar rotation, with aligned photometric and kinematic axes (Paper II, Krajnovic et al. 2011}, include discs and often bars and represent 86% (224/260) of all early-type galaxies in the volume-limited ATLAS3D sample. Fast Rotators span the full range of apparent ellipticities from 0 to 0.85, and we suggest that they cover intrinsic ellipticities from about 0.35 to 0.85, the most flattened having morphologies consistent with spiral galaxies. Only a small fraction of ETGs are Slow Rotators representing 14% (36/260) of the ATLAS3D sample of ETGs. Of all Slow Rotators, 11% (4/36) exhibit two counter-rotating stellar disc-like components and are rather low mass objects (Mdyn&lt;10^10.5 M_Sun). All other Slow Rotators (32/36) appear relatively round on the sky (Epsilon_e&lt;0.4), tend to be massive (Mdyn&gt;10^10.5 M_Sun), and often (17/32) exhibit KDCs.","10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.18496.x","24.0","Éric Emsellem; Michele Cappellari; Davor Krajnović; Katherine Alatalo; Leo Blitz; Maxime Bois; F.

"A Census of Precipitation Features in the Tropics Using TRMM: Radar, Ice Scattering, and Lightning Observations","An algorithm has been developed to identify precipitation features (≥75 km2 in size) in two land and two ocean regions during August, September, and October 1998. It uses data from two instruments on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite: near-surface precipitation radar (PR) reflectivities, and TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) 85.5-GHz polarization corrected temperatures (PCTs). These features were classified by size and intensity criteria to identify mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), precipitation with PCTs below 250 K, and other features without PCTs below 250 K. By using this technique, several hypotheses about the convective intensity and rainfall distributions of tropical precipitation systems can be evaluated. It was shown that features over land were much more intense than similar oceanic features as measured by their minimum PCTs, maximum heights of the 30-dBZ contour, and 6-km reflectivities. The diurnal cycle of precipitation features showed a strong afternoon maximum over land and a rather flat distribution over the ocean, quite similar to those found by others using infrared satellite techniques. Precipitation features with MCSs over the ocean contained significantly more rain outside the 250-K PCT isotherm than land systems, and in general, a significant portion (10%–15%) of rainfall in the Tropics falls in systems containing no PCTs less than 250 K. Volumetric rainfall and lightning characteristics (as observed by the Lightning Imaging Sensor aboard TRMM) from the systems were classified by feature intensity; similar rain amounts but highly differing lightning flash rates were found among the regions. Oceanic storms have a bimodal contribution of rainfall from two types of systems: very weak systems with little ice scattering and moderately strong systems that do not produce high lightning flash rates. Continental systems that produce the bulk of the rainfall (as sampled) are likely to have higher lightning flash rates, which are shown to be linked to stronger radar and ice-scattering intensities.","10.1175/1520-0442(2000)013","3.0","Stephen W.

"The Meaning and Measurement of Ethnicity in Malaysia: An Analysis of Census Classifications","In Peninsular Malaysia, the conventional ethnic divisions are “Malay,” “Chinese,” “Indian,” and “Other.” At first glance, this classification seems to represent the popular conception of “race” (the everyday term) as well as the “official” definition. According to the Malaysian constitution, a Malay is a person who was born locally, habitually speaks Malay, follows Malay custom, and professes Islam (Mohammed Suffian bin Hashim 1976:291). The Chinese and Indian communities are supposed to consist of the descendants of immigrants from China and the Indian subcontinent. “Other” is a catchall category for the small number of Eurasians, Thais, Europeans, and other persons who do not fit into the three major categories.","10.2307/2056899","1.0","Charles Hirschman","1987.0","","","meaning; ethnicity; malaysia; census; classifications"
"The Census in the First Century B.C.","The aim of this article is to consider three questions which seem to me to be crucial to the understanding of the late-republican and Augustan censuses: ( a ) Why was only one lustrum —that of 69—performed between 86 and 28 B.C.? ( b ) Does this mean that there was only one census of the Roman people held in that period ? ( c ) Why was the figure of civium capita published in 28 B.C. (4,063,000) so much larger than that for 69 (900,000 or 910,000) ? The third question was re-opened recently when Professor Arnold Toynbee, in a long Annex on the republican census-figures in the first volume of Hannibal's Legacy , endorsed Beloch's view, which Tenney Frank had rejected, that Augustus used radically different criteria for his enumeration from those employed by the censors of the Republic. Moreover, P. A. Brunt has indicated his adherence to Beloch's view in several places, and defends it in detail in his forthcoming book on Italian manpower.","10.2307/299848","1.0","T. P.

"IRS-1 is a common element in insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I signaling to the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase.","IRS-1 is a unique cytosolic protein that becomes tyrosine phosphorylated during insulin stimulation of intact cells and immediately associates with the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PtdIns 3'-kinase). The insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor also mediated the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and increased the amount of PtdIns 3'-kinase activity bound to IRS-1 in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Purified insulin receptor and IGF-I receptor phosphorylated recombinant baculovirus-produced IRS-1 on similar sites in vitro, and phosphorylated baculovirus-produced IRS-1 bound PtdIns 3'-kinase activity from lysates of quiescent cells. Treatment of cells with IGF-I activated the PtdIns 3'-kinase, suggesting that IGF-I activates the PtdIns 3'-kinase through IRS-1 binding to p85 in a manner similar to insulin. Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing IRS-1 demonstrated increased tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and more PtdIns 3'-kinase activity associated with IRS-1 in these cells. These data demonstrate that IRS-1 is a common element for signal transmission by the IGF-I and insulin receptors.","10.1210/endo.132.4.8384986","7.0","Martin G.

"Beyond the Census Tract: Patterns and Determinants of Racial Segregation at Multiple Geographic Scales","The census tract-based residential segregation literature rests on problematic assumptions about geographic scale and proximity. We pursue a new tract-free approach that combines explicitly spatial concepts and methods to examine racial segregation across egocentric local environments of varying size. Using 2000 census data for the 100 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, we compute a spatially modified version of the information theory index H to describe patterns of black-white, Hispanic-white, Asian-white, and multi-group segregation at different scales. The metropolitan structural characteristics that best distinguish micro-segregation from macro-segregation for each group combination are identified, and their effects are decomposed into portions due to racial variation occurring over short and long distances. A comparison of our results to those from tract-based analyses confirms the value of the new approach.","10.1177/000312240807300504","6.0","Barrett A. Lee; Sean F. Reardon; Glenn Firebaugh; Chad R.

"Cooperative Double-IRS Aided Communication: Beamforming Design and Power Scaling","Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising technology to support high performance wireless communication. By adaptively configuring the reflection amplitude and/or phase of each passive reflecting element on it, the IRS can reshape the electromagnetic environment in favour of signal transmission. This letter advances the existing research by proposing and analyzing a double-IRS aided wireless communication system. Under the reasonable assumption that the reflection channel from IRS 1 to IRS 2 is of rank 1 (e.g., line-of-sight channel), we propose a joint passive beamforming design for the two IRSs. Based on this, we show that deploying two cooperative IRSs with in total K elements can yield a power gain of order O(K <sup xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">4</sup> ), which greatly outperforms the case of deploying one traditional IRS with a power gain of order O(K <sup xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">2</sup> ). Our simulation results validate that the performance of deploying two cooperative IRSs is significantly better than that of deploying one IRS given a sufficient total number of IRS elements. We also extend our line-of-sight channel model to show how different channel models affect the performance of the double-IRS aided wireless communication system.","10.1109/lwc.2020.2986290","4.0","Yitao Han; Shuowen Zhang; Lingjie Duan; Rui Zhang","2020.0","","","cooperative; double; irs; aided; communication; beamforming; power; scaling"

Abstract We present high spatial resolution (0.35 and 0.65 arcsec full width at half maximum (FWHM)) near-infrared images of the central 0.2x0.2 pc of the Trapezium Cluster in the Orion Nebula, centered on the Trapezium OB stars. These images provide the most complete census of stars in this region, and we give accurate positions and near-infrared (2.1 microns) magnitudes for 123 stars. After accounting for line-of-sight projection, we estimate a stellar density for the cluster of approximately 4.7 X 104 stars per cubic parsec in the approximately 0.1 pc diameter core. We identify stellar counterparts to virtually all the known dense knots of ionized gas seen at optical and radio wavelengths, strongly supporting the hypothesis that many are either intrinsic stellar radio emitters or circumstellar disks around stars, and not simply dense clumps of gas and dust. We derive approximate masses for the stars associated with the compact knots, finding that the majority are relatively low mass.

"THE COS-HALOS SURVEY: RATIONALE, DESIGN, AND A CENSUS OF CIRCUMGALACTIC NEUTRAL HYDROGEN","We present the design and methods of the COS-Halos survey, a systematic investigation of the gaseous halos of 44 z = 0.15-0.35 galaxies using background QSOs observed with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. This survey has yielded 39 spectra of z_em ~ 0.5 QSOs with S/N ~ 10-15 per resolution element. The QSO sightlines pass within 150 physical kpc of the galaxies, which span early and late types over stellar mass log M* / Msun= 9.5 - 11.5. We find that the CGM exhibits strong HI, averaging 1 Ang in Lya equivalent width out to 150 kpc, with 100% covering fraction for star-forming galaxies and 75% covering for passive galaxies. We find good agreement in column densities between this survey and previous studies over similar range of impact parameter. There is weak evidence for a difference between early- and late-type galaxies in the strength and distribution of HI. Kinematics indicate that the detected material is bound to the host galaxy, such that >~90% of the detected column density is confined within +/-200 km s^-1 of the galaxies. This material generally exists well below the halo virial temperatures at T<~ 10^5 K. We evaluate a number of possible origin scenarios for the detected material, and in the end favor a simple model in which the bulk of the detected HI arises in a bound, cool, low-density photoionized diffuse medium that is generic to all L* galaxies and may harbor a total gaseous mass comparable to galactic stellar masses.","10.1088/0004-637x/777/1/59","14.0","Jason Tumlinson; Christopher Thom; Jessica K.

"A first comprehensive census of fungi in soil reveals both hyperdiversity and fine‐scale niche partitioning","Fungi play key roles in ecosystems as mutualists, pathogens, and decomposers. Current estimates of global species richness are highly uncertain, and the importance of stochastic vs. deterministic forces in the assembly of fungal communities is unknown. Molecular studies have so far failed to reach saturated, comprehensive estimates of fungal diversity. To obtain a more accurate estimate of global fungal diversity, we used a direct molecular approach to census diversity in a boreal ecosystem with precisely known plant diversity, and we carefully evaluated adequacy of sampling and accuracy of species delineation. We achieved the first exhaustive enumeration of fungi in soil, recording 1002 taxa in this system. We show that the fungus : plant ratio in Picea mariana forest soils from interior Alaska is at least 17:1 and is regionally stable. A global extrapolation of this ratio would suggest 6 million species of fungi, as opposed to leading estimates ranging from 616 000 to 1.5 million. We also find that closely related fungi often occupy divergent niches. This pattern is seen in fungi spanning all major functional guilds and four phyla, suggesting a major role of deterministic niche partitioning in community assembly. Extinctions and range shifts are reorganizing biodiversity on Earth, yet our results suggest that 98% of fungi remain undescribed and that many of these species occupy unique niches.","10.1890/12-1693.1","6.0","D.

"Who Counts?: The Politics of Census-Taking in Contemporary America","This article describes some of the legal decisions and problems among politicians and demographers who produce US census counts of population. The impact of the US Supreme Court hearing and decision in Wisconsin vs New York is discussed followed by an analysis of the Census Bureaus plans for the Census in 2000. Census procedures have been challenged since 1988. Litigation forced the use of the Post Enumeration Survey for adjusting the 1990 Census but the Census Director in 1991 issued a recommendation for not adjusting the 1990 counts that was affirmed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in April 1993. Oral arguments were heard in the aforementioned New York case on January 10 1996. New York argued for the implementation of dual system estimation due to undercounting errors that were probably influenced by actions of Republican Commerce officials during the 1980s that prevented improvements in census counting. It was charged that Census Bureau methods violated the intent of Article 1 Section 2 of the Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection. Lawsuits challenged the Bureau to develop methods that would reduce the undercount of minorities and the urban poor. Other arguments of the state of Oklahoma Wisconsin the federal government for the Secretary of Commerce and New York City are summarized. The Solicitor General of the US Drew Days argued that the true total population of the US was unknown and unknowable and that the Secretary of Commerce had the authority to make decisions about the census. The main issue before the court became who had the authority to decide not to adjust. All of the US Supreme Court judges voted on March 20 1996 in favor of unadjusted census counts. The issue of statistical adjustment methods as a violation of the Constitution was not decided. Plans for the census of 2000 include reducing costs and increasing accuracy through a three-stage count strategy.","10.2307/3089013","3.0","Richard Williams; Margo Anderson; Stephen E.

"A Census of the Chamaeleon I Star‐forming Region","I present a new census of the members of the Chamaeleon I star-forming region. Optical spectroscopy has been obtained for 179 objects that have been previously identified as possible members of the cluster, that lack either accurate spectral types or clear evidence of membership, and that are optically visible (I ≲ 18). I have used these spectroscopic data and all other available constraints to evaluate the spectral classifications and membership status of a total sample of 288 candidate members of Chamaeleon I that have appeared in published studies of the cluster. The latest census of Chamaeleon I now contains 158 members, eight of which are later than M6 and thus are likely to be brown dwarfs. I find that many of the objects identified as members of Chamaeleon I in recent surveys are actually field stars. Meanwhile, seven of nine candidates discovered by Carpenter and coworkers are confirmed as members, one of which is the coolest known member of Chamaeleon I at a spectral type of M8 (~0.03 M☉). I have estimated extinctions, luminosities, and effective temperatures for the members and used these data to construct an H-R diagram for the cluster. Chamaeleon I has a median age of ~2 Myr according to evolutionary models and hence is similar in age to IC 348 and is slightly older than Taurus (~1 Myr). The measurement of an initial mass function for Chamaeleon I from this census is not possible because of the disparate methods with which the known members were originally selected and must await an unbiased, magnitude-limited survey of the cluster.","10.1086/381146","1.0","K.

"A MODEL FOR IDENTIFYING GENTRIFIED AREAS WITH CENSUS DATA","Empirical research on gentrification suffers from a dichotomy between richly detailed neighborhood case studies and macro-scale, census-based analyses, perpetuating uncertainty over the extent and timing of gentrified areas in American cities. We develop a model relating tract-level census statistics to the results of a detailed field survey of 24 census tracts in Minneapolis-St. Paul. We use stepwise and canonical discriminant analysis to select nine variables distinguishing gentrified neighborhoods and to classify all central-city tracts for each decade between 1960 and 1990. Results indicate a moderate level of overall accuracy, and the model is more than 90% accurate in distinguishing areas of heavy reinvestment from stable, middle-class districts. Compared with other techniques, our approach more accurately distinguishes gentrification from other types of inner-city redevelopment, providing a useful tool for identifying the phenomenon with a measurable degree of precision.","10.2747/0272-3638.17.3.248","2.0","Daniel J.

"Dasymetric Estimation of Population Density and Areal Interpolation of Census Data","This paper describes techniques to compute and map dasymetric population densities and to areally interpolate census data using dasymetrically derived population weights. These techniques are demonstrated with 1980-2000 census data from the 13-county Atlanta metropolitan area. Land-use/land-cover data derived from remotely sensed satellite imagery were used to determine the areal extent of populated areas, which in turn served as the denominator for dasymetric population density computations at the census tract level. The dasymetric method accounts for the spatial distribution of population within administrative areas, yielding more precise population density estimates than the choroplethic method, while graphically representing the geographic distribution of populations. In order to areally interpolate census data from one set of census tract boundaries to another, the percentages of populated areas affected by boundary changes in each affected tract were used as adjustment weights for census data at the census tract level, where census tract boundary shifts made temporal data comparisons difficult. This method of areal interpolation made it possible to represent three years of census data (1980, 1990, and 2000) in one set of common census tracts (1990). Accuracy assessment of the dasymetrically derived adjustment weights indicated a satisfactory level of accuracy. Dasymetrically derived areal interpolation weights can be applied to any type of geographic boundary re-aggregation, such as from census tracts to zip code tabulation areas, from census tracts to local school districts, from zip code areas to telephone exchange prefix areas, and for electoral redistricting.","10.1559/1523040041649407","3.0","James B.

"A census-based estimate of Earth's bacterial and archaeal diversity","The global diversity of Bacteria and Archaea, the most ancient and most widespread forms of life on Earth, is a subject of intense controversy. This controversy stems largely from the fact that existing estimates are entirely based on theoretical models or extrapolations from small and biased data sets. Here, in an attempt to census the bulk of Earth's bacterial and archaeal (""prokaryotic"") clades and to estimate their overall global richness, we analyzed over 1.7 billion 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequences in the V4 hypervariable region obtained from 492 studies worldwide, covering a multitude of environments and using multiple alternative primers. From this data set, we recovered 739,880 prokaryotic operational taxonomic units (OTUs, 16S-V4 gene clusters at 97% similarity), a commonly used measure of microbial richness. Using several statistical approaches, we estimate that there exist globally about 0.8-1.6 million prokaryotic OTUs, of which we recovered somewhere between 47%-96%, representing >99.98% of prokaryotic cells. Consistent with this conclusion, our data set independently ""recaptured"" 91%-93% of 16S sequences from multiple previous global surveys, including PCR-independent metagenomic surveys. The distribution of relative OTU abundances is consistent with a log-normal model commonly observed in larger organisms; the total number of OTUs predicted by this model is also consistent with our global richness estimates. By combining our estimates with the ratio of full-length versus partial-length (V4) sequence diversity in the SILVA sequence database, we further estimate that there exist about 2.2-4.3 million full-length OTUs worldwide. When restricting our analysis to the Americas, while controlling for the number of studies, we obtain similar richness estimates as for the global data set, suggesting that most OTUs are globally distributed. Qualitatively similar results are also obtained for other 16S similarity thresholds (90%, 95%, and 99%). Our estimates constrain the extent of a poorly quantified rare microbial biosphere and refute recent predictions that there exist trillions of prokaryotic OTUs.","10.1371/journal.pbio.3000106","4.0","Stilianos Louca; Florent Mazel; Michael Doebeli; Laura Wegener Parfrey","2019.0","","","census; estimate; earth; diversity"
"COMPLETING THE CENSUS OF Lyα EMITTERS AT THE REIONIZATION EPOCH $^,$","We carried out extended spectroscopic confirmations of Ly-alpha emitters (LAEs) at z=6.5 and 5.7 in the Subaru Deep Field. Now, the total number of spectroscopically confirmed LAEs is 45 and 54 at z=6.5 and 5.7, respectively, and at least 81% (70%) of our photometric candidates at z=6.5 (5.7) have been spectroscopically identified as real LAEs. We made careful measurements of the Ly-alpha luminosity, both photometrically and spectroscopically, to accurately determine the Ly-alpha and rest-UV luminosity functions (LFs). The substantially improved evaluation of the Ly-alpha LF at z=6.5 shows an apparent deficit from z=5.7 at least at the bright end, and a possible decline even at the faint end, though small uncertainties remain. The rest-UV LFs at z=6.5 and 5.7 are in good agreement, at least at the bright end, in clear contrast to the differences seen in the Ly-alpha LF. These results imply an increase in the neutral fraction of the intergalactic medium from z=5.7 to 6.5. The rest-frame equivalent width (EW_0) distribution at z=6.5 seems to be systematically smaller than z=5.7, and it shows an extended tail toward larger EW_0. The bright end of the rest-UV LF can be reproduced from the observed Ly-alpha LF and a reasonable EW_0-UV luminosity relation. Integrating this rest-UV LF provides the first measurement of the contribution of LAEs to the photon budget required for reionization. The derived UV LF suggests that the fractional contribution of LAEs to the photon budget among Lyman break galaxies significantly increases towards faint magnitudes. Low-luminosity LAEs could dominate the ionizing photon budget, though this inference depends strongly on the uncertain faint-end slope of the Ly-alpha LF.","10.1088/0004-637x/734/2/119","19.0","Nobunari Kashikawa; Kazuhiro Shimasaku; Yuichi Matsuda; Eiichi Egami; Linhua Jiang; Tohru Nagao; Masami Ouchi; Matthew A.

"First global census of the Adélie Penguin","We report on the first global census of the Adélie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae), achieved using a combination of ground counts and satellite imagery, and find a breeding population 53% larger (3.79 million breeding pairs) than the last estimate in 1993. We provide the first abundance estimates for 41 previously unsurveyed colonies, which collectively contain 420,000 breeding pairs, and report on 17 previously unknown colonies, 11 of which may be recent colonizations. These recent colonizations represent ∼5% of the increase in known breeding population and provide insight into the ability of these highly philopatric seabirds to colonize new breeding territories. Additionally, we report on 13 colonies not found in the survey, including 8 that we conclude have gone extinct. We find that Adélie Penguin declines on the Antarctic Peninsula are more than offset by increases in East Antarctica. Our global population assessment provides a robust baseline for understanding future changes in abundance and distribution. These results are a critically needed contribution to ongoing negotiations regarding the design and implementation of Marine Protected Areas for the Southern Ocean.","10.1642/auk-14-31.1","2.0","Heather J.

"A census of eddy activities in the South China Sea during 1993–2007","Numerous mesoscale eddies occur each year in the South China Sea (SCS), but their statistical characteristics are still not well documented. A Pacific basin‐wide three‐dimensional physical‐biogeochemical model has been developed and the result in the SCS subdomain is used to quantify the eddy activities during the period of 1993–2007. The modeled results are compared with a merged and gridded satellite product of sea level anomaly by using the same eddy identification and tracking method. On average, there are about 32.9 ± 2.4 eddies predicted by the model and 32.8 ± 3.4 eddies observed by satellite each year, and about 52% of them are cyclonic eddies. The radius of these eddies ranges from about 46.5 to 223.5 km, with a mean value of 87.4 km. More than 70% of the eddies have a radius smaller than 100 km. The mean area covered by these eddies each year is around 160,170 km 2 , equivalent to 9.8% of the SCS area with water depths greater than 1000 m. Linear relationships are found between eddy lifetime and eddy magnitude and between eddy vertical extent and eddy magnitude, showing that strong eddies usually last longer and penetrate deeper than weak ones. Interannual variations in eddy numbers and the total eddy‐occupied area indicate that eddy activities in the SCS do not directly correspond to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation events. The wind stress curls are thought to be an important but not the only mechanism of eddy genesis in the SCS.","10.1029/2009jc005657","5.0","Peng Xiu; Fei Chai; Lei Shi; Huijie Xue; Yi Chao","2010.0","","","census; activities; south; china; sea"

"Cytokine responses of human lung cells (BEAS-2B) treated with micron-sized and nanoparticles of metal oxides compared to soil dusts","The induction of cytokines by airway cells in vitro has been widely used to assess the effects of ambient and occupational particles. This study measured cytotoxicity and the release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 by human bronchial epithelial cells treated with manufactured nano- and micron-sized particles of Al2O3, CeO2, Fe2O3, NiO, SiO2, and TiO2, with soil-derived particles from fugitive dust sources, and with the positive controls LPS, TNF-α, and VOSO4. The nano-sized particles were not consistently more potent than an equal mass of micron-sized particles of the same nominal composition for the induction of IL-6 and IL-8 secretion in the in vitro models used in this study. The manufactured pure oxides were much less potent than natural PM2.5 particles derived from soil dust, and the cells were highly responsive to the positive controls. The nano-sized particles in the media caused artifacts in the measurement of IL-6 by ELISA due to adsorption of the cytokine on the high-surface-area particles. The potency for inducing IL-6 secretion by BEAS-2B cells did not correlate with the generation of reactive oxygen species in cell-free media. Direct comparisons of manufactured metal oxide nanoparticles and previously studied types of particles and surrogate proinflammatory agonists showed that the metal oxide particles have low potency to induce IL-6 secretion in BEAS-2B cells. Particle artifacts from non-biological effects need to be considered in experiments of this type, and the limitations inherent in cell culture studies must be considered when interpreting in vitro results. This study suggests that manufactured metal oxide nanoparticles are not highly toxic to lung cells compared to environmental particles.","10.1186/1743-8977-4-2","5.0","John M. Veranth; Erin G.

"Spatially disaggregated population estimates in the absence of national population and housing census data","Population numbers at local levels are fundamental data for many applications, including the delivery and planning of services, election preparation, and response to disasters. In resource-poor settings, recent and reliable demographic data at subnational scales can often be lacking. National population and housing census data can be outdated, inaccurate, or missing key groups or areas, while registry data are generally lacking or incomplete. Moreover, at local scales accurate boundary data are often limited, and high rates of migration and urban growth make existing data quickly outdated. Here we review past and ongoing work aimed at producing spatially disaggregated local-scale population estimates, and discuss how new technologies are now enabling robust and cost-effective solutions. Recent advances in the availability of detailed satellite imagery, geopositioning tools for field surveys, statistical methods, and computational power are enabling the development and application of approaches that can estimate population distributions at fine spatial scales across entire countries in the absence of census data. We outline the potential of such approaches as well as their limitations, emphasizing the political and operational hurdles for acceptance and sustainable implementation of new approaches, and the continued importance of traditional sources of national statistical data.","10.1073/pnas.1715305115","10.0","Nicola Wardrop; Warren C.

"Fatal Outcomes from Liposuction: Census Survey of Cosmetic Surgeons","Troubling reports of adverse outcomes after liposuction prompted a census survey of aesthetic plastic surgeons. All 1200 actively practicing North American boardcertified ASAPS members were polled by facsimile, then mail, regarding deaths after liposuction. Patient initials together with case summaries precluded data replication yet assured patient anonymity and preserved surgeon privacy. Incomplete returns or ambiguous findings were authenticated, where feasible, by direct follow-up. Total number of lipoplasties performed by plastic surgeons was interpolated from the ASPRS procedure database for the survey time frame of 1994 to mid-1998. Lacking reliable annual case volume estimates, deaths from lipoplasties performed by non-ABPS surgeons were excluded from the actual mortality rate computation but were included in cause-of-death ranking statistics. Responding aesthetic plastic surgeons (917 of 1200) reported 95 uniquely authenticated fatalities in 496,245 lipoplasties. In this census survey, the mortality rate computed to 1 in 5224, or 19.1 per 100,000. A virtually identical 20.3 per 100,000 mortality rate was obtained in a 1997 random survey commissioned by the parent society. Pulmonary thromboembolism remains as the major killer (23.4 ± 2.6 percent); lacking consistent medical examiners' toxicology data, the putative role of high-dose lidocaine cardiotoxicity could not be ascertained. Where so stated, many deaths occurred during the first night after discharge home; prudence suggests vigilant observation for residual ""hangover"" from sedative/anesthetic drugs after lengthy procedures. Taken together, these two independent surveys peg the late 1990s mortality rate from liposuction at about 20 per 100,000, or 1 in every 5000 procedures. Set beside the 16.4 per 100,000 fatality rates of U.S. motor vehicle accidents, liposuction is not an altogether benign procedure.

"The Political Economy of the IRS","This paper tests a multiple principal–agent model of the Internal Revenue Service. Using data for 33 IRS districts over six tax years, 1992–1997, we report evidence that the fraction of individual income tax returns audited is significantly lower in districts that are important to the president electorally and that have representation on key congressional committees. These findings suggest that the IRS is not a rogue government agency, but rather is an effective bureaucratic agent of its political sponsors. “Reforming” the IRS by subjecting it to an independent oversight board appointed by the president would therefore seem to be redundant.","10.1111/1468-0343.00090","3.0","Marilyn B.

"When UAV Meets IRS: Expanding Air-Ground Networks via Passive Reflection","Thanks to their flexibility and mobility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely applied in wireless networks. However, UAV communications may suffer from blockage and eavesdropping in practical scenarios due to the complex environment. Taking the recent advances in intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to reconfigure the propagation environments, in this article, we employ IRS to enhance the performance of UAV-aided air-ground networks. First, we overview the combination of UAV and IRS, by introducing the diverse applications of IRS and the appealing advantages of UAV, and highlighting the benefits of combining them. Then, we investigate two case studies where the UAV trajectory, the transmit beamforming and the IRS passive beamforming are jointly optimized. In the first case study, by equipping the IRS on a UAV, the average achievable rate of the relaying network is maximized. In the second one, the IRS is deployed to assist the UAV-ground communication while combating the adversarial eavesdropper. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance enhancement resulting from combining UAV and IRS in air-ground networks. Finally, we shed light on some challenging issues to be resolved for practical implementations in this direction.","10.1109/mwc.010.2000528","6.0","Xiaowei Pang; Min Sheng; Nan Zhao; Jie Tang; Dusit Niyato; Kai‐Kit Wong","2021.0","","","uav; meets; irs; expanding; air; ground; networks; passive; reflection"

"IRS-Assisted Secure UAV Transmission via Joint Trajectory and Beamforming Design","Despite the wide utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), UAV communications are susceptible to eavesdropping due to air-ground line-of-sight channels. Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is capable of reconfiguring the propagation environment, and thus is an attractive solution for integrating with UAV to facilitate the security in wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate the secure transmission design for an IRS-assisted UAV network in the presence of an eavesdropper. With the aim at maximizing the average secrecy rate, the trajectory of UAV, the transmit beamforming, and the phase shift of IRS are jointly optimized. To address this sophisticated problem, we decompose it into three sub-problems and resort to an iterative algorithm to solve them alternately. First, we derive the closed-form solution to the active beamforming. Then, with the optimal transmit beamforming, the passive beamforming optimization problem of fractional programming is transformed into corresponding parametric sub-problems. Moreover, the successive convex approximation is applied to deal with the non-convex UAV trajectory optimization problem by reformulating a convex problem which serves as a lower bound for the original one. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and the performance improvement achieved by the joint trajectory and beamforming design.","10.1109/tcomm.2021.3136563","6.0","Xiaowei Pang; Nan Zhao; Jie Tang; Celimuge Wu; Dusit Niyato; Kai‐Kit Wong","2021.0","USC","","irs; assisted; secure; uav; transmission; joint; trajectory; beamforming"

"A global census of nitrogenase diversity","Summary The global diversity of nitrogen‐fixing microorganisms was assessed through construction and analysis of an aligned database of 16 989 nifH sequences. We conclude that the diversity of diazotrophs is still poorly described and that many organisms remain to be discovered. Our analyses indicate that diversity is not distributed evenly across phylogenetic groups or across environments and that some of the most diverse assemblages and environments remain the most poorly characterized. The majority of OTUs were rare, falling in the long tail of the frequency distribution. The most dominant OTUs fell into either the Cyanobacteria or the α , β , and γ Proteobacteria , and five of these dominant OTUs do not have any representatives cultivated in isolation. Soils contained the greatest diversity of nifH sequences of all of the environments surveyed. Cluster III, which is dominated by nifH sequences from obligate anaerobes, was found to contain the greatest diversity of all nifH lineages and is also the group for which diversity is the least sampled. Our findings provide context for ongoing efforts to explore diazotroph diversity, indicating specific groups and environments that remain poorly characterized.","10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02488.x","2.0","John Christian Gaby; Daniel H.

"Spectral and Energy Efficiency of IRS-Assisted MISO Communication With Hardware Impairments","In this letter, we analyze the spectral and energy efficiency of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink system with hardware impairments. An extended error vector magnitude (EEVM) model is utilized to characterize the impact of radio-frequency (RF) impairments at the access point (AP) and phase noise is considered at the IRS. We show that the spectral efficiency is limited due to the hardware impairments even when the numbers of AP antennas and IRS elements grow infinitely large, which is in contrast with the conventional case with ideal hardware. Moreover, the performance degradation at high SNR is shown to be mainly affected by the AP hardware impairments rather than by the phase noise at the IRS. We further obtain in closed form the optimal transmit power for energy efficiency maximization.

"Evidence That IRS-2 Phosphorylation Is Required for Insulin Action in Hepatocytes","Insulin receptor substrates (IRSs) are tyrosine-phosphorylated following stimulation with insulin, insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), and interleukins. A key question is whether different IRSs play different roles to mediate insulin's metabolic and growth-promoting effects. In a novel system of insulin receptor-deficient hepatocytes, insulin fails to (i) stimulate glucose phosphorylation, (ii) enhance glycogen synthesis, (iii) suppress glucose production, and (iv) promote mitogenesis. However, insulin's ability to induce IRS-1 and gab-1 phosphorylation and binding to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase is unaffected, by virtue of the compensatory actions of IGF-1 receptors. In contrast, phosphorylation of IRS-2 and generation of IRS-2/PI 3-kinase complexes are markedly reduced. Thus, absence of insulin receptors selectively reduces IRS-2, but not IRS-1 phosphorylation, and the impairment of IRS-2 activation is associated with lack of insulin effects. To address whether phosphorylation of additional IRSs is also affected, we analyzed phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in PI 3-kinase immunoprecipitates from insulin-treated cells. However, these experiments indicate that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are the main PI 3-kinase-bound proteins in hepatocytes.

"On the Validity of Using Census Geocode Characteristics to Proxy Individual Socioeconomic Characteristics","Abstract Investigators of social differentials in health outcomes commonly augment incomplete microdata by appending socioeconomic characteristics of residential areas (such as median income in a zip code) to proxy for individual characteristics. But little empirical attention has been paid to how well this aggregate information serves as a proxy for the individual characteristics of interest. We build on recent work addressing the biases inherent in proxies and consider two health-related examples within a statistical framework that illuminates the nature and sources of biases. Data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey are linked to census data. We assess the validity of using the aggregate census information as a proxy for individual information when estimating main effects and when controlling for potential confounding between socioeconomic and sociodemographic factors in measures of general health status and infant mortality. We find a general, but not universal, tendency for aggregate proxies to exaggerate the effects of micro-level variables and to do more poorly than micro-level variables at controlling for confounding. The magnitude and direction of these biases vary across samples, however. Our statistical framework and empirical findings suggest the difficulties in and limits to interpreting proxies derived from aggregate census data as if they were micro-level variables. The statistical framework that we outline for our study of health outcomes should be generally applicable to other situations where researchers have merged aggregate data with microdata samples.","10.1080/01621459.1996.10476918","3.0","Arline T.

"Toxicity of Graphene in Normal Human Lung Cells (BEAS-2B)","Graphite nanomaterials such as thermally exfoliated graphite oxide (GO) are versatile in many applications. However, little is known about its effects on biological systems. In this study we characrerized the GO using dynamic light scattering (DLS) along with the toxicological aspects related to cytotoxicity and apoptosis in normal human lung cells (BEAS-2B). A significant concentration and time dependent decrease in cell viability was observed at different concentrations (10-100 microg/ml) by the MTT assay after 24 and 48 h of exposure and significant increase of early and late apoptotic cells was observed as compared to control cells. Our study demonstrates that GO induces cytotoxicity and apoptosis in human lung cells.","10.1166/jbn.2011.1224","7.0","N.V. Srikanth Vallabani; Sandeep Mittal; Ritesh K. Shukla; Alok K.

"Source‐Sink Population Dynamics may Complicate the Interpretation of Long‐ Term Census Data","We examined the reproductive success and long—term population dynamics of Neotropical migrant birds in the fragmented landscapes of Illinois. Our primary objective was to assess whether annual variation in abundances and persistence of populations within woodlots was related to variation in reproductive success. Nesting success of migrants was so low in the woodlots where we sampled that it is unlikely that these populations are self—sustaining. Moreover, populations frequently disappear from and recolonize these woodlots. These data suggest that the source—sink metaphor for population dynamics within spatially structured populations is applicable to migratory birds in Illinois. The scale of this dynamic is unknown, but may be regional (i.e., midwestern U.S.). An important implication of this result is that census data must be interpreted carefully. For one woodlot, we detected no systematic trend in the overall abundances of migratory birds over much of the 20th century. Yet the viability of populations within that woodlot likely decreased dramatically over that time owing to increasing rates of nest predation and brood parasitism. Lack of data on dispersal is a major gap in understanding the population dynamics of Neotropical migrants and prescribing effective conservation measures.","10.2307/2265649","2.0","Jeffrey D.

"Bird Census Techniques, Second Edition","Numerous text figures and tables.ISBN 0-12-095831-7.$55.00 (cloth).Conservation concerns, federal mandates to monitor birds, and citizen science programs have spawned a variety of surveys that collect information on bird populations.Unfortunately, all too frequently these surveys are poorly designed and use inappropriate counting methods.Some of the flawed approaches reflect a lack of understanding of statistical design; many ornithologists simply are not aware that many of our most entrenched counting methods (such as point counts) cannot appropriately be used in studies that compare densities of birds over space and time.It is likely that most of the readers of The Condor have participated in a bird population survey that has been criticized for poor sampling methods.For example, North American readers may be surprised to read in Bird Census Techniques that the North American Breeding Bird Survey ''is seriously flawed in its design,'' and that ''Analysis of trends is impossible from points that are positioned along roads'' (p.109).Our conservation efforts are at risk if we do not acknowledge these concerns and improve our survey designs.Other surveys suffer from a lack of focus.In Bird Census Techniques, the authors emphasize that all surveys require clear statements of objectives and an understanding of appropriate survey designs to meet their objectives.Too often, we view survey design as the realm of ornithologists who know the life histories and logistical issues relevant to counting birds.This view reflects pure hubris: survey design is a collaboration between ornithologists, statisticians, and managers, in which goals based on management needs are met by applying statistical principles for design to the biological context of the species of interest.Poor survey design is often due to exclusion of some of these partners from survey development.Because ornithologists are too frequently unaware of these issues, books such as Bird Census Techniques take on added importance as manuals for educating ornithologists about the relevance of survey design and methods and the often subtle interdisciplinary nature of surveys.Bird Census Techniques begins with the bold claim that its first edition ''has been pivotal in raising the profile and standard of bird surveying worldwide,'' and casts this edition as an update that retains the goals of ''amalgamating text on the various bird counting methodologies'' and acting as a ''handbook for ornithological research'' (p.xvii).To meet these goals, the book covers a large amount of mate-","10.1650/0010-5422(2002)104","1.0","John R.

"PTEN inhibits insulin-stimulated MEK/MAPK activation and cell growth by blocking IRS-1 phosphorylation and IRS-1/Grb-2/Sos complex formation in a breast cancer model","The tumour suppressor gene PTEN encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase that recognizes protein substrates and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate. PTEN seems to play multiple roles in tumour suppression and the blockade of phosphoinositide-3-kinase signalling is important for its growth suppressive effects, although precise mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we show that PTEN plays a unique role in the insulin-signalling pathway in a breast cancer model. Ectopic expression of wild-type PTEN in MCF-7 epithelial breast cancer cells resulted in universal inhibition of Akt phosphorylation in response to stimulation by diverse growth factors and selective inhibition of MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation stimulated by insulin or insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). The latter was accompanied by a decrease in the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and the association of IRS-1 with Grb2/Sos, without affecting the phosphorylation status of the insulin receptor and Shc, nor Shc/Grb2 complex formation. The MEK inhibitor, PD980059, but not the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, abolished the effect of PTEN on insulin-stimulated cell growth. Without addition of insulin, wortmannin reduced PTEN-mediated growth suppression, whereas PD980059 had little effect, suggesting that PTEN suppresses insulin-stimulated cell growth by blocking the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Furthermore, PD980059 treatment led to the downregulation of cyclin D1 and the suppression of cell cycle progression. Our data suggest that PTEN blocks MAPK phosphorylation in response to insulin stimulation by inhibiting the phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-1/Grb2/Sos complex formation, which leads to downregulation of cyclin D1, inhibition of cell cycle progression and suppression of cell growth.","10.1093/hmg/10.6.605","1.0","Charis Eng","2001.0","","","pten; insulin; mek; mapk; activation; cell; growth; irs; phosphorylation; grb; sos; formation; breast; cancer"

"Nck associates with the SH2 domain-docking protein IRS-1 in insulin-stimulated cells.","Nck, an oncogenic protein composed of one SH2 and three SH3 domains, is a common target for various cell surface receptors. Nck is thought to function as an adaptor protein to couple cell surface receptors to downstream effector molecules that regulate cellular responses induced by receptor activation. In this report, we show that Nck forms a stable complex in vivo with IRS-1 in insulin-stimulated cells. The interaction between IRS-1 and Nck is mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of Nck to tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1. Although Nck associates with IRS-1, Nck phosphorylation is not affected by insulin stimulation. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies show that the SH2 domains of Nck, GRB2, and p85 bind distinct phosphotyrosine residues in IRS-1. After insulin stimulation all three signaling molecules can be found complexed to a single IRS-1 molecule. These findings provide further evidence that, in response to insulin stimulation, IRS-1 acts as an SH2 docking protein that coordinates the regulation of various different signaling pathways activated by the insulin receptor.","10.1073/pnas.90.24.11713","9.0","Chi‐Hon Lee; W Li; Riko Nishimura; Jinrong Min; Andreas Batzer; Martin G.

"On the reliability of enumeration for mark and recapture census of voles","Some studies of populations in small rodents rely on enumeration of individuals to provide an estimate of population size. A computer simulation of the capture–recapture process was used to examine the influence of five population parameters on the reliability of enumeration. Enumeration is shown to be insensitive to population size, survival between sampling intervals, and individual variation in the probability of capture. Enumeration is sensitive to the probability of capture; if the probability of capture for the average individual falls below 0.5, the enumeration technique provides a poor estimate of population size. Enumeration is also extremely sensitive to reduced probabilities of capture for unmarked animals. Data from capture–recapture studies of five species of Microtus were used in the computer simulation, and it was concluded for these five species that enumerated populations are at least 10–20% smaller than the actual populations.","10.1139/z76-114","3.0","Ray Hilborn; J.

"Zip Code Caveat: Bias Due to Spatiotemporal Mismatches Between Zip Codes and US Census–Defined Geographic Areas—The Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project","Use of zip codes in US public health research is on the rise. As of February 2002, 230 articles were indexed by zip code in PubMed,1 all published since 1989. Fifty-two of these articles (23%) involved the use of censusderived zip code socioeconomic data (e.g., median household income) to investigate the effects of socioeconomic position on specified health outcomes (article citations are available on request from the authors). To date, discussions regarding the use of zip code socioeconomic data for US public health research have focused chiefly on whether zip codes' larger population size (average: 30 000) and potentially greater socioeconomic heterogeneity would attenuate estimates of socioeconomic gradients in health detected using zip codes in comparison with estimates obtained via census tract (average population: 4000) or block group (average population: 1000) socioeconomic data.2–7 Unacknowledged in the public health literature, however, is the fact that zip codes differ from census tracts and block groups in other important ways, including spatiotemporal definition and stability. Unlike census tracts, defined by the US Bureau of the Census as “small, relatively permanent statistical subdivision[s] of a county . . . designed to be relatively homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions,”8(ppG-10–G-11) zip codes are “administrative units established by the United States Postal Service . . . for the most efficient delivery of mail, and therefore generally do not respect political or census statistical area boundaries.”9(pA-13) Spanning in size from a single building or company with a high volume of mail to large areas that cut across states, “carrier routes for one zip code may intertwine with those of one or more zip codes” such that “this area is more conceptual than geographic.”10 To “overcome the difficulties in precisely defining the land area covered by each zip code,”11 the US Census Bureau created a new statistical entity built from census blocks: the 5-digit zip code tabulation area (ZCTA), first used in the 2000 census.12 Of note, ZCTAs and zip codes sharing the same 5-digit code may not necessarily cover the same area (Table 1 ▶),13 so that zip codes obtained via self-report or from addresses in medical records cannot be assumed to correspond to census-defined ZCTAs. TABLE 1 —Technical Definitions of and Distinctions Between Zip Codes and Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) Even before introduction of the ZCTAs, there were 2 types of spatiotemporal discontinuity that could conceivably affect health studies linking zip codes to census-derived data: (1) changes in zip code delivery routes—and hence in population covered by the affected zip code—and (2) discontinuation and addition of zip codes in nondecennial years.14–16 Between 1997 and 2001 alone, the US Post Office added approximately 390 new zip codes nationwide and discontinued 120 (oral communication, Meg Ausman, US Post Office Data Center, February 5, 2002). One implication of these changes is that persons could be correctly geocoded to a zip code that did not exist in the preceding decennial census. Findings from the Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project17 illustrate the potential problems for health research of spatiotemporal zip code–census mismatches, even those dating from before the creation of ZCTAs. This project was designed to assess which area-based socioeconomic measures at which levels of geography (census tract, block group, and zip code) are most appropriate for monitoring socioeconomic inequalities in health. Health data from 2 states (Massachusetts and Rhode Island) and the 1990 census were used. Records were geocoded in 1999 by a firm whose accuracy we ascertained to be high (96%),18 and the firm, following standard practice, returned the most recent geocodes available. Cancer incidence rates were one of the health outcomes addressed. We found that in Massachusetts (474 zip codes listed in the 1990 census), 17 376 (10.4%) of the 166 730 cancer cases occurring during 1987 to 1993 were geocoded to 193 zip codes not included in the 1990 census; 15 774 (90.8%) of these 17 376 cases were in one of 30 zip codes changed or established after the 1990 census.19–21 By contrast, in Rhode Island (70 zip codes listed in the 1990 census), only 0.7% (148) of the 19 766 geocoded cancer incidence records were matched to zip codes not included in the 1990 census. In the case of colon cancer incidence in Massachusetts, moreover, the impact of excluding persons linked to zip codes not included in the 1990 census was substantial. Zip code–level analyses yielded socioeconomic gradients contrary to those observed via data at the tract and block group levels and contrary to those reported in the literature (Tables 2–4 ▶ ▶ ▶).22 TABLE 2 —Incident Colon Cancer Counts by Geographic Level: Massachusetts, 1987–1993 TABLE 3 —Colon Cancer Incidence Rates, Stratified by Area-Based Socioeconomic Measures, Among Persons in Areas With the Least and Most Resources, Along With Age-Adjusted Comparisons (Incidence Rate Ratio and Relative Index of Inequality): Massachusetts, ... TABLE 4 —Area-Based Socioeconomic Measures and Cutpoints Used in Data Analysis Given the growing interest in linking geographic and health data,23,24 we urge researchers, when using geocoded records, to pay careful attention to the potential for spatiotemporal mismatches between censusderived and zip code data as well as to changes in zip code boundaries and years in which boundaries were established. Public health projects and programs that use zip code data should likewise be alert to potential new issues stemming from the replacement of zip codes with ZCTAs in the 2000 census.","10.2105/ajph.92.7.1100","6.0","Nancy Krieger; Pamela D.

"Glucokinase and IRS-2 are required for compensatory cell hyperplasia in response to high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance","Glucokinase (Gck) functions as a glucose sensor for insulin secretion, and in mice fed standard chow, haploinsufficiency of β cell–specific Gck (Gck+/–) causes impaired insulin secretion to glucose, although the animals have a normal β cell mass. When fed a high-fat (HF) diet, wild-type mice showed marked β cell hyperplasia, whereas Gck+/– mice demonstrated decreased β cell replication and insufficient β cell hyperplasia despite showing a similar degree of insulin resistance. DNA chip analysis revealed decreased insulin receptor substrate 2 (Irs2) expression in HF diet–fed Gck+/– mouse islets compared with wild-type islets. Western blot analyses confirmed upregulated Irs2 expression in the islets of HF diet–fed wild-type mice compared with those fed standard chow and reduced expression in HF diet–fed Gck+/– mice compared with those of HF diet–fed wild-type mice. HF diet–fed Irs2+/– mice failed to show a sufficient increase in β cell mass, and overexpression of Irs2 in β cells of HF diet–fed Gck+/– mice partially prevented diabetes by increasing β cell mass. These results suggest that Gck and Irs2 are critical requirements for β cell hyperplasia to occur in response to HF diet–induced insulin resistance.","10.1172/jci17645","20.0","Yasuo Terauchi; I.

"Fast Beam Training for IRS-Assisted Multiuser Communications","In this letter, we consider an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted multiuser communication system, where an IRS is deployed to provide virtual line-of-sight (LoS) links between an access point (AP) and multiple users. We consider the practical codebook-based IRS passive beamforming and study efficient design for IRS reflect beam training, which is challenging due to the large number of IRS reflecting elements. In contrast to the conventional single-beam training, we propose a new multi-beam training method by dividing the IRS reflecting elements into multiple sub-arrays and designing their simultaneous multi-beam steering over time. By simply comparing the received signal power over time, each user can detect its optimal IRS beam direction with a high probability, even without searching over all possible beam directions as the single-beam training. Simulation results show that our proposed multi-beam training significantly reduces the training time of conventional single-beam training and yet achieves comparable IRS passive beamforming performance for data transmission.","10.1109/lwc.2020.3005980","3.0","Changsheng You; Beixiong Zheng; Rui Zhang","2020.0","","","fast; beam; training; irs; assisted; multiuser; communications"
"Identification of Iron Species in Fe−BEA: Influence of the Exchange Level","A series of Fe−zeolite-beta (Fe−BEA and 57Fe−BEA) has been prepared either by exchanging BEA (Si/Al = 12.5) with Fe(NO3)3 or by impregnation. The identification of Fe species in Fe−BEA has been carried out by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) with H2 or CO and Mössbauer and DRIFT spectroscopies after various pretreatments. These pretreatments consisted of the calcination by O2, the reduction by H2, and the calcination by N2O of the prereduced sample. After calcination in O2, Fe2O3 aggregates are only present when the exchange level exceeded 100%. At an exchange level lower than 100%, Fe would mainly be present as binuclear oxocations of the type [(OH)FeOFe(OH)]2+, with the proportion decreasing as Fe content decreases. There are some unreducible Fe atoms, possibly in tetrahedral coordination in the zeolite framework. After the calcination in N2O of prereduced Fe−BEA, the great difference stands in the formation of different Fe oxocations, much more easily reducible than those formed upon calcination in O2. It is postulated that these specific oxocations would mainly be composed of mononuclear Fe species.","10.1021/jp0021906","6.0","Mathias Mauvezin; Gérard Delahay; Bernard Coq; Stéphane Kieger; J.C.

"IRS proteins and diabetic complications","IRS proteins are cellular adaptor molecules that mediate many of the key metabolic actions of insulin. When tyrosine is phosphorylated by the activated insulin receptor, IRS proteins recruit downstream effectors, such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase, in order to elicit cellular responses such as glucose uptake, lipid metabolism and cell proliferation. There are two main IRS proteins in humans (IRS1 and IRS2), both of which are widely expressed. Given their central role in the insulin signalling pathway, it is not surprising that male mice lacking Irs1 or Irs2 present with elevated blood glucose or type 2 diabetes, respectively. For reasons yet to be identified, female Irs2 −/− mice do not develop type 2 diabetes. A number of organs are affected by complications of diabetes; macrovascular complications include stroke and coronary artery disease, while nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy fall into the category of microvascular complications. Given the serious consequences of these complications on patient morbidity and mortality, it is essential to identify the molecular pathogenesis underlying diabetic complications, with a view to improving therapeutic intervention and patient outcomes. A number of recently published papers have converged on the hypothesis that the loss of insulin signalling and IRS proteins is instrumental to the development and/or progression of diabetic complications. This review will summarise some highlights from the published work in which this hypothesis is discussed.","10.1007/s00125-016-4072-7","3.0","Deborah Lavin; Morris F. White; Derek P.

U.S. adults in 2020 were four times more likely to screen positive for depressive and anxiety disorders than in 2019, with the largest increases among males, 18- to 29-year-olds (for depression), Asian Americans, and parents with children in the home. Anxiety and depression rose and fell in tandem with the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S., as well as increasing during the early June weeks of racial justice protests.

The Census Bureau has dealt with this problem, which has been increasing in severity over time, by imputing incomes of non-respondents. Their imputation procedure, called the ""hot deck,"" essentially matches nonrespondents with demographically similar donors. In this paper we evaluate the census imputation methodology and raise some questions. First, the census procedure is tied to commonality of events in the population rather than the more appropriate informational content of regressors. Clearly, the census procedure severely understates income in certain occupations. Because it is based on the apparently invalid assumption that income does not affect reporting propensities, it most likely understates average incomes as well.","10.1086/261386","3.0","Lee A.

"Species Turnover Rates on Islands: Dependence on Census Interval","Measurements of species turnover in island bird communities demonstrate two trends with increasing census interval t: (i) Apparent turnover rates T decrease greatly with t, and (ii) the coefficient of variation of T decreases asymptotically to a constant value. These effects are predicted by a statistical model whose parameters are the immigration and extinction probabilities of each species. Available bird censuses at intervals of decades underestimate turnover rates by about an order of magnitude.","10.1126/science.197.4300.266","2.0","Jared M. Diamond; Robert M.

"Relationship of Effective to Census Size in Fluctuating Populations","Abstract: The effective size of a population ( N e ) rather than the census size ( N ) determines its rate of genetic drift. Knowing the ratio of effective to census size, N e / N , is useful for estimating the effective size of a population from census data and for examining how different ecological factors influence effective size. Two different multigenerational ratios have been used in the literature based on either the arithmetic mean or the harmonic mean in the denominator. We clarify the interpretation and meaning of these ratios. The arithmetic mean N e / N ratio compares the total number of real individuals to the long‐term effective size of the population. The harmonic mean N e / N ratio summarizes variation in the N e / N ratio for each generation. In addition, we show that the ratio of the harmonic mean population size to the arithmetic mean population size provides a useful measure of how much fluctuation in size reduced the effective size of a population. We discuss applications of these ratios and emphasize how to use the harmonic mean N e / N ratio to estimate the effective size of a population over a period of time for which census counts have been collected.","10.1046/j.1523-1739.2002.00134.x","2.0","Steven T.

"Joint Power Control and Passive Beamforming in IRS-Assisted Spectrum Sharing","In cognitive radio (CR) communication systems, it is challenging to achieve high rate for the secondary user (SU) in the presence of strong cross-link interference with the primary user (PU). In this letter, we exploit the recently proposed intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to tackle this problem. Specifically, we investigate an IRS-assisted CR system where an IRS is deployed to assist in the spectrum sharing between a PU link and an SU link. We aim to maximize the achievable SU rate subject to a given signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) target for the PU link, by jointly optimizing the SU transmit power and IRS reflect beamforming. Although the formulated problem is difficult to solve due to its non-convexity and coupled variables, we propose an efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization and successive convex approximation techniques to solve it sub-optimally, as well as some heuristic designs of lower complexity. Simulation results show that IRS is able to significantly improve the SU rate, even for the scenarios deemed highly challenging in conventional CR systems without the IRS.","10.1109/lcomm.2020.2979709","3.0","Xinrong Guan; Qingqing Wu; Rui Zhang","2020.0","","","power; control; passive; beamforming; irs; assisted; spectrum"
"Census and survey of the visible internet","Prior measurement studies of the Internet have explored traffic and topology, but have largely ignored edge hosts. While the number of Internet hosts is very large, and many are hidden behind firewalls or in private address space, there is much to be learned from examining the population of visible hosts, those with public unicast addresses that respond to messages. In this paper we introduce two new approaches to explore the visible Internet. Applying statistical population sampling, we use censuses to walk the entire Internet address space, and surveys to probe frequently a fraction of that space. We then use these tools to evaluate address usage, where we find that only 3.6% of allocated addresses are actually occupied by visible hosts, and that occupancy is unevenly distributed, with a quarter of responsive /24 address blocks (subnets) less than 5% full, and only 9% of blocks more than half full. We show about 34 million addresses are very stable and visible to our probes (about 16% of responsive addresses), and we project from this up to 60 million stable Internet-accessible computers. The remainder of allocated addresses are used intermittently, with a median occupancy of 81 minutes. Finally, we show that many firewalls are visible, measuring significant diversity in the distribution of firewalled block size. To our knowledge, we are the first to take a census of edge hosts in the visible Internet since 1982, to evaluate the accuracy of active probing for address census and survey, and to quantify these aspects of the Internet.","10.1145/1452520.1452542","6.0","John Heidemann; Yuri Pradkin; Ramesh Govindan; Christos Papadopoulos; Genevieve Bartlett; J.

"Water supply and history: Harappa and the Beas regional survey","Introducing the methods of archaeoclimatology, the authors measure the relative locus of the monsoons, the intensity of winter rains and the volume of water in the rivers in the Upper Indus, in the region of Harappa. They also note the adoption of a multi-cropping agricultural system as a possible strategy designed to adjust to changing conditions over time. They find that around 3500 BC the volume of water in the rivers increases, and the rivers flood, implying annual soil refreshment and the consequent development of agriculture. By contrast, from around 2100 BC the river flow begins to fall while the winter rains increase. This time-bracket correlates nicely with the brief flourishing of Harappa. The locally derived evidence from Harappa combined with the Beas survey data provide a model for understanding the abandonment of settlements in the Upper Indus and possibly the wider civilisation.","10.1017/s0003598x00096423","3.0","R.

"THE EXOPLANET CENSUS: A GENERAL METHOD APPLIED TO<i>KEPLER</i>","We develop a general method to fit the planetary distribution function (PLDF) to exoplanet survey data. This maximum likelihood method accommodates more than one planet per star and any number of planet or target star properties. Application to \Kepler data relies on estimates of the efficiency of discovering transits around Solar type stars by Howard et al. (2011). These estimates are shown to agree with theoretical predictions for an ideal transit survey. Using announced \Kepler planet candidates, we fit the PLDF as a joint powerlaw in planet radius, down to 0.5 R_Eart, and orbital period, up to 50 days. The estimated number of planets per star in this sample is ~ 0.7 --- 1.4, where the broad range covers systematic uncertainties in the detection efficiency. To analyze trends in the PLDF we consider four planet samples, divided between shorter and longer periods at 7 days and between large and small radii at 3 R_Earth. At longer periods, the size distribution of the small planets, with index \alpha = -1.2 \pm 0.2 steepens to \alpha = -2.0 \pm 0.2 for the larger planet sample. For shorter periods, the opposite is seen: smaller planets follow a steep powerlaw, \alpha = -1.9 \pm 0.2 that is much shallower, \alpha = -0.7 \pm 0.2 at large radii. The observed deficit of intermediate-sized planets at the shortest periods may arise from the evaporation and sublimation of Neptune and Saturn-like planets. If the trend and explanation hold, it would be spectacular observational confirmation of the core accretion and migration hypotheses, and allow refinement of these theories.","10.1088/0004-637x/742/1/38","1.0","Andrew N.

"Quantifying Relative Diver Effects in Underwater Visual Censuses","Diver-based Underwater Visual Censuses (UVCs), particularly transect-based surveys, are key tools in the study of coral reef fish ecology. These techniques, however, have inherent problems that make it difficult to collect accurate numerical data. One of these problems is the diver effect (defined as the reaction of fish to a diver). Although widely recognised, its effects have yet to be quantified and the extent of taxonomic variation remains to be determined. We therefore examined relative diver effects on a reef fish assemblage on the Great Barrier Reef. Using common UVC methods, the recorded abundance of seven reef fish groups were significantly affected by the ongoing presence of SCUBA divers. Overall, the diver effect resulted in a 52% decrease in the mean number of individuals recorded, with declines of up to 70% in individual families. Although the diver effect appears to be a significant problem, UVCs remain a useful approach for quantifying spatial and temporal variation in relative fish abundances, especially if using methods that minimise the exposure of fishes to divers. Fixed distance transects using tapes or lines deployed by a second diver (or GPS-calibrated timed swims) would appear to maximise fish counts and minimise diver effects.","10.1371/journal.pone.0018965","4.0","Luke C.

"Status of the Archaeal and Bacterial Census: an Update","A census is typically carried out for people across a range of geographical levels; however, microbial ecologists have implemented a molecular census of bacteria and archaea by sequencing their 16S rRNA genes. We assessed how well the census of full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences is proceeding in the context of recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies because full-length sequences are typically used as references for classification of the short sequences generated by newer technologies. Among the 1,411,234 and 53,546 full-length bacterial and archaeal sequences, 94.5% and 95.1% of the bacterial and archaeal sequences, respectively, belonged to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that have been observed more than once. Although these metrics suggest that the census is approaching completion, 29.2% of the bacterial and 38.5% of the archaeal OTUs have been observed more than once. Thus, there is still considerable diversity to be explored. Unfortunately, the rate of new full-length sequences has been declining, and new sequences are primarily being deposited by a small number of studies. Furthermore, sequences from soil and aquatic environments, which are known to be rich in bacterial diversity, represent only 7.8 and 16.5% of the census, while sequences associated with host-associated environments represent 55.0% of the census. Continued use of traditional approaches and new technologies such as single-cell genomics and short-read assembly are likely to improve our ability to sample rare OTUs if it is possible to overcome this sampling bias. The success of ongoing efforts to use short-read sequencing to characterize archaeal and bacterial communities requires that researchers strive to expand the depth and breadth of this census.The biodiversity contained within the bacterial and archaeal domains dwarfs that of the eukaryotes, and the services these organisms provide to the biosphere are critical. Surprisingly, we have done a relatively poor job of formally tracking the quality of the biodiversity as represented in full-length 16S rRNA genes. By understanding how this census is proceeding, it is possible to suggest the best allocation of resources for advancing the census. We found that the ongoing effort has done an excellent job of sampling the most abundant organisms but struggles to sample the rarer organisms. Through the use of new sequencing technologies, we should be able to obtain full-length sequences from these rare organisms. Furthermore, we suggest that by allocating more resources to sampling environments known to have the greatest biodiversity, we will be able to make significant advances in our characterization of archaeal and bacterial diversity.","10.1128/mbio.00201-16","5.0","Patrick D.

"Censusing marine eukaryotic diversity in the twenty-first century","The ocean constitutes one of the vastest and richest biomes on our planet. Most recent estimations, all based on indirect approaches, suggest that there are millions of marine eukaryotic species. Moreover, a large majority of these are small (less than 1 mm), cryptic and still unknown to science. However, this knowledge gap, caused by the lack of diagnostic morphological features in small organisms and the limited sampling of the global ocean, is currently being filled, thanks to new DNA-based approaches. The molecular technique of PCR amplification of homologous gene regions combined with high-throughput sequencing, routinely used to census unculturable prokaryotes, is now also being used to characterize whole communities of marine eukaryotes. Here, we review how this methodological advancement has helped to better quantify the magnitude and patterns of marine eukaryotic diversity, with an emphasis on taxonomic groups previously largely overlooked. We then discuss obstacles remaining to achieve a global understanding of marine eukaryotic diversity. In particular, we argue that 18S variable regions do not provide sufficient taxonomic resolution to census marine life, and suggest combining broad eukaryotic surveys targeting the 18S rRNA region with more taxon-focused analyses of hypervariable regions to improve our understanding of the diversity of species, the functional units of marine ecosystems.This article is part of the themed issue 'From DNA barcodes to biomes'.","10.1098/rstb.2015.0331","2.0","Matthieu Leray; Nancy­ Knowlton­","2016.0","","","marine; diversity; twenty; century"

"Improving the open cluster census","Data from the Gaia satellite are revolutionising our understanding of the Milky Way. With every new data release, there is a need to update the census of open clusters. We aim to conduct a blind, all-sky search for open clusters using 729 million sources from Gaia DR3 down to magnitude $G\sim20$, creating a homogeneous catalogue of clusters including many new objects. We used the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) algorithm to recover clusters. We validated our clusters using a statistical density test and a Bayesian convolutional neural network for colour-magnitude diagram classification. We inferred basic astrometric parameters, ages, extinctions, and distances for the clusters in the catalogue. We recovered 7167 clusters, 2387 of which are candidate new objects and 4782 of which crossmatch to objects in the literature, including 134 globular clusters. A more stringent cut of our catalogue contains 4105 highly reliable clusters, 739 of which are new. Owing to the scope of our methodology, we are able to tentatively suggest that many of the clusters we are unable to detect may not be real, including 1152 clusters from the Milky Way Star Cluster (MWSC) catalogue that should have been detectable in Gaia data. Our cluster membership lists include many new members and often include tidal tails. Our catalogue's distribution traces the galactic warp, the spiral arm structure, and the dust distribution of the Milky Way. While much of the content of our catalogue contains bound open and globular clusters, as many as a few thousand of our clusters are more compatible with unbound moving groups, which we will classify in an upcoming work. We have conducted the largest search for open clusters to date, producing a single homogeneous star cluster catalogue which we make available with this paper.","10.1051/0004-6361/202346285","2.0","Emily L.

"A STELLAR ROTATION CENSUS OF B STARS: FROM ZAMS TO TAMS","Two recent observing campaigns provide us with moderate dispersion spectra of more than 230 cluster and 370 field B stars. Combining them and the spectra of the B stars from our previous investigations (∼430 cluster and ∼100 field B stars) yields a large, homogeneous sample for studying the rotational properties of B stars. We derive the projected rotational velocity Vsin i, effective temperature, gravity, mass, and critical rotation speed Vcrit for each star. We find that the average Vsin i is significantly lower among field stars because they are systematically more evolved and spun down than their cluster counterparts. The rotational distribution functions of Veq/Vcrit for the least evolved B stars show that lower mass B stars are born with a larger proportion of rapid rotators than higher mass B stars. However, the upper limit of Veq/Vcrit that may separate normal B stars from emission-line Be stars (where rotation promotes mass loss into a circumstellar disk) is smaller among the higher mass B stars. We compare the evolutionary trends of rotation (measured according to the polar gravity of the star) with recent models that treat internal mixing. The spin-down rates observed in the high-mass subset (∼9 M☉) agree with predictions, but the rates are larger for the low-mass group (∼3 M☉). The faster spin-down in the low-mass B stars matches well with the predictions based on conservation of angular momentum in individual spherical shells. Our results suggest that the fastest rotators (that probably correspond to the emission-line Be stars) are probably formed by evolutionary spin-up (for the more massive stars) and by mass transfer in binaries (for the full range of B star masses).","10.1088/0004-637x/722/1/605","3.0","Wenjin Huang; Douglas R.

"Seasonal Residential Water Demand Forecasting for Census Tracts","The paucity of readily available demographic, economic, and water consumption data at household levels has limited the application of disaggregate water demand models. This research develops regression-based water demand models capable of forecasting single-family residential water demands within individual census tracts at a bimonthly time-step. The regression models are estimated using 12 years of demographic, weather, economic, and metered bimonthly water consumption data associated with over 100 unique census tracts in Seattle, Washington. In general, the three regression methods perform well in replicating total single-family water consumption in the study region. Two regression models, a fixed effects model and a random effects model, provide better estimates of water demand within individual census tracts. Improved water demand forecasts at the spatial scale of census tracts provide policy makers and planners information useful for managing water resources. These proposed approaches allow examination of spatially distributed demands within systems, identify the value of targeted conservation and infrastructure development, and improve understanding of the variables impacting demand in heterogeneous areas. The coefficient estimates developed in this research are appropriate for use in spatially disaggregate urban simulation models.","10.1061/(asce)wr.1943-5452.0000003","2.0","Austin Polebitski; Richard N.

"Downregulated IRS-1 and PPARγ in obese women with gestational diabetes: relationship to FFA during pregnancy","Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with elevated postprandial free fatty acids (FFA) and insulin resistance; however, little is known about the cellular mechanisms underlying insulin resistance to suppress lipolysis during gestation. We evaluated the longitudinal changes in insulin suppression of FFA before pregnancy and in early (12–14 wk) and late (34–36 wk) gestation in obese subjects with normal glucose tolerance and in obese GDM subjects. Abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were also obtained during cesarean delivery from normal obese pregnant (Preg-Con), GDM, and nonpregnant obese control (Non-Preg-Con) subjects during gynecological surgery. GDM subjects had higher basal plasma FFA before pregnancy ( P = 0.055). Insulin's ability to suppress FFA levels declined from early to late gestation in both GDM and Preg-Con subjects and was significantly less in GDM subjects compared with Preg-Con subjects over time ( P = 0.025). Adipose tissue insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 protein levels were 43% lower ( P = 0.02) and p85α subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was twofold higher ( P = 0.03) in GDM compared with Preg-Con subjects. The levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) mRNA and protein were lower by 38% in Preg-Con ( P = 0.006) and by 48% in GDM subjects ( P = 0.005) compared with Non-Preg controls. Lipoprotein lipase and fatty acid-binding protein-2 mRNA levels were 73 and 52% lower in GDM compared with Preg-Con subjects ( P &lt; 0.002). Thus GDM women have decreased IRS-1, which may contribute to reduced insulin suppression of lipolysis with advancing gestation. Decreased PPARγ and its target genes may be part of the molecular mechanism to accelerate fat catabolism to meet fetal nutrient demand in late gestation.","10.1152/ajpendo.00124.2001","6.0","Patrick M.

"Census based deprivation indices: their weighting and validation.","KEY ISSUES--Over one hundred years of social science research has shown that different social groups have different probabilities of suffering from multiple deprivation; yet census based deprivation indices frequently assign equal weightings to each of their component variables. This becomes highly problematic when these indices are used as the basis for allocating resources to local and health authorities. In order to ensure fairness and accuracy in resource allocation these indices should be both weighted and validated. STUDY RESULTS--Weightings are derived from the Breadline Britain in the 1990s survey to produce a census based deprivation index that estimates the percentage of poor households at electoral ward level. Examples of validation methodology are discussed and the estimate of the proportion of poor households is shown to be highly correlated with both low income and morbidity as estimated from the 1991 census. DATA SOURCES--The 1991 census local base statistics (LBS) and small area statistics (SAS) aggregated for the 8519 electoral wards of England. The Breadline Britain in the 1990s survey: a nationally representative survey of 1831 households specifically designed to measure poverty and multiple deprivation.","10.1136/jech.49.suppl_2.s39","1.0","David Gordon","1995.0","","","census; deprivation; indices; weighting; validation"
"Interprovincial Migration, Population Redistribution, and Regional Development in China: 1990 and 2000 Census Comparisons","Abstract Until recently, migration has had a limited role to play in China's space economy because of central-planning logic and mechanisms. Mobility increases and economic restructuring since the 1980s, however, call for new conceptualizations of migration. Using interprovincial migration data from China's 1990 and 2000 censuses, I analyze migration rates, migration effectiveness, population growth, net migration flows, and spatial focusing of migration. The analysis supports the notions that migration is an increasingly effective factor of population redistribution and that it has a strong relationship with regional development. While these relationships have been documented in many other parts of the world, they have been less well addressed in the case of China. Regional divergence in economic development during the 1990s was accompanied by a marked increase in interprovincial migration and sharply concentrated migration flows, especially from relatively poor central and western provinces to the rapidly growing eastern region. These results suggest that migration theories that draw from experiences of capitalist economies may be of increased relevance to China.","10.1111/j.0033-0124.2005.00479.x","1.0","C.

"Measuring the quality of life in city of Indianapolis by integration of remote sensing and census data","This paper develops a methodology for integration of remote sensing and census data within a GIS framework to assess the quality of life in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. Environmental variables, i.e. greenness, impervious surface and temperature, were derived from a Landsat ETM+ image. Socio‐economic variables, including population density, income, poverty, employment rate, education level and house characteristics from US census 2000, were integrated with the environmental variables at the block group level to derive indicators of quality of life. Pearson's correlation was computed to analyse the relationships among the variables. Further, factor analysis was conducted to extract unique information from the combined dataset. Three factors were identified and interpreted as material welfare, environmental conditions and crowdedness respectively. Each factor was viewed as a unique aspect of the quality of life. A synthetic index of the urban quality of life was created and mapped based on weighted factor scores of the three factors. Finally, regression models were built to estimate the quality of life in the city of Indianapolis based on selected environmental and socioeconomic variables.","10.1080/01431160600735624","2.0","G.

"A Census-Based Count of the Civil War Dead","A Census-Based Count of the Civil War Dead J. David Hacker (bio) Counting the Civil War Dead For more than five decades, Civil War History has served as the leading venue for scholarly publications on the Civil War era. Even in light of this impressive run, the editors of Civil War History feel that the following contribution by J. David Hacker of Binghamton University, SUNY, stands among the most consequential pieces ever to appear in this journal’s pages. Hacker, a specialist in quantitative methods, has utilized recently released microdata samples from nineteenth-century censuses to examine one of the archetypal “facts” about the Civil War—the oft-cited total of 620,000 plus deaths. Through a comparison of male survival rates between 1860 and 1870 with male survival rates in surrounding censuses, Hacker finds the traditional statistic understates the number of actual Civil War deaths by approximately 20 percent. In his estimation, the most probable number of deaths attributable to the Civil War is 752,000, although the upper bounds of his data set point to as many as 851,000 deaths. As an exercise in the recalculation of a statistic, “Counting the Civil War Dead” might be regarded by skeptics either as a form of what Thomas Kuhn [End Page 307] described as “normal science” or as a misleading evocation of numeracy that belies the constructed nature of statistics. Such readings, we believe, miss the mark. “Counting the Civil War Dead” does more than modify a hoary bit of Civil War trivia; instead, it implicitly asks us to consider several questions that lie at the heart of the modern historical enterprise. How do “facts” emerge and become accepted by the profession writ large? How does the inevitably limited nature of historical evidence constrain our thinking about the past—and can we ever transcend these limits? Simply put, can we ever count the Civil War dead? As readers will soon discover, the practical answer is no. The use of the most sophisticated tools of quantitative analysis can certainly overturn what was once accepted wisdom, but, in the final analysis, they can only provide us with a probabilistic range of excess male deaths during the 1860s.1 In a very real sense, however, fixating upon a precise number obscures the actual meaning of the numbers, as scholars such as William Blair, David Blight, Jane Turner Censer, Drew Gilpin Faust, Barbara Gannon, Caroline Janney, Stuart McConnell, and John Neff have clearly established the central roles occupied by loss and trauma in postbellum America. By placing the Civil War’s enormous death toll at the center of the postwar world, this generation of scholarship forces us to stop and reconsider the war’s meaning for period Americans. And since, as Hacker implies, the majority of the uncounted dead were likely southerners (thanks to deficiencies in Confederate record-keeping and the troubled postwar condition of the south), the “ghosts of the Confederacy” now seem more numerous and persistent than ever. In terms of the scale of the carnage, Richmond in 1865 was Paris in 1918. Thus, what you are about to read takes us to “the frontiers of historical imagination” (to borrow a phrase from Kerwin Klein) and serves as a reminder that for all we know about the Civil War, there is still plenty that we do not—and can never—know. To prepare us for this journey, James McPherson has graciously provided this commentary on Hacker’s work. [End Page 308] Commentary on “A Census-Based Count of the Civil War Dead” by James M. McPherson I have been waiting more than twenty-five years for an article like this one. As I was working on my two syntheses of the Civil War era, Ordeal by Fire and Battle Cry of Freedom, I became increasingly aware that the standard estimate of 258,000 Confederate war dead was a significant undercount. Many Confederate records were lost or incomplete, especially for the last—and bloodiest—year of the war. The number of disease-related deaths of Confederate soldiers was clearly underreported. There were no reported Confederate noncombat deaths from “miscellaneous” causes—accidents, drownings, causes not stated, et cetera—compared with nearly twenty...","10.1353/cwh.2011.0061","1.0","J.

However, questions about the quality of the data continue to be of concern. This study of 350 nonprofit organizations investigates the adequacy, reliability, and appropriate interpretation of IRS 990 Return data through comparisons of selected entries with corresponding measures from each organization’s audited financial statements. Both quantitative and qualitative methods are used to examine and explain the consistency between the two data sources.

"A Disk Census for Young Brown Dwarfs","Recent surveys have identified substellar objects down to planetary masses in nearby star-forming regions. Reliable determination of the disk frequency in young brown dwarfs is of paramount importance to understanding their origin. Here we report the results of a systematic study of infrared L-band (3.8 μm) disk excess in ∼50 spectroscopically confirmed objects near and below the substellar boundary in several young clusters. Our observations, using the ESO Very Large Telescope, Keck I, and the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, reveal that a significant fraction of brown dwarfs harbor disks at a very young age. Their inner disk lifetimes do not appear to be vastly different from those of disks around T Tauri stars. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that substellar objects form via a mechanism similar to solar-mass stars.","10.1086/377144","4.0","Ray Jayawardhana; D. R. Ardila; B. Stelzer; Karl E.

Standardized rates for schizophrenia, corrected for age- and gender-related under-reporting in the 1991 census and a 20% underestimate of the size of the ethnic minority populations in the area, were not only higher in the Afro-Caribbean group (SMR: 3·1; 95% Cl: 2·0–4·7), but also in the African group (SMR: 4·2; 95% Cl: 2·8–6·2). It was further found that higher rates were not specific to schizophrenia. These findings suggest that some common factor associated with ethnic minority membership is important in producing an excess of psychotic illness.","10.1017/s0033291700033845","5.0","Jim van Os; David Castle; N Takei; Geoff Der; Robin M.

"Cooperative Beam Routing for Multi-IRS Aided Communication","Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has been deemed as a transformative technology to achieve smart and reconfigurable environment for wireless communication. This letter studies a new IRS-aided communication system, where multiple IRSs assist in the communication between a multi-antenna base station (BS) and a remote single-antenna user by multi-hop signal reflection. Specifically, by exploiting the line-of-sight (LoS) link between nearby IRSs, a multi-hop cascaded LoS link between the BS and user is established where a set of IRSs are selected to successively reflect the BS's signal, so that the received signal power at the user is maximized. To tackle this new problem, we first present the closed-form solutions for the optimal active and cooperative passive beamforming at the BS and selected IRSs, respectively, for a given beam route. Then, we derive the end-to-end channel power, which unveils a fundamental trade-off in the optimal beam routing design between maximizing the multiplicative passive beamforming gain and minimizing the multi-reflection path loss. To reconcile this trade-off, we recast the IRS selection and beam routing problem as an equivalent shortest simple-path problem in graph theory and solve it optimally. Numerical results show significant performance gains of the proposed algorithm over benchmark schemes and also draw useful insights into the optimal beam routing design.","10.1109/lwc.2020.3034370","2.0","Weidong Mei; Rui Zhang","2020.0","","","beam; routing; multi; irs; aided; communication"
"Unemployment and mortality: comparison of the 1971 and 1981 longitudinal study census samples.","Mortality in the period 1981-3 among men in the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys longitudinal study who were seeking work in 1981 was examined to investigate whether the finding of a high mortality rate among a comparable group of men who were followed up from the 1971 Census was repeated despite appreciable changes in the size and structure of the labour force over the intervening years. The pattern of mortality shortly after both censuses suggests that sick unemployed men were not categorised as seeking work, and it is concluded that for both samples the mortality of those who were reported to be seeking work was raised for reasons other than initial poor health. Other findings from the two censuses are also broadly similar. If confirmed after longer follow up this will add considerably to the evidence of the adverse health consequences of unemployment.","10.1136/bmj.294.6564.86","4.0","Kath Moser; Peter Goldblatt; A J Fox; David R.

"IRS-Enhanced OFDMA: Joint Resource Allocation and Passive Beamforming Optimization","Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is an emerging technique to enhance the wireless communication spectral efficiency with low hardware and energy cost. In this letter, we consider the integration of IRS to an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based multiuser downlink communication system, and study the pertinent joint optimization of the IRS reflection coefficients and OFDMA time-frequency resource block as well as power allocations to maximize the users' common (minimum) rate. Specifically, due to the lack of frequency-selective passive beamforming capability at the IRS, only one set of reflection coefficients can be designed for adapting to a large number of channels of multiple users over different frequency sub-bands. To tackle this difficulty, we propose a novel dynamic passive beamforming scheme where the IRS reflection coefficients are dynamically adjusted over different time slots within each channel coherence block to create artificial time-varying channels and select only a subset of the users to be simultaneously served in each time slot, thus achieving a higher passive beamforming gain. Although the formulated optimization problem is non-convex, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution to it. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the system common rate over the setup without IRS and that with random IRS reflection coefficients. Moreover, our proposed dynamic passive beamforming outperforms the fixed passive beamforming which employs a common set of reflection coefficients in each channel coherence block, by more flexibly balancing between passive beamforming and multiuser diversity gains.","10.1109/lwc.2020.2968303","3.0","Yifei Yang; Shuowen Zhang; Rui Zhang","2020.0","","","irs; enhanced; ofdma; joint; resource; allocation; passive; beamforming; optimization"
"Steaming of Zeolite BEA and Its Effect on Acidity: A Comparative NMR and IR Spectroscopic Study","The kinetics and impact of steaming on the acid site concentration of zeolite beta were studied by 1H, 27Al, and 29Si MAS NMR spectroscopy as well as IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine and temperature-programmed desorption of NH3. The main effects of steaming were the dealumination of the T3−T9 sites, the formation and migration of extra-framework Al species, and the healing of defect sites by condensation of silanol groups. These effects took place mainly in the first five hours of steaming, while after 14 h of steaming the system appeared to be stabilized. The concentration of framework Al atoms detected by 27Al MAS NMR spectroscopy is significantly higher than the concentration of Brønsted acid sites determined by 1H MAS NMR spectroscopy as well as by the sorption of basic probe molecules such as NH3 and pyridine. This shows conclusively that extra-framework Al oxide/hydroxide species act as cations balancing the framework charge. The concentration of extra-framework Al atoms matches the discrepancy between the concentration of framework Al atoms and the concentration of Brønsted acid sites indicating that each charge balancing entity contains only one aluminum.","10.1021/jp108338g","3.0","Sarah M.

"Energy Efficiency in Secure IRS-Aided SWIPT","This letter studies the energy efficiency (EE) in a secure intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) network, where an access point (AP) serves information decoding receivers (IDRs) and energy harvesting receivers (EHRs) assisted by an IRS. An optimization problem is formulated to maximize the system EE by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming vectors at the AP, the artificial noise (AN) covariance matrix at the AP, and the phase shifts at the IRS. To handle the non-convex problem, semi-definite relaxation (SDR) is adopted and then an efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization (AO) is proposed to obtain the suboptimal solution. Simulation results show that the system EE is significantly enhanced by employing IRS and optimizing AN. Moreover, EE firstly increases and then decreases with the increment of the number of reflecting elements. Additionally, the system EE decreases with the increment of the circuit power consumed by both the AP and the IRS.","10.1109/lwc.2020.3006837","6.0","Jingxian Liu; Ke Xiong; Yang Lu; Derrick Wing Kwan Ng; Zhangdui Zhong; Zhu Han","2020.0","","","energy; efficiency; secure; irs; swipt"

"Census of seafloor sediments in the world’s ocean","Knowing the patterns of distribution of sediments in the global ocean is critical for understanding biogeochemical cycles and how deep-sea deposits respond to environmental change at the sea surface. We present the first digital map of seafloor lithologies based on descriptions of nearly 14,500 samples from original cruise reports, interpolated using a support vector machine algorithm. We show that sediment distribution is more complex, with significant deviations from earlier hand-drawn maps, and that major lithologies occur in drastically different proportions globally. By coupling our digital map to oceanographic data sets, we find that the global occurrence of biogenic oozes is strongly linked to specific ranges in sea-surface parameters. In particular, by using recent computations of diatom distributions from pigment-calibrated chlorophyll-a satellite data, we show that, contrary to a widely held view, diatom oozes are not a reliable proxy for surface productivity. Their global accumulation is instead strongly dependent on low surface temperature (0.9–5.7 °C) and salinity (33.8–34.0 PSS, Practical Salinity Scale 1978) and high concentrations of nutrients. Under these conditions, diatom oozes will accumulate on the seafloor regardless of surface productivity as long as there is limited competition from biogenous and detrital components, and diatom frustules are not significantly dissolved prior to preservation. Quantifying the link between the seafloor and the sea surface through the use of large digital data sets will ultimately lead to more robust reconstructions and predictions of climate change and its impact on the ocean environment.","10.1130/g36883.1","4.0","Adriana Dutkiewicz; R.

"YMXM motifs of IRS-1 define substrate specificity of the insulin receptor kinase.","Of 34 tyrosine residues in insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), 14 are adjacent to acidic residues, suggesting that they might be phosphorylation sites. Synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences surrounding these tyrosines were used as substrates of the insulin receptor kinase. Surprisingly six of these, each within YMXM motifs, were phosphorylated with greatest efficiency (Km, 24-92 microM; kcat/Km, 0.6-2.1 x 10(4) M-1.sec-1). Substituted YMXM peptides revealed a strong preference of the insulin receptor kinase for methionine at Y + 1 and Y + 3 positions. When phosphorylated, related YMXM sequences are recognition motifs for binding to proteins with src-homology (SH2) domains. The combined hydrophobic and flexible nature of methionine side chains adjacent to the targeted tyrosines provides a versatile contact for recognition by diverse proteins involved in signal transduction.","10.1073/pnas.89.6.2027","4.0","Steven E.

"Genotoxicity of polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated silver nanoparticles in BEAS 2B cells","Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are widely utilized in various consumer products and medical devices, especially due to their antimicrobial properties. However, several studies have associated these particles with toxic effects, such as inflammation and oxidative stress in vivo and cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in vitro. Here, we assessed the genotoxic effects of AgNPs coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (average diameter 42.5±14.5 nm) on human bronchial epithelial BEAS 2B cells in vitro. AgNPs were dispersed in bronchial epithelial growth medium (BEGM) with 0.6 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA). The AgNP were partially well-dispersed in the medium and only limited amounts (ca. 0.02 μg Ag(+) ion/l) could be dissolved after 24h. The zeta-potential of the AgNPs was found to be highly negative in pure water but was at least partially neutralized in BEGM with 0.6 mg BSA/ml. Cytotoxicity was measured by cell number count utilizing Trypan Blue exclusion and by an ATP-based luminescence cell viability assay. Genotoxicity was assessed by the alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay, the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (MN) assay, and the chromosomal aberration (CA) assay. The cells were exposed to various doses (0.5-48 μg/cm(2) corresponding to 2.5-240 μg/ml) of AgNPs for 4 and 24 h in the comet assay, for 48 h in the MN assay, and for 24 and 48 h in the CA assay. DNA damage measured by the percent of DNA in comet tail was induced in a dose-dependent manner after both the 4-h and the 24-h exposures to AgNPs, with a statistically significant increase starting at 16 μg/cm(2) (corresponding to 60.8 μg/ml) and doubling of the percentage of DNA in tail at 48 μg/cm(2). However, no induction of MN or CAs was observed at any of the doses or time points. The lack of induction of chromosome damage by the PVP-coated AgNPs is possibly due to the coating which may protect the cells from direct interaction with the AgNPs, either by reducing ion leaching from the particles or by causing extensive agglomeration of the nanoparticles, with a possible reduction of the cellular uptake.","10.1016/j.tox.2012.09.014","10.0","Penny Nymark; Julia Catalán; Satu Suhonen; Hilkka Järventaus; Renie Birkedal; Per Axel Clausen; Keld Alstrup Jensen; Minnamari Vippola; Kai Savolainen; Hannu Norppa","2012.0","","","genotoxicity; polyvinylpyrrolidone; silver; nanoparticles; beas; b; cells"
"Using Census and Survey Data to Estimate Poverty and Inequality for Small Areas","Recent years have seen widespread use of small-area maps based on census data enriched by relationships estimated from household surveys that predict variables, such as income, not covered by the census. The purpose is to obtain putatively precise estimates of poverty and inequality for small areas for which no or few observations are available in the survey. We argue that to usefully match survey and census data in this way requires a degree of spatial homogeneity for which the method provides no basis and which is unlikely to be satisfied in practice. We document the potential empirical relevance of such concerns using data from the 2000 census of Mexico.","10.1162/rest.91.4.773","2.0","Alessandro Tarozzi; Angus Deaton","2009.0","","","census; survey; estimate; poverty; inequality; small; areas"
"Review of DNA‐based census and effective population size estimators","Abstract The detection of reductions in effective population size ( N e ) or census size ( N c ) is essential for conservation. Recent developments allow wildlife researchers to obtain genetic material via non‐invasive sampling techniques that may provide the large sample sizes necessary for precise estimates of N e and N c . Population genetic theory provides several methods to estimate N e from allele frequency data: including temporal change in allele frequencies, gametic disequilibrium and heterozygote excess methods. Modification of capture–mark–recapture methods for use with multi‐locus genotype data provides new means for estimating N c . The combination of new DNA sampling techniques, polymerase chain reaction‐based DNA markers and analytical methods may provide unprecedented power to detect reductions in N e and N c of endangered populations. However, these genetic methods are largely untested in the field. We review some relatively unexplored, but promising ways that multi‐locus genetic data can be used to provide important genetic and demographic information and suggest avenues for further research in this area.","10.1111/j.1469-1795.1998.tb00040.x","3.0","Michael K.

"Advances in Record-Linkage Methodology as Applied to Matching the 1985 Census of Tampa, Florida","Abstract A test census of Tampa, Florida and an independent postenumeration survey (PES) were conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau in 1985. The PES was a stratified block sample with heavy emphasis placed on hard-to-count population groups. Matching the individuals in the census to the individuals in the PES is an important aspect of census coverage evaluation and consequently a very important process for any census adjustment operations that might be planned. For such an adjustment to be feasible, record-linkage software had to be developed that could perform matches with a high degree of accuracy and that was based on an underlying mathematical theory. A principal purpose of the PES was to provide an opportunity to evaluate the newly implemented record-linkage system and associated methodology. This article discusses the theoretical and practical issues encountered in conducting the matching operation and presents the results of that operation. A review of the theoretical background of the record-linkage problem provides a framework for discussions of the decision procedure, file blocking, and the independence assumption. The estimation of the parameters required by the decision procedure is an important aspect of the methodology, and the techniques presented provide a practical system that is easily implemented. The matching algorithm (discussed in detail) uses the linear sum assignment model to ""pair"" the records. The Tampa, Florida, matching methodology is described in the final sections of the article. Included in the discussion are the results of the matching itself, an independent clerical review of the matches and nonmatches, conclusions, problem areas, and future work required.","10.2307/2289924","1.0","Matthew A.

"A census of metals and baryons in stars in the local Universe","We combine stellar metallicity and stellar mass estimates for a large sample of galaxies drawn from the SDSS DR2 spanning wide ranges in physical properties, in order to derive an inventory of the total mass of metals and baryons locked up in stars today. Physical parameter estimates are derived from galaxy spectra with high S/N (>20). Coadded spectra of galaxies with similar velocity dispersions, absolute r-band magnitudes and 4000\AA-break values are used for those regions of parameter space where individual spectra have lower S/N. We estimate the total density of metals and of baryons in stars and, from these two quantities, we obtain a mass- and volume-averaged stellar metallicity of <Z_star>=1.04+-0.14 Z_sun, i.e. consistent with solar. We also study how metals are distributed in galaxies according to their mass, morphology and age, and we then compare these distributions with the corresponding distributions of stellar mass. We find that the bulk of metals locked up in stars in the local Universe reside in massive, bulge-dominated galaxies, with red colours and high 4000\AA-break values corresponding to old stellar populations. Bulge-dominated and disc-dominated galaxies contribute similar amounts to the total stellar mass density, but have different fractional contributions to the mass density of metals in stars, in agreement with the mass-metallicity relation. Bulge-dominated galaxies contain roughly 40% of the total amount of metals in stars, while disc-dominated galaxies less than 25%. Finally, at a given galaxy stellar mass, we define two characteristic ages as the median of the distributions of mass and metals as a function of age. These characteristic ages decrease progressively from high-mass to low-mass galaxies, consistent with the high formation epochs of stars in massive galaxies.","10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12632.x","4.0","Anna Gallazzi; J.

"A Census of rRNA Genes and Linked Genomic Sequences within a Soil Metagenomic Library","ABSTRACT We have analyzed the diversity of microbial genomes represented in a library of metagenomic DNA from soil. A total of 24,400 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones were screened for 16S rRNA genes. The sequences obtained from BAC clones were compared with a collection generated by direct PCR amplification and cloning of 16S rRNA genes from the same soil. The results indicated that the BAC library had substantially lower representation of bacteria among the Bacillus , α- Proteobacteria , and CFB groups; greater representation among the β- and γ- Proteobacteria , and OP10 divisions; and no rRNA genes from the domains Eukaryota and Archaea . In addition to rRNA genes recovered from the bacterial divisions Proteobacteria , Verrucomicrobia , Firmicutes , Cytophagales , and OP11 , we identified many rRNA genes from the BAC library affiliated with the bacterial division Acidobacterium ; all of these sequences were affiliated with subdivisions that lack cultured representatives. The complete sequence of one BAC clone derived from a member of the Acidobacterium division revealed a complete rRNA operon and 20 other open reading frames, including predicted gene products involved in cell division, cell cycling, folic acid biosynthesis, substrate metabolism, amino acid uptake, DNA repair, and transcriptional regulation. This study is the first step in using genomics to reveal the physiology of as-yet-uncultured members of the Acidobacterium division.","10.1128/aem.69.5.2684-2691.2003","5.0","Mark R. Liles; Brian F.

"The Lebanese census of 1932 revisited. Who are the Lebanese?","Abstract The Lebanese state is analysed as a membership organization where both formal‐legal and political objectives control admission. The 1932 census played a fundamental role in the state‐building process of the Lebanese state: political representation was based on its findings, it was the basis for personal registration of the population residing on Lebanese territories, and it formed one of the cornerstones for obtaining citizenship in the Lebanese state. This article shows that the way the census figures were presented and analysed embodies issues of contest regarding the identity of the Lebanese state and who its members should be. The restrictive citizenship policy practised by the Maronite‐dominated regime until the outbreak of the civil war in 1975 is understood as a means to sustain political domination in an ethnically divided society. Lebanon provides an example of the political sensitivity of demographic figures in polities where fixed proportional representation constitutes the main principle of representative political organization.","10.1080/13530199908705684","1.0","Rania Maktabi","1999.0","","","census; who"

"Censuses, identity formation, and the struggle for political power","The past decade has seen a great outpouring of interest in the nature of collective identities of various kinds. Within the United States, both popular and academic interest in identities that divide the population have not only spawned heated debates but have also had substantial social consequences and public policy implications. Fueled in part by the legacy of racism and the still daunting problems of racial division, and nurtured as well by recent and ongoing waves of immigration, the issue is frequently framed in terms of ""multiculturalism."" In this version, the American population is presumably divided into a fixed number of different ""cultures,"" each deserving of equal respect and some, perhaps, deserving of special aid.","10.1017/cbo9780511606045.002","2.0","David I.

"China's Urbanization Levels: Reconstructing a Baseline from the Fifth Population Census","China's fifth population census taken on 1 November 2000 reveals that the mainland had a total population of 1,265.83 million, of which 455.94 million were urban residents ( chengzhen renkou ). This suggests that the level of urbanization was 36.09 per cent. Whereas this is a reasonable figure that appears to fit well the general rising trend of urbanization shown in the previous four censuses, the levels of urbanization reported in the five censuses are not really comparable because the criteria used to enumerate “urban” population have been different for different censuses. Before the State Statistical Bureau produces a set of comparable figures on the levels of China's urbanization based on a set of uniform criteria, the problem of data incomparability concerning the levels of urbanization will continue to baffle users. This report analyses the statistical criteria defining China's urban population used in the 2000 census, compares them with the criteria of the previous censuses and presents two sets of adjusted and internally coherent time-series data to remedy the problem of data incomparability.","10.1017/s000944390300010x","2.0","Yixing Zhou; J.

"Tropical forest tree mortality, recruitment and turnover rates: calculation, interpretation and comparison when census intervals vary","Summary Mathematical proofs show that rate estimates, for example of mortality and recruitment, will decrease with increasing census interval when obtained from censuses of non‐homogeneous populations. This census interval effect could be confounding or perhaps even driving conclusions from comparative studies involving such rate estimates. We quantify this artefact for tropical forest trees, develop correction methods and re‐assess some previously published conclusions about forest dynamics. Mortality rates of &gt; 50 species at each of seven sites in Africa, Latin America, Asia and Australia were used as subpopulations to simulate stand‐level mortality rates in a heterogeneous population when census intervals varied: all sites showed decreasing stand mortality rates with increasing census interval length. Stand‐level mortality rates from 14 multicensus long‐term forest plots from Africa, Latin America, Asia and Australia also showed that, on average, mortality rates decreased with increasing census interval length. Mortality, recruitment or turnover rates with differing census interval lengths can be compared using the mean rate of decline from the 14 long‐term plots to standardize estimates to a common census length using λ corr = λ × t 0.08 , where λ is the rate and t is time between censuses in years. This simple general correction should reduce the bias associated with census interval variation, where it is unavoidable. Re‐analysis of published results shows that the pan‐tropical increase in stem turnover rates over the late 20th century cannot be attributed to combining data with differing census intervals. In addition, after correction, Old World tropical forests do not have significantly lower turnover rates than New World sites, as previously reported. Our pan‐tropical best estimate adjusted stem turnover rate is 1.81 ± 0.16% a −1 (mean ± 95% CI, n = 65). As differing census intervals affect comparisons of mortality, recruitment and turnover rates, and can lead to erroneous conclusions, standardized field methods, the calculation of local correction factors at sites where adequate data are available, or the use of our general standardizing formula to take account of sample intervals, are to be recommended.","10.1111/j.0022-0477.2004.00923.x","18.0","Simon L.

"Who counts?: the politics of census-taking in contemporary America","This article describes some of the legal decisions and problems among politicians and demographers who produce US census counts of population. The impact of the US Supreme Court hearing and decision in Wisconsin vs New York is discussed followed by an analysis of the Census Bureaus plans for the Census in 2000. Census procedures have been challenged since 1988. Litigation forced the use of the Post Enumeration Survey for adjusting the 1990 Census but the Census Director in 1991 issued a recommendation for not adjusting the 1990 counts that was affirmed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in April 1993. Oral arguments were heard in the aforementioned New York case on January 10 1996. New York argued for the implementation of dual system estimation due to undercounting errors that were probably influenced by actions of Republican Commerce officials during the 1980s that prevented improvements in census counting. It was charged that Census Bureau methods violated the intent of Article 1 Section 2 of the Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection. Lawsuits challenged the Bureau to develop methods that would reduce the undercount of minorities and the urban poor. Other arguments of the state of Oklahoma Wisconsin the federal government for the Secretary of Commerce and New York City are summarized. The Solicitor General of the US Drew Days argued that the true total population of the US was unknown and unknowable and that the Secretary of Commerce had the authority to make decisions about the census. The main issue before the court became who had the authority to decide not to adjust. All of the US Supreme Court judges voted on March 20 1996 in favor of unadjusted census counts. The issue of statistical adjustment methods as a violation of the Constitution was not decided. Plans for the census of 2000 include reducing costs and increasing accuracy through a three-stage count strategy.","10.5860/choice.37-4794","0.0","","2000.0","Wisconsin","","politics; census; america"

"Regional Analysis Using Census Bureau Microdata at the Center for Economic Studies","Regional science research requires data sets with detailed geography. Dissemination of data sets with sufficient geographic specificity challenges statistical agencies in terms of protecting respondent privacy. The U.S. Census Bureau first released decennial census microdata in the 1960s. Today, public versions of largely demographic surveys enjoy widespread use but limit the geographic detail of individual observations. With business data, firm and establishment distributions are highly skewed, preventing release of public use microdata versions. To support its own statistical programs by giving external researchers access to internal versions of public use data files, the Census Bureau created the Center for Economic Studies (CES) and a national network of Research Data Centers (RDCs). This model permits researchers access to confidential economic and demographic data under secure, controlled conditions. This article describes the CES-RDC enterprise, provides descriptions of available data sets and their spatial identifiers, and outlines issues and challenges facing the RDC network.","10.1177/0160017606289898","2.0","James C.

"Subaru Deep Survey. V. A Census of Lyman Break Galaxies at<i>z</i> ≃ 4 and 5 in the Subaru Deep Fields: Photometric Properties","We investigate the photometric properties of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at z = 3.5-5.2 based on large samples of 2600 LBGs detected in deep (i' ≲ 27) and wide-field (1200 arcmin2) images taken in the Subaru Deep Field (SDF) and the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Field (SXDF) using broadband B, V, R, i', and z' filters. The selection criteria for the LBG samples are examined with 85 spectroscopically identified objects, and the completeness and contamination of the samples are estimated from Monte Carlo simulations based on a photometric-redshift catalog of the Hubble Deep Field-North. We find that these LBG samples are nearly rest-frame UV magnitude-limited samples, missing systematically only 10% of red high-z galaxies (in number), which are a dusty population with E(B - V) ≳ 0.4. We calculate luminosity functions (LFs) of the LBGs with the estimated completeness and contamination and find (1) that the number density of bright galaxies (M1700 < -22 ; corresponding to SFR ≳ 100 h M☉ yr-1 with extinction correction) decreases significantly from z = 4 to 5 and (2) that the faint-end slope of the LFs of LBGs may become steeper toward higher redshifts. We estimate the dust extinction of z ≃ 4 LBGs with M < M* (≃-21) from UV-continuum slopes and obtain E(B - V) = 0.15 ± 0.03 as the mean value. The dust extinction remains constant with apparent luminosity but increases with intrinsic (i.e., extinction-corrected) luminosity. We find no evolution in dust extinction between LBGs at z = 3 and 4. We investigate the evolution of UV-luminosity density by integrating the LFs of LBGs and find that the UV-luminosity density at 1700 Å, ρUV, does not significantly change from z = 3 to 5, i.e., ρUV(z = 4)/ρUV(z = 3) = 1.0 ± 0.2 and ρUV(z = 5)/ρUV(z = 3) = 0.8 ± 0.4; thus, the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) density (with correction for dust extinction) remains constant within the error bars, or possibly has a slight decline, from z = 3 to 5. We estimate the stellar mass density from the cosmic SFR thus obtained and find that this stellar mass density is consistent with those derived directly from the stellar mass function at z = 0-1 but exceeds those at z ~ 3 by a factor of 3. We find that the ratio of the UV-luminosity density of Lyα emitters (LAEs) to that of LBGs is ≃60% at z ≃ 5, and thus about half of star formation probably occurs in LAEs at z ≃ 5. We obtain a constraint on the escape fraction of UV ionizing photons (i.e., UV continuum in 900 Å) produced by LBGs, fesc ≳ 0.13. This implies that the escape fraction of LBGs may be larger than that of star-forming galaxies at z = 0.","10.1086/422207","16.0","Masami Ouchi; Kazuhiro Shimasaku; Sadanori Okamura; Hisanori Furusawa; Nobunari Kashikawa; Kazuaki Ota; Mamoru Doi; M.

"The Racial Identification of Biracial Children with One Asian Parent: Evidence from the 1990 Census","This article examines the socioeconomic and demographic correlates that are associated with whether biracial children with an Asian parent are racially identified with their Asian parent or with their non-Asian parent. With data extracted from the 5-percent Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) of the 1990 census, we take into account explanatory variables at three levels: the child's characteristics, the parents' characteristics, and the locale's racial composition. Our results indicate that the racial identification of biracial children with an Asian parent is to a large extent an arbitrary option within today's prevailing racial classification scheme. We find empirical evidence in support of the theoretical proposition that both assimilation and awareness of Asian heritage affect the racial identification of biracial children with an Asian parent.","10.1093/sf/76.2.547","2.0","Yuan Xie; Kimberly A.

"An approach to linking remotely sensed data and areal census data","With the increasing availability of remotely sensed data and census data, discussing their relationship is one of the important issues in GIS data integration. This paper proposed an approach to linking three levels (macro, medium and micro) of land classifications with areal census data on hierarchical census boundaries. Specifically, a method of building the correlations between areal census dwelling data and residential densities classified by a remote sensing approach was demonstrated. First, a texture statistic (homogeneity) along with six Thematic Mapper (TM) bands (bands 1-5 and 7) was put together to classify residential density levels. The homogeneity slightly enhanced classification accuracy. Then, to test the correlations between census dwelling data and residential densities, a multiple linear regression was conducted. It was found that areal census dwelling data had higher correlations with areas of different residential densities than with the aggregated area of a whole residential area at an individual census zone level. Finally, the paper discussed that dis-aggregation of areal census data based on dwelling densities within the framework of remote sensing and GIS would be very useful for multidisciplinary studies, such as natural hazards risk assessment.","10.1080/01431160010014297","1.0","K.

By contrast, the sex ratios of eldest and younger children with an older brother were both within the range of the biologically normal, as were White offspring sex ratios (irrespective of the elder siblings' sex).

"Nationwide census of gorilla (<i>gorilla g. gorilla</i>) and chimpanzee (<i>Pan t. troglodytes</i>) populations in Gabon","A census was made of gorilla and chimpanzee populations throughout Gabon between December 1980 and February 1983. The aim of the census was to estimate the total numbers of both species and describe their distributions. The method was based on nest counts from line transects which allowed the calculation of population densities of all individuals except suckling infants. Fifteen types of habitat were recognized and defined in terms of their structural features. In the initial phase of the study we did transects in each habitat-type and computed mean densities for each species in each habitat-type. In the second phase of the study we estimated the sizes of gorilla and chimpanzee populations throughout the country by extrapolation from these population density values. We did transects in all areas of the country and conducted interviews to check the accuracy of the population totals obtained by extrapolation. Corrections were made to the extrapolated totals to take into account different levels of hunting pressure and other human activities found to modify ape population densities. Total populations of 34,764 gorillas and 64,173 chimpanzees were estimated. An error of ± 20% was associated with the estimated population totals, which allows the conclusion that Gabon contains 35,000 ± 7,000 gorillas and 64,000 ± 13,000 chimpanzees. The figure for gorillas is much larger than previous estimates. This seems to be because (1) gorillas occur in almost all types of forest and are not restricted to man-made secondary forest as had been though; and (2) the geographical distribution of gorillas in Gabon is wider than previously believed. Gabon's large areas of undisturbed primary forest offer exceptional potential for conservation, not only of gorillas and chimpanzees, but also of the intact tropical rain forest ecosystems which they inhabit.","10.1002/ajp.1350060403","2.0","Caroline E.

The estimation of fresh fruit mass varied greatly with the census method used. Moreover, the fruiting phenology recorded using the fruit-trap collection and raked-ground survey methods showed a delay of one to two months compared with the platform observation method. Any of the three methods can be used for the approximation of annual fruiting phenology, but that of fruit-trap collection is suited to measure the annual fruit production, and that of platform observation offers the best estimation of the quantity of fruit in tree crowns at a given time.","10.1017/s0266467400008750","2.0","Shuyi Zhang; Lixin Wang","1995.0","","","fruit; census; methods; guiana"

"Racial Measurement in the American Census: Past Practices and Implications for the Future","▪ Abstract In 1977, the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) established an official classification standard for the measurement of race in the American population. In so doing, the OMB authorities created what amounted to a racial cosmology that spread throughout American society, affecting public perceptions about the racial hierarchy of American society. In 1997, the OMB issued a revised version of this classification in which small changes may profoundly affect the way policymakers and the American public think about race. At the very least, these revisions present significant challenges to social scientists who study race and ethnicity. This review begins with a brief historical overview of racial data collected by the federal government. It subsequently examines the circumstances leading up to the 1997 revisions of OMB Directive No. 15 and discusses how these revisions may affect social scientific research on the subject of race and ethnicity.","10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100006","1.0","C.

"A census of mitotic cancer genes: new insights into tumor cell biology and cancer therapy","Tumor cell proliferation is frequently associated with genetic or epigenetic alterations in key regulators of the cell cycle. Most known oncogenes and tumor suppressors target entry into the cell cycle and control the G 1 /S transition. However, tumor-associated alterations in spindle formation or chromosome segregation are also frequent and may result in chromosomal instability. In fact, a few centrosomal or mitotic proteins such as aurora A, polo-like kinase 1 and PTTG1 (securin) have been reported to act as oncogenes. Some spindle checkpoint regulators such as the BUB kinases or MAD2 protect cells from aberrant chromosome segregation and may therefore function as suppressors of malignant transformation. However, few cancer-associated mutations in these or other mitotic regulators have been described thus far and many of these molecules do not fit into the classical definition of 'oncogenes' or 'tumor suppressor genes'. In some cases, both over-expression and decreased expression of these genes result in mitotic arrest. Moreover, some mitotic regulators such as MAD2 are either up- or down-regulated depending on the tumor types and, in both cases, these alterations result in chromosomal imbalances and tumor development. Minor changes in protein levels that do not compromise cell viability might therefore be sufficient to dysregulate the mitotic cycle and induce genomic instability.

The resulting data can be put in the form of an incomplete 2k contingency table, with one missing cell, that displays the full multiple recapture history of all individuals in the population. Log linear models are fitted to this incomplete contingency table, and the simplest plausible model that fits the observed cells is projected to cover the miming cell, thus yielding an estimate of the total population size. Asymptotic variances for the estimate of the population size are considered, and the techniques are illustrated on a population of children possessing a common congenital anomaly.","10.1093/biomet/59.3.591","1.0","Stephen E.

"Chronic Ventilator Need in the Community: A 2005 Pediatric Census of Massachusetts","The purpose of this study was to describe the population of children with chronic mechanical ventilation in Massachusetts and their patterns of medical care.Investigators surveyed all of the Massachusetts home ventilator clinics, pediatric pulmonary services, hospital-based pediatric services for special health care needs, insurers, home care vendors, nursing agencies, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, selected individual providers, and rehabilitation and long-term care facilities providing services to children with chronic respiratory support needs. Support was defined as daily use of noninvasive, negative-pressure, or invasive/transtracheal ventilators. Subsequent matching of demographic data, including date of birth, zip code, and gender supported maximal census yield without duplications. Geographic information systems were used to create distribution maps and estimate distances between children with chronic mechanical ventilator needs and key resources.A total of 197 children were identified as requiring chronic mechanical respiratory support in Massachusetts in 2005, which was a nearly threefold increase in this population in the 15-year interval since the last census. Congenital or perinatal-acquired neurologic or neuromuscular disorders constituted the majority of primary diagnoses (n = 107 [54%]). Chronic lung disease attributed to prematurity represented only 7% of the sample.Children receiving chronic mechanical respiratory support are a growing population. The shift in underlying diagnoses from pulmonary disease to neurogenic respiratory insufficiency has implications for hospital and community-based providers from all disciplines in extending services to the home setting. Barriers encountered when performing this study, however, reflect an overall lack of coordination among the many individuals and agencies involved in their care.

"Low cellular IRS 1 gene and protein expression predict insulin resistance and NIDDM","We examined the gene and protein expression of IRS 1 (insulin receptor substrate 1) in adipocytes from two groups of healthy individuals with an increased propensity for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM): those with two first-degree relatives with diabetes and another group with massive obesity. A low expression of IRS 1(<50% of the matched control group) was seen in «30% of both groups and these individuals were characterized by insulin resistance and its hallmarks: higher levels of insulin, glucose, and triglycerides. Two individuals with previously unknown NIDDM were diagnosed and both had low IRS 1 expression. Low IRS 1 protein expression was associated with low mRNA levels but not with the common Gly972Arg polymorphism of the IRS 1 gene. Taken together, our present and previous findings show that a low expression of IRS 1 in fat cells predicts insulin resistance and NIDDM. Furthermore, they support the likelihood that an impaired transcriptional activation may play a key role in the pathogenesis of NIDDM.—Carvalho, E., Jansson, P.-A., Axelsen, M., Eriksson, J.

"Baryon census in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters","We carry out an analysis of a set of cosmological SPH hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters and groups aimed at studying the total baryon budget in clusters, and how this budget is shared between the hot diffuse component and the stellar component. Using the TreePM+SPH GADGET-3 code, we carried out one set of non-radiative simulations, and two sets of simulations including radiative cooling, star formation and feedback from supernovae (SN), one of which also accounting for the effect of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). The analysis is carried out with the twofold aim of studying the implication of stellar and hot gas content on the relative role played by SN and AGN feedback, and to calibrate the cluster baryon fraction and its evolution as a cosmological tool. We find that both radiative simulation sets predict a trend of stellar mass fraction with cluster mass that tends to be weaker than the observed one. However this tension depends on the particular set of observational data considered. Including the effect of AGN feedback alleviates this tension on the stellar mass and predicts values of the hot gas mass fraction and total baryon fraction to be in closer agreement with observational results. We further compute the ratio between the cluster baryon content and the cosmic baryon fraction, Y_b, as a function of cluster-centric radius and redshift. At R_500 we find for massive clusters with M_500>2\times10^{14} h^{-1} M_sun that Y_b is nearly independent of the physical processes included and characterized by a negligible redshift evolution: Y_{b,500}=0.85+/-0.03 with the error accounting for the intrinsic r.m.s. scatter within the set of simulated clusters. At smaller radii, R_2500, the typical value of Y_b slightly decreases, by an amount that depends on the physics included in the simulations, while its scatter increases by about a factor of two.","10.1093/mnras/stt265","7.0","S.

"c2d<i>Spitzer</i>IRS Spectra of Disks around T Tauri Stars. I. Silicate Emission and Grain Growth","Infrared ~5--35 um spectra for 40 solar-mass T Tauri stars and 7 intermediate-mass Herbig Ae stars with circumstellar disks were obtained using the Spitzer Space Telescope as part of the c2d IRS survey. This work complements prior spectroscopic studies of silicate infrared emission from disks, which were focused on intermediate-mass stars, with observations of solar-mass stars limited primarily to the 10 um region. The observed 10 and 20 um silicate feature strengths/shapes are consistent with source-to-source variations in grain size. A large fraction of the features are weak and flat, consistent with um-sized grains indicating fast grain growth (from 0.1--1.0 um in radius). In addition, approximately half of the T Tauri star spectra show crystalline silicate features near 28 and 33 um indicating significant processing when compared to interstellar grains. A few sources show large 10-to-20 um ratios and require even larger grains emitting at 20 um than at 10 um. This size difference may arise from the difference in the depth into the disk probed by the two silicate emission bands in disks where dust settling has occurred. The 10 um feature strength vs. shape trend is not correlated with age or Halpha equivalent width, suggesting that some amount of turbulent mixing and regeneration of small grains is occurring. The strength vs. shape trend is related to spectral type, however, with M stars showing significantly flatter 10 um features (larger grain sizes) than A/B stars. The connection between spectral type and grain size is interpreted in terms of the variation in the silicate emission radius as a function of stellar luminosity, but could also be indicative of other spectral-type dependent factors (e.g, X-rays, UV radiation, stellar/disk winds, etc.).","10.1086/499330","13.0","Jacqueline Kessler‐Silacci; J.‐C.

"Wireless Communication via Double IRS: Channel Estimation and Passive Beamforming Designs","In this letter, we study efficient channel estimation and passive beamforming designs for a double-intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided single-user communication system, where a user communicates with an access point (AP) via the cascaded user-IRS 1-IRS 2-AP double-reflection link. First, a general channel estimation scheme is proposed for the system under any arbitrary inter-IRS channel, where all coefficients of the cascaded channel are estimated. Next, for the typical scenario with a line-of-sight (LoS)-dominant inter-IRS channel, we propose another customized scheme to estimate two signature vectors of the rank-one cascaded channel with significantly less channel training time than the first scheme. For the two proposed channel estimation schemes, we further optimize their corresponding cooperative passive beamforming for data transmission to maximize the achievable rate with the training overhead and channel estimation error taken into account. Numerical results show that deploying two cooperative IRSs with the proposed channel estimation and passive beamforming designs achieves significant rate enhancement as compared to the conventional case of single IRS deployment.","10.1109/lwc.2020.3034388","3.0","Changsheng You; Beixiong Zheng; Rui Zhang","2020.0","","","communication; double; irs; channel; passive; beamforming; designs"
"Towards a complete census of AGN in nearby Galaxies: a large population of optically unidentified AGN","Using Spitzer–infrared spectrograph (IRS) spectroscopy, we investigate the ubiquity of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in a complete (≈94 per cent), volume-limited sample of the most bolometrically luminous galaxies [LIR,8−1000 μm≳ (0.3–20) × 1010 L⊙] to D < 15 Mpc. Our analyses are based on the detection of the high-excitation emission line [Ne v]λ14.32 μm (97.1 eV) to unambiguously identify AGN activity. We find that 17 of the 64 infrared (IR) bright galaxies in our sample host AGN activity (≈27+8−6 per cent), ?50 per cent of which are not identified as AGN using optical spectroscopy. The large AGN fraction indicates a tighter connection between AGN activity and IR luminosity for galaxies in the local Universe than previously found, potentially indicating a close association between AGN activity and star formation. The optically unidentified AGN span a wide range of galaxy type (S0–Ir) and are typically starburst-dominated systems hosting modest-luminosity AGN activity (L[Ne V]≈ 1037–1039 erg s−1). The non-identification of optical AGN signatures in the majority of these galaxies appears to be due to extinction towards the AGN, rather than intrinsically low-luminosity AGN activity; however, we note that the AGN optical signatures are diluted in some galaxies due to strong star formation activity. Examination of optical images shows that the optically unidentified AGN with evidence for extinction are hosted in either highly inclined galaxies or galaxies with dust lanes, indicating that obscuration of the AGN is not necessarily due to an obscuring torus. We therefore conclude that optical spectroscopic surveys miss approximately half of the AGN population simply due to extinction through the host galaxy.","10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15194.x","2.0","Andy D.

"IRS-Aided WPCNs: A New Optimization Framework for Dynamic IRS Beamforming","In this paper, we propose a <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">new dynamic IRS beamforming</i> framework to boost the sum throughput of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided wireless powered communication network (WPCN). Specifically, the IRS phase-shift vectors across time and resource allocation are jointly optimized to enhance the efficiencies of both downlink wireless power transfer (DL WPT) and uplink wireless information transmission (UL WIT) between a hybrid access point (HAP) and multiple wirelessly powered devices. To this end, we first study three special cases of the dynamic IRS beamforming, namely <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">user-adaptive</i> IRS beamforming, <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">UL-adaptive</i> IRS beamforming, and <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">static IRS beamforming</i> , by characterizing their optimal performance relationships and proposing corresponding algorithms. Interestingly, it is rigorously proved that the latter two cases achieve the same throughput, thus helping halve the number of IRS phase shifts to be optimized and signalling overhead practically required for UL-adaptive IRS beamforming. Then, we propose a general optimization framework for dynamic IRS beamforming, which is applicable for any given number of IRS phase-shift vectors available. Despite of the non-convexity of the general problem with highly coupled optimization variables, we propose two algorithms to solve it and particularly, the low-complexity algorithm exploits the intrinsic structure of the optimal solution as well as the solutions to the cases with user-adaptive and static IRS beamforming. Simulation results validate our theoretical findings, illustrate the practical significance of IRS with dynamic beamforming for spectral and energy efficient WPCNs, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs over various benchmark schemes.","10.1109/twc.2021.3132666","5.0","Qingqing Wu; Xiaobo Zhou; Wen Chen; Jun Li; Xiu Yin Zhang","2021.0","","","irs; aided; wpcns; a; new; optimization; dynamic; beamforming"

The isomerization activity of the latter can be enhanced by creating an extended silanol nest in its vicinity. Besides the increased Lewis acidity and coordination flexibility of the Sn center, the enhanced reactivity in this case is ascribed to the reaction environment that promotes activation of the confined sugar intermediates through hydrogen bonding.

"A Three-Sample Multiple-Recapture Approach to Census Population Estimation with Heterogeneous Catchability","""A central assumption in the standard capture-recapture approach to the estimation of the size of a closed population is the homogeneity of the 'capture' probabilities. In this article we develop an approach that allows for varying susceptibility to capture through individual parameters using a variant of the Rasch model from psychological measurement situations. Our approach requires an additional recapture. In the context of census undercount estimation, this requirement amounts to the use of a second independent sample or alternative data source to be matched with census and Post-Enumeration Survey (PES) data.... We illustrate [our] models and their estimation using data from a 1988 dress-rehearsal study for the 1990 census conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, which explored the use of administrative data as a supplement to the PES.

"Robust and Secure Sum-Rate Maximization for Multiuser MISO Downlink Systems With Self-Sustainable IRS","This paper investigates robust and secure multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink communications assisted by a self-sustainable intelligent reflection surface (IRS), which can simultaneously reflect and harvest energy from the received signals. We study the joint design of beamformers at an access point (AP) and the phase shifts as well as the energy harvesting schedule at the IRS for maximizing the system sum-rate. The design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem taking into account the wireless energy harvesting capability of IRS elements, secure communications, and the robustness against the impact of channel state information (CSI) imperfection. Subsequently, we propose a computationally-efficient iterative algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution to the design problem. In each iteration, <inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mathcal {S}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> -procedure and the successive convex approximation are adopted to handle the intermediate optimization problem. Our simulation results unveil that: 1) there is a non-trivial trade-off between the system sum-rate and the self-sustainability of the IRS; 2) the performance gain achieved by the proposed scheme is saturated with a large number of energy harvesting IRS elements; 3) an IRS equipped with small bit-resolution discrete phase shifters is sufficient to achieve a considerable system sum-rate of the ideal case with continuous phase shifts.","10.1109/tcomm.2021.3097140","6.0","Shaokang Hu; Zhiqiang Wei; Yuanxin Cai; Chang Liu; Derrick Wing Kwan Ng; Jinhong Yuan","2021.0","","","robust; secure; sum; rate; maximization; multiuser; miso; downlink; systems; self; sustainable; irs"
"Censusing and Measuring Lianas: A Quantitative Comparison of the Common Methods<sup>1</sup>","ABSTRACT Lianas contribute to many aspects of tropical forest diversity and dynamics, and interest in liana ecology has grown substantially in recent years. Methods to census lianas and estimate biomass, however, differ among studies, possibly hindering attempts to compare liana communities. At Nouragues Research Station (French Guiana), we tested the extent to which liana abundance, basal area, and estimated biomass differed depending on stem diameter measurement location, inclusion of ramets, inclusion of lianas rooted within versus passing through the plot, and plot shape. We found that the mean per plot abundance and basal area of lianas were significantly greater when lianas were measured low on the stem, when ramets were included, and when lianas were sampled in transects (2 × 50 m) than in square plots (10 × 10 m). Mean per plot liana abundance and basal area were 21 percent and 58 percent greater, when stems were measured at the largest spot on the stem compared to 130 cm from the ground, respectively. Including liana ramets increased average per plot liana abundance, basal area, and estimated biomass by 19, 17, and 16 percent, respectively. To facilitate cross‐study comparisons, we developed conversion equations that equate liana abundance, diameter, and basal area based on the measurements taken at four different stem locations. We tested these equations at Lambir Hills National Park, Malaysia and found that they did not differ significantly between the two sites, suggesting that the equations may be broadly applicable. Finally, we present a new allometric equation relating diameter and biomass developed from 424 lianas from five independent data sets collected in four countries.","10.1111/j.1744-7429.2006.00187.x","3.0","Stefan A.

"Census of gorillas in northern Republic of Congo","We censused gorilla populations in northern Congo from February to April 1989 and June 1990. The objective was to provide the first quantitative data from a variety of sites on gorilla populations from a country that had unknown but potentially high populations. The method used was a census of nests along strip transects. A total of 401.0 km of transects was sampled in four different study areas. The overall density calculated for all transects was 0.4 nesting gorillas/km2. The highest density, 1.2 nesting gorillas/km2, was found in the vast Likouala swamp area of north central Congo. The two northern sites showed low densities of 0.1 and 0.2 nesting gorillas/km2, respectively. The northwestern site showed an intermediate density of 0.6 nesting gorillas/km2. The vegetation type with the highest density was swamp forest with 2.4 nesting gorillas/km2. The limited sample presented shows that gorillas are widespread and common in northern Congo, even in the swamp forests previously considered unsuitable as gorilla habitat. It is probable that Congo holds the largest population of gorillas in Africa after Gabon. © 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","10.1002/ajp.1350270405","2.0","J.

"A NEW CLASS OF LUMINOUS TRANSIENTS AND A FIRST CENSUS OF THEIR MASSIVE STELLAR PROGENITORS","The progenitors of SN 2008S and the 2008 transient in NGC300 were dust-enshrouded, with extremely red mid-infrared (MIR) colors and relatively low luminosities. The transients were optically faint (-13 &lt; M_V &lt; -15) compared to normal core-collapse supernovae (SNe), and their spectra exhibited narrow emission lines. These events are unique among transient-progenitor pairs and hence constitute a new class. Whether they are true SNe or bright massive-star eruptions, we argue that their rate is ~20% of the SN rate. This fact is remarkable in light of the observation that a very small fraction of all massive stars have the MIR colors of the SN 2008S and NGC300 progenitors, as we show using MIR and optical luminosity, color, and variability properties of massive stars in M33. We find that the fraction of massive stars with colors consistent with these progenitors is 1/10000. In fact, only &lt; 10 similar objects exist in M33 - all of which lie at the luminous red extremum of the AGB sequence. That these transients are relatively common with respect to SNe, while their progenitors are rare compared to the massive star population, implies that the dust-enshrouded phase is a short-lived phase in the lives of many massive stars. This shrouded epoch can occur only in the last ~10^4 yr before explosion, be it death or merely eruption. We discuss the implications of this finding for the evolution and census of ``low-mass'' massive stars (8-12 Msun), and we connect it with theoretical discussions of electron-capture SNe and the explosive birth of white dwarfs. A systematic census with (warm) Spitzer of galaxies in the local universe for analogous progenitors would significantly improve our knowledge of this channel to massive stellar explosions, and potentially to others with obscured progenitors.

"IRS and TOR nutrient-signaling pathways act <i>via</i> juvenile hormone to influence honey bee caste fate","Regardless of genetic makeup, a female honey bee becomes a queen or worker depending on the food she receives as a larva. For decades, it has been known that nutrition and juvenile hormone (JH) signaling determine the caste fate of the individual bee. However, it is still largely unclear how these factors are connected. To address this question, we suppressed nutrient sensing by RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene knockdown of IRS (insulin receptor substrate) and TOR (target of rapamycin) in larvae reared on queen diet. The treatments affected several layers of organismal organization that could play a role in the response to differential nutrition between castes. These include transcript profiles, proteomic patterns, lipid levels, DNA methylation response and morphological features. Most importantly, gene knockdown abolished a JH peak that signals queen development and resulted in a worker phenotype. Application of JH rescued the queen phenotype in either knockdown, which demonstrates that the larval response to JH remains intact and can drive normal developmental plasticity even when IRS or TOR transcript levels are reduced. We discuss our results in the context of other recent findings on honey bee caste and development and propose that IRS is an alternative substrate for the Egfr (epidermal growth factor receptor) in honey bees.

"Exploiting Benefits of IRS in Wireless Powered NOMA Networks","We consider an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) wireless-powered NOMA Internet-of-Things (IoT) network, where multiple NOMA IoT devices can communicate with access point (AP) with the aid of IRS. Specifically, IoT devices can harvest energy from a nearby appropriative power station (PS) during the wireless energy transfer (WET) phase through the direct links as well as the reflecting links from IRS. Then, the harvested energy can achieve the wireless information transfer (WIT) during the uplink between IoT devices and AP by adopting NOMA protocol. A novel resource allocation scheme is proposed to maximized the sum throughput of the considered system by jointly optimizing the time allocation factor and phase shift matrices of WET and WIT. The optimization problem is non-convex due to multiple variables. We first transfer this problem into convex function by assuming one of the phase shift matrices fixed, and solve the transferred problem by obtaining closed-form solution. Then, the elements collaborative approximate (ECA) and the manifold space gradient descent (MSGD) algorithms are designed to optimize the phase shift matrix. ECA is iteratively optimizing one element and MSGD is focus on the derivation of a gradient descent over the manifold space. Numerical results indicate the sum throughput enhancement by IRS compared with no IRS, and highlight the advantages of IRS.","10.1109/tgcn.2022.3144744","6.0","Xingwang Li; Zhen Xie; Zheng Chu; Varun G.

"Arabidopsis Genes Involved in Acyl Lipid Metabolism. A 2003 Census of the Candidates, a Study of the Distribution of Expressed Sequence Tags in Organs, and a Web-Based Database","Abstract The genome of Arabidopsis has been searched for sequences of genes involved in acyl lipid metabolism. Over 600 encoded proteins have been identified, cataloged, and classified according to predicted function, subcellular location, and alternative splicing. At least one-third of these proteins were previously annotated as “unknown function” or with functions unrelated to acyl lipid metabolism; therefore, this study has improved the annotation of over 200 genes. In particular, annotation of the lipolytic enzyme group (at least 110 members total) has been improved by the critical examination of the biochemical literature and the sequences of the numerous proteins annotated as “lipases.” In addition, expressed sequence tag (EST) data have been surveyed, and more than 3,700 ESTs associated with the genes were cataloged. Statistical analysis of the number of ESTs associated with specific cDNA libraries has allowed calculation of probabilities of differential expression between different organs. More than 130 genes have been identified with a statistical probability &amp;gt; 0.95 of preferential expression in seed, leaf, root, or flower. All the data are available as a Web-based database, the Arabidopsis Lipid Gene database (http://www.plantbiology.msu.edu/lipids/genesurvey/index.htm). The combination of the data of the Lipid Gene Catalog and the EST analysis can be used to gain insights into differential expression of gene family members and sets of pathway-specific genes, which in turn will guide studies to understand specific functions of individual genes.","10.1104/pp.103.022988","13.0","Fred Beisson; Abraham J.

"The Soviet Union as a Work-in-Progress: Ethnographers and the Category Nationality in the 1926, 1937, and 1939 Censuses","The All-Union Congress of Soviets ratified the Constitution of the USSR on 31 January 1924 and, according to traditional narratives, brought the formation of the Soviet Union to a close. The very same day, a group of leading ethnographers met at the Academy of Sciences in Petrograd to discuss a directive they had received from the Soviet of Nationalities: define nationality, determine “rational criteria” for classifying the population in the first All-Union Census, and notify the Central Statistical Administration as soon as possible. The legal formation of the Soviet Union had been completed, but the state-building process, which involved “re-imagining” the former Russian empire as a socialist federation of nationalities, was just getting under way. This essay argues that the classification of Soviet citizens by nationality in the All-Union Censuses of 1926, 1937, and 1939 was a fundamental component of the creation of the multinational state. The very establishment of the census category nationality marked a critical break with the tsarist regime, which had categorized its subjects on the basis of religion and native language. Ethnographers, statisticians, and linguists from Minsk to Vladivostok who formulated questionnaires and drew up lists of nationalities for all three censuses used their expertise to divine order out of chaos and create a new definitional grid. Not only did they have to decide which tribes, clans, and peoples belonged to which nationality, they also had to figure out what “nationality” meant.","10.2307/2500785","1.0","Francine Hirsch","1997.0","","","soviet; union; progress; ethnographers; category; nationality; censuses"
"Measurement of Higher Education in the Census and Current Population Survey","We examine measurement error in the reporting of higher education in the 1990 Decennial Census and the post-1991 Current Population Survey (CPS). We document that measurement error in the reporting of higher education is prevalent in Census data. Further, these errors violate models of classical measurement error in important ways. The level of education is consistently reported as higher than it is (errors are not mean 0), errors in the reporting of education are correlated with covariates that appear in earnings regressions, and errors in the reporting of education appear correlated with the error term in a model of earnings determination. Thus, neither well-known results on classical measurement error nor recent models of nonclassical measurement error are likely valid when using Census and CPS data. We find some evidence that the measurement error is lower in the CPS than in the Census, presumably because first interviews are generally conducted in person.","10.1198/016214503000000369","3.0","Dan A.

"A census of the Wolf-Rayet content in Westerlund 1 from near-infrared imaging and spectroscopy","New NTT/SOFI imaging and spectroscopy of the Wolf-Rayet population in Westerlund 1 are presented. Narrow-band near-IR imaging together with follow up spectroscopy reveals four new WR stars, of which three were independently identified recently by Groh et al., bringing the confirmed WR content to 24 (23 excluding source S) [..] A quantitative near-IR spectral classification scheme for WR stars is presented and applied to members of Westerlund 1. Late subtypes are dominant, with no subtypes earlier than WN5 or WC8 for the nitrogen and carbon sequences, respectively. A qualitative inspection of the WN stars suggests that most (75%) are highly H-deficient. The WR binary fraction is high (&gt;62%), on the basis of dust emission from WC stars, in addition to a significant WN binary fraction from hard X-ray detections according to Clark et al. We exploit the large WN population of Westerlund 1 to reassess its distance (~5.0kpc) and extinction (A_Ks ~ 0.96 mag), such that it is located at the edge of the Galactic bar, [..]. The observed ratio of WR stars to red and yellow hypergiants, N(WR)/N(RSG+YHG)~3, favours an age of 4.5-5.0 Myr, with individual WR stars descended from progenitors of initial mass ~ 40-55 Msun. Qualitative estimates of current masses for non-dusty, H-free WR stars are presented, revealing 10-18 Msun, such that ~75% of the initial stellar mass has been removed via stellar winds or close binary evolution. We present a revision to the cluster turn-off mass for other Milky Way clusters in which WR stars are known, based upon the latest temperature calibration for OB stars. Finally, comparisons between the observed WR population and subtype distribution in Westerlund 1 and instantaneous burst evolutionary synthesis models are presented.","10.1111/j.1365-2966.2006.10952.x","5.0","P.

"A census of the lung: CellCards from LungMAP","The human lung plays vital roles in respiration, host defense, and basic physiology. Recent technological advancements such as single-cell RNA sequencing and genetic lineage tracing have revealed novel cell types and enriched functional properties of existing cell types in lung. The time has come to take a new census. Initiated by members of the NHLBI-funded LungMAP Consortium and aided by experts in the lung biology community, we synthesized current data into a comprehensive and practical cellular census of the lung. Identities of cell types in the normal lung are captured in individual cell cards with delineation of function, markers, developmental lineages, heterogeneity, regenerative potential, disease links, and key experimental tools. This publication will serve as the starting point of a live, up-to-date guide for lung research at https://www.lungmap.net/cell-cards/.

As part of a larger research effort by the U.S. Census Bureau to improve race and Hispanic origin questions for the 2020 Census, we tested experimental versions of race and Hispanic origin questions in Spanish. About half of the versions asked about race and Hispanic origin in separate questions, while the rest asked about these constructs in a combined question format. Cognitive interviews with 33 monolingual Spanish-speaking participants indicated that (a) most participants affirmatively claimed Hispanic origin on the separate and combined formats, but had difficulty selecting or declined to select a race category on the separate question formats and (b) most participants perceived few differences between Hispanic origin and race. In comparison with the separate race and Hispanic origin questions, the combined question facilitated more satisfactory self-identifications.","10.1177/0739986313499007","2.0","Rodney L.

"Ambient PM <sub>2.5</sub> , O <sub>3</sub> , and NO <sub>2</sub> Exposures and Associations with Mortality over 16 Years of Follow-Up in the Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC)","BackgroundFew studies examining the associations between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and mortality have considered multiple pollutants when assessing changes in exposure due to residential mobility during follow-up.ObjectiveWe investigated associations between cause-specific mortality and ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (≤ 2.5 μm; PM2.5), ozone (O3), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in a national cohort of about 2.5 million Canadians.MethodsWe assigned estimates of annual concentrations of these pollutants to the residential postal codes of subjects for each year during 16 years of follow-up. Historical tax data allowed us to track subjects’ residential postal code annually. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for each pollutant separately and adjusted for the other pollutants. We also estimated the product of the three HRs as a measure of the cumulative association with mortality for several causes of death for an increment of the mean minus the 5th percentile of each pollutant: 5.0 μg/m3 for PM2.5, 9.5 ppb for O3, and 8.1 ppb for NO2.ResultsPM2.5, O3, and NO2 were associated with nonaccidental and cause-specific mortality in single-pollutant models. Exposure to PM2.5 alone was not sufficient to fully characterize the toxicity of the atmospheric mix or to fully explain the risk of mortality associated with exposure to ambient pollution. Assuming additive associations, the estimated HR for nonaccidental mortality corresponding to a change in exposure from the mean to the 5th percentile for all three pollutants together was 1.075 (95% CI: 1.067, 1.084). Accounting for residential mobility had only a limited impact on the association between mortality and PM2.5 and O3, but increased associations with NO2.ConclusionsIn this large, national-level cohort, we found positive associations between several common causes of death and exposure to PM2.5, O3, and NO2.CitationCrouse DL, Peters PA, Hystad P, Brook JR, van Donkelaar A, Martin RV, Villeneuve PJ, Jerrett M, Goldberg MS, Pope CA III, Brauer M, Brook RD, Robichaud A, Menard R, Burnett RT. 2015.

"Changes in educational inequality in China, 1990–2005: Evidence from the population census data","This chapter examines the trend in school enrollment and transitions to senior high school and to college in China for selected young cohorts since the 1990s, based on the analyses of the sample data from population censuses in 1990 and 2000 and the mini-census in 2005. We pay particular attention to educational inequality based on gender and the household registration system (hukou) in the context of educational expansion. Results show a substantial increase in educational opportunities over time at all levels. In particular, women have gained relatively more; gender inequality has decreased over time, and the gap in college enrollments was even reversed to favor women in 2005. However, rural–urban inequality was enlarged in the 1990s. The educational expansion has mainly benefited females and urban residents.","10.1108/s1479-3539(2010)0000017007","2.0","Xiaogang Wu; Zhuoni Zhang","2010.0","","","changes; inequality; china; evidence; population; census"

"History counts: a comparative analysis of racial/color categorization in US and Brazilian censuses","Categories of race (ethnicity, color, or both) have appeared and continue to appear in the demographic censuses of numerous countries, including the United States and Brazil. Until recently, such categorization had largely escaped critical scrutiny, being viewed and treated as a technical procedure requiring little conceptual clarity or historical explanation. Recent political developments and methodological changes, in US censuses especially, have engendered a critical reexamination of both the comparative and the historical dimensions of categorization. The author presents a comparative analysis of the histories of racial/color categorization in American and Brazilian censuses and shows that racial (and color) categories have appeared in these censuses because of shifting ideas about race and the enduring power of these ideas as organizers of political, economic, and social life in both countries. These categories have not appeared simply as demographic markers. The author demonstrates that censuses are instruments at a state's disposal and are not simply detached registers of population and performance.","10.2105/ajph.90.11.1738","1.0","Melissa Nobles","2000.0","","","history; color; categorization; us; censuses"
"Characterizing occupational heat‐related mortality in the United States, 2000–2010: An analysis using the census of fatal occupational injuries database","Background Occupational heat‐related mortality is not well studied and risk factors remain largely unknown. This paper describes the epidemiological characteristics of heat‐related deaths among workers in the US 2000–2010. Methods Fatality data were obtained at the Bureau of Labor Statistics from the confidential on‐site Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries database. Fatality rates and risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated by year, sex, age group, ethnicity, race, state, and industry. Results Between 2000 and 2010, 359 occupational heat‐related deaths were identified in the U.S., for a yearly average fatality rate of 0.22 per 1 million workers. Highest rates were found among Hispanics, men, the agriculture and construction industries, the state of Mississippi, and very small establishments. Conclusions This study provides the first comprehensive national profile of heat‐related deaths in the U.S. workplace. Prevention efforts should be directed at small businesses and at industries and individuals with the highest risk. Am. J. Ind.

"Preconditioned Krylov solvers for BEA","Abstract The performance of a number of preconditioned Krylov methods is analysed for a large variety of boundary element formulations. Low‐ and high‐order element, two‐dimensional (2‐D) and three‐dimensional 3‐D, regular, singular and hypersingular, collocation and symmetric Galerkin, single‐ and multi‐zone, thermal and elastic, continuous and discontinuous boundary formulations with and without condensation are considered. Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (CG) solvers in standard form and a form effectively operating on the normal equations (CGN), Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES), Conjugate Gradient Squared (CGS) and Stabilized Bi‐conjugate Gradient (Bi‐CGSTAB) Krylov solvers are employed in this study. Both the primitive and preconditioned matrix operators are depicted graphically to illustrate the relative amenability of the alternative formulations to solution via Kryiov methods, and to contrast and explain their computational performances. A notable difference between 2‐D and 3‐D BEA operators is readily visualized in this manner. Numerical examples are presented and the relative conditioning of the various discrete BEA operators is reflected in the performance of the Krylov equation solvers. A preconditioning scheme which was found to be uncompetitive in the collocation BEA context is shown to make iterative solution of symmetric Galerkin BEA problems more economical than employing direct solution techniques. We conclude that the preconditioned Krylov techniques are competitive with or superior to direct methods in a wide range of boundary formulated problems, and that their performance can be partially correlated with certain problem characteristics.","10.1002/nme.1620371003","4.0","K.

"Fast Channel Estimation for IRS-Assisted OFDM","In this letter, we study efficient channel estimation for an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system to achieve minimum training time. First, a fast channel estimation scheme with reduced OFDM symbol duration is proposed for arbitrary frequency-selective fading channels. Next, under the typical condition that the IRS-user channel is line-of-sight (LoS) dominant, another fast channel estimation scheme based on the novel concept of sampling-wise IRS reflection variation is proposed. Moreover, the pilot signal and IRS training reflection pattern are jointly optimized for both proposed schemes. Finally, the proposed schemes are compared in terms of training time and channel estimation performance via simulations, as well as against benchmark schemes.","10.1109/lwc.2020.3038434","3.0","Beixiong Zheng; Changsheng You; Rui Zhang","2020.0","","","fast; channel; irs; assisted; ofdm"

"Joint Beamforming Design and Power Splitting Optimization in IRS-Assisted SWIPT NOMA Networks","This paper proposes a novel network framework of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks, where IRS is used to enhance the NOMA performance and the wireless power transfer (WPT) efficiency of SWIPT. We formulate a problem of minimizing base station (BS) transmit power by jointly optimizing successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding order, BS transmit beamforming vector, power splitting (PS) ratio and IRS phase shift while taking into account the quality-of-service (QoS) requirement and energy harvested threshold of each user. The formulated problem is non-convex optimization problem, which is difficult to solve it directly. Hence, a two-stage algorithm is proposed to solve the above-mentioned problem by applying semidefinite relaxation (SDR), Gaussian randomization and successive convex approximation (SCA). Specifically, after determining SIC decoding order by designing IRS phase shift in the first stage, we alternately optimize BS transmit beamforming vector, PS ratio, and IRS phase shift to minimize the BS transmit power. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed optimization algorithm in reducing BS transmit power compared to other baseline algorithms. Meanwhile, compared with non-IRS-assisted network, the IRS-assisted SWIPT NOMA network can decrease BS transmit power by 51.13%.","10.1109/twc.2021.3108901","5.0","Zhendong Li; Wen Chen; Qingqing Wu; Kunlun Wang; Jun Li","2021.0","","","beamforming; power; splitting; optimization; irs; assisted; swipt; noma; networks"
"A Census of Actively Licensed Physicians in the United States, 2016","An accurate understanding of the demographic and state medical licensure characteristics of physicians in the United States is critical for health care workforce planning. Overall changes in the nation's population demographics, state and federal medical regulatory policies and dynamics surrounding the ongoing health care reform debate further highlight the need to have an up-to-date census of actively licensed physicians across all medical specialties. This article uses data received by the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) from the nation's state medical and osteopathic licensing boards to report and summarize key features of actively licensed physicians in the United States and the District of Columbia. Our biennial census, current through the end of 2016, identifies a total of 953,695 actively licensed allopathic and osteopathic physicians serving a national population of 323 million people. This represents a net physician-increase of 12% from the 2010 census. From 2010 to 2016, the actively licensed U.S. physician-to-population ratio increased from 277 physicians per 100,000-population to 295 physicians per 100,000-population. Females now make up one-third of all licensed physicians, with osteopathic physicians and Caribbean medical graduates continuing to demonstrate substantial increases in both their absolute numbers and as a percentage of all actively licensed physicians from the 2010 to 2016 time period.","10.30770/2572-1852-103.2.7","6.0","Aaron Young; Humayun J.

"A structural census of genomes: comparing bacterial, eukaryotic, and archaeal genomes in terms of protein structure","Representative genomes from each of the three kingdoms of life are compared in terms of protein structure, in particular, those of Haemophilus influenzae (a bacteria), Methanococcus jannaschii (an archaeon), and yeast (a eukaryote). The comparison is in the form of a census (or comprehensive accounting) of the relative occurrence of secondary and tertiary structures in the genomes, which particular emphasis on patterns of supersecondary structure. Comparison of secondary structure shows that the three genomes have nearly the same overall secondary-structure content, although they differ markedly in amino acid composition. Comparison of super-secondary structure, using a novel ""frequent-words"" approach, shows that yeast has a preponderance of consecutive strands (e.g. beta-beta-beta patterns), Haemophilus, consecutive helices (alpha-alpha-alpha), and Methanococcus, alternating helix-strand structures (beta-alpha-beta). Yeast also has significantly more helical membrane proteins than the other two genomes, with most of the differences concentrated in proteins containing two transmembrane segments. Comparison of tertiary structure (by sequence matching and domain-level clustering) highlights the substantial duplication in each genome (≈30% to 50%), with the degree of duplication following similar patterns in all three. Many sequence families are shared among the genomes, with the degree of overlap between any two genomes being roughly similar. In total, the three genomes contain 148 of the ≈300 known protein folds. Forty-five of these 148 that are present in all three genomes are especially enriched in mixed super-secondary structures (alpha/beta). Moreover, the five most common of these 45 (the ""top-5"") have a remarkably similar super-secondary structure architecture, containing a central sheet of parallel strands with helices packed onto at least one face and beta-alpha-beta connections between adjacent strands. These most basic molecular parts, which, presumably, were present in the last common ancestor to the three kingdoms, include the TIM-barrel, Rossmann, flavodoxin, thiamin-binding, and P-loop-hydrolase folds.","10.1006/jmbi.1997.1412","1.0","Mark Gerstein","1997.0","","","census; genomes; terms; protein"

The Fe abundance for IRS 7 was found to be close to solar, [Fe/H] = -0.02 ± 0.13, and nearly identical to the Fe abundance we obtained for the nearby M supergiants α Ori and VV Cep. Analysis of the first and second overtone lines of CO was used to derive an effective temperature of 3600 ± 230 K, a microturbulent velocity of 3.0 ± 0.3 km s-1, and a carbon abundance log ε (C) = 7.78 ± 0.13, or [C/H] = -0.77. In addition, we find a high depletion of 0.74 ± 0.32 dex in O and an enhancement of 0.92 ± 0.18 dex in N. These abundances are consistent with the dredge-up of CNO cycle products but require deep mixing in excess of that predicted by standard models for red supergiants. In light of our measured solar Fe abundance for IRS 7, we discuss other indicators of metallicity at the Galactic center, the interpretation of low-resolution near-infrared spectra of late-type giants and supergiants, including the need for caution in using such spectra as measures of metallicity, and the evolution of massive young stars at the Galactic center. We suggest the possibility that rapid stellar rotation is common for stars formed under conditions in the Galactic center, and that extra internal mixing induced by high rotation rates, rather than evolution at high metallicity, is the explanation for many of the unusual properties of the hot emission-line stars in the Galactic center.","10.1086/308340","3.0","J.

"Pleiotropic Insulin Signals are Engaged by Multisite Phosphorylation of IRS-1","IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate 1) is a principal insulin receptor substrate that undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation during insulin stimulation. It contains over 20 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, and we suspect that multiple insulin signals are enabled when the activated insulin receptor kinase phosphorylates several of them. Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 binds specifically to various cellular proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains (SH2 proteins). We identified some of the tyrosine residues of IRS-1 that undergo insulin-stimulated phosphorylation by the purified insulin receptor and in intact cells during insulin stimulation. Automated sequencing and manual radiosequencing revealed the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues 460, 608, 628, 895, 939, 987, 1172, and 1222; additional sites remain to be identified. Immobilized SH2 domains from the 85-kDa regulatory subunit (p85 alpha) of the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase bind preferentially to tryptic phosphopeptides containing Tyr(P)-608 and Tyr(P)-939. By contrast, the SH2 domain in GRB2 and the amino-terminal SH2 domain in SHPTP2 (Syp) specifically bind to Tyr(P)-895 and Tyr(P)-1172, respectively. These results confirm the p85 alpha recognizes YMXM motifs and suggest that GRB2 prefers a phosphorylated YVNI motif, whereas SHPTP2 (Syp) binds to a phosphorylated YIDL motif. These results extend the notion that IRS-1 is a multisite docking protein that engages various downstream regulatory elements during insulin signal transmission.","10.1128/mcb.13.12.7418-7428.1993","5.0","Xiao‐Jian Sun; Dan L.

"IRS‐1 Regulation in Health and Disease","Abstract The global incidence of diabetes is increasing at epidemic rates. Estimates suggest there are currently 150 million people with diabetes and this number is expected to double in the next 20 years. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 95% of all cases and is characterized in part by impaired sensitivity to insulin or 'insulin resistance'. Defects in the insulin signalling pathways underpin this resistance. In the current article we discuss the regulation of Insulin Receptor Substrate‐1 (IRS‐1), a protein that plays a pivotal role in insulin signalling and whose function is impaired in subjects with insulin resistance. Coordination of IRS‐1 function is multi‐faceted, involving phosphorylation of IRS‐1 at multiple serine/threonine residues. This controls many aspects of IRS‐1, including its interaction with the insulin receptor and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation, as well as its subcellular distribution and targeting for degradation by the proteasome. Such tight control ensures appropriate transduction and attenuation of the insulin signal, thereby regulating insulin action in healthy individuals. Emerging evidence indicates that 'diabetogenic factors' associated with insulin resistance, such as TNF αand elevated circulating fatty acids, impact on insulin signalling at the level of IRS‐1 serine/threonine phosphorylation. The expression and/or activity of several kinases, such as I κB kinase β(IKK β) and salt‐induced kinase 2 (SIK2), and the phosphorylation of IRS‐1 at key sites, such as Ser307 and Ser789, are increased in states of insulin resistance. Identifying the pathways by which such factors activate these and other kinases, and defining the precise roles of specific serine/threonine phosphorylation events in IRS‐1 regulation, represent important goals which may eventually provide a rationale for therapeutic intervention.

"Censusing and Measuring Lianas: A Quantitative Comparison of the Common Methods<sup>1</sup>","ABSTRACT Lianas contribute to many aspects of tropical forest diversity and dynamics, and interest in liana ecology has grown substantially in recent years. Methods to census lianas and estimate biomass, however, differ among studies, possibly hindering attempts to compare liana communities. At Nouragues Research Station (French Guiana), we tested the extent to which liana abundance, basal area, and estimated biomass differed depending on stem diameter measurement location, inclusion of ramets, inclusion of lianas rooted within versus passing through the plot, and plot shape. We found that the mean per plot abundance and basal area of lianas were significantly greater when lianas were measured low on the stem, when ramets were included, and when lianas were sampled in transects (2 × 50 m) than in square plots (10 × 10 m). Mean per plot liana abundance and basal area were 21 percent and 58 percent greater, when stems were measured at the largest spot on the stem compared to 130 cm from the ground, respectively. Including liana ramets increased average per plot liana abundance, basal area, and estimated biomass by 19, 17, and 16 percent, respectively. To facilitate cross‐study comparisons, we developed conversion equations that equate liana abundance, diameter, and basal area based on the measurements taken at four different stem locations. We tested these equations at Lambir Hills National Park, Malaysia and found that they did not differ significantly between the two sites, suggesting that the equations may be broadly applicable. Finally, we present a new allometric equation relating diameter and biomass developed from 424 lianas from five independent data sets collected in four countries.","10.1111/j.1744-7429.2006.00187.x","3.0","Stefan A.

"The Spectral Energy Distribution of HH 30 IRS: Constraining the Circumstellar Dust Size Distribution","We present spectral energy distribution (SED) models for the edge-on classical T Tauri star HH 30 IRS that indicate that dust grains have grown to larger than 50 μm within its circumstellar disk. The disk geometry and inclination are known from previous modeling of multiwavelength Hubble Space Telescope images, and we use the SED (0.5 μm ≤ λ ≤ 3 mm) to constrain the dust size distribution. Model spectra are shown for different circumstellar dust models: a standard interstellar medium (ISM) mixture and larger grain models. As compared to ISM grains, the larger dust grain models have a shallower wavelength-dependent opacity: smaller at short wavelengths and larger at long wavelengths. Models with the larger dust grains provide a good match to the observed SED of HH 30 IRS. Although the currently available SED is poorly sampled, we estimate L* ≈ 0.2 L☉, Mdisk ≈ 1.5 × 10-3 M☉, and a power law with exponential cutoff dust grain size distribution. This model provides a good fit to the currently available data, but mid- and far-IR observations are required to more tightly constrain the size distribution. The accretion luminosity in our models is Lacc ≲ 0.2L*, corresponding to an accretion rate ≲ 4 × 10-9 M☉ yr-1. Dust size distributions that are simple power-law extensions (i.e., no exponential cutoff) yield acceptable fits to the optical/near-IR but too much emission at millimeter wavelengths, and require larger disk masses up to Mdisk ~ 0.5 M☉. Such a simple size distribution would not be expected in an environment such as the disk of HH 30 IRS (i.e., where coagulation and accretion processes are occurring in addition to grain shattering), particularly over such a large range in grain sizes. Its ability to adequately characterize the grain populations, however, may be determined from more complete observational sampling of the SED in the mid- to far-IR.","10.1086/324285","4.0","Kenneth Wood; M.

"High Resolution Population Maps for Low Income Nations: Combining Land Cover and Census in East Africa","Between 2005 and 2050, the human population is forecast to grow by 2.7 billion, with the vast majority of this growth occurring in low income countries. This growth is likely to have significant social, economic and environmental impacts, and make the achievement of international development goals more difficult. The measurement, monitoring and potential mitigation of these impacts require high resolution, contemporary data on human population distributions. In low income countries, however, where the changes will be concentrated, the least information on the distribution of population exists. In this paper we investigate whether satellite imagery in combination with land cover information and census data can be used to create inexpensive, high resolution and easily-updatable settlement and population distribution maps over large areas.We examine various approaches for the production of maps of the East African region (Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda and Tanzania) and where fine resolution census data exists, test the accuracies of map production approaches and existing population distribution products. The results show that combining high resolution census, settlement and land cover information is important in producing accurate population distribution maps.We find that this semi-automated population distribution mapping at unprecedented spatial resolution produces more accurate results than existing products and can be undertaken for as little as $0.01 per km(2). The resulting population maps are a product of the Malaria Atlas Project (MAP: http://www.map.ox.ac.uk) and are freely available.","10.1371/journal.pone.0001298","5.0","Andrew J. Tatem; Abdisalan M.

"The Herschel census of infrared SEDs through cosmic time★","Using Herschel data from the deepest SPIRE and PACS surveys (HerMES and PEP) in COSMOS and GOODS (N+S), we examine the dust properties of IR-luminous (L_IR>10^10 L_sun) galaxies at 0.1<z<2 and determine how these evolve with cosmic time. The unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of survey selection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated, IR-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selection biases. We find that IR-luminous galaxies have SEDs with broad far-IR peaks characterised by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures in the 25-45K range. Hot (T>45K) SEDs and cold (T<25K), cirrus-dominated SEDs are rare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts such as M82 and cool spirals such as M51. We observe a luminosity-temperature (L-T) relation, where the average dust temperature of log[L_IR/L_sun]=12.5 galaxies is about 10K higher than that of their log[L_IR/L_sun]=10.5 counterparts. However, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is the driving factor behind the L-T relation, the increase in dust mass and/or starburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. Our results show that the dust conditions in IR-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time: at high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10K lower than what is measured locally. This is manifested as a flattening of the L-T relation, suggesting that (U)LIRGs in the early Universe are typically characterised by a more extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalent sources. Interestingly, the evolution in dust temperature is luminosity dependent, with the fraction of LIRGs with T<35K showing a 2-fold increase from z~0 to z~2, whereas that of ULIRGs with T<35K shows a 6-fold increase.","10.1093/mnras/stt330","60.0","M.

"Seabird species vary in behavioural response to drone census","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide an opportunity to rapidly census wildlife in remote areas while removing some of the hazards. However, wildlife may respond negatively to the UAVs, thereby skewing counts. We surveyed four species of Arctic cliff-nesting seabirds (glaucous gull Larus hyperboreus, Iceland gull Larus glaucoides, common murre Uria aalge and thick-billed murre Uria lomvia) using a UAV and compared censusing techniques to ground photography. An average of 8.5% of murres flew off in response to the UAV, but >99% of those birds were non-breeders. We were unable to detect any impact of the UAV on breeding success of murres, except at a site where aerial predators were abundant and several birds lost their eggs to predators following UAV flights. Furthermore, we found little evidence for habituation by murres to the UAV. Most gulls flew off in response to the UAV, but returned to the nest within five minutes. Counts of gull nests and adults were similar between UAV and ground photography, however the UAV detected up to 52.4% more chicks because chicks were camouflaged and invisible to ground observers. UAVs provide a less hazardous and potentially more accurate method for surveying wildlife. We provide some simple recommendations for their use.","10.1038/s41598-017-18202-3","7.0","Émile Brisson‐Curadeau; David M. Bird; Chantelle Burke; David A. Fifield; Paul Pace; Richard B.

"Estimating census district populations from satellite imagery: Some approaches and limitations","Small-area population densities and counts were estimated for Australian census collection districts (CDs), using Landsat TM imagery. A number of mathematical and statistical refinements to previously reported methods were explored. The robustness of these techniques as a practical methodology for population estimation was investigated and evaluated using a primary image for model development and training, and a second image for validation. Correlations of up to 0.92 in the training set and up to 0.86 in the validation set were obtained between census and remote sensing estimates of CD population density, with median proportional errors of 17.4% and 18.4%, respectively. Total urban populations were estimated with errors of +1% and-3%, respectively. These results indicate a moderate level of accuracy and a substantial degree of robustness. Accuracy was greatest in suburban areas of intermediate population density. There was a general tendency towards attenuation in all models tested, with high densities being under-estimated and low densities being over-estimated. It is concluded that the level of accuracy obtainable with this methodology is limited by heterogeneity within the individual CDs, particularly large rural CDs, and that further improvements are in principle unlikely using the aggregated approach. An alternative statistical approach is foreshadowed.","10.1080/01431160110075901","1.0","Jack Harvey","2002.0","","","census; district; populations; imagery; approaches; limitations"

We also analyze first-time patentees and find similar effects following initial patent application. Together, these results suggest that patenting is indeed associated with real changes within firms, in particular with growth through increases in scope.","10.1162/rest_a_00058","2.0","Natarajan Balasubramanian; Jagadeesh Sivadasan","2010.0","","","firms; patent; new; evidence; u; s; census"
"Max-Min Fairness in IRS-Aided Multi-Cell MISO Systems With Joint Transmit and Reflective Beamforming","This paper investigates an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided multi-cell multiple-input single-output (MISO) network with a set of multi-antenna base stations (BSs) each communicating with multiple single-antenna users, in which an IRS is dedicatedly deployed for assisting the wireless transmission and suppressing the inter-cell interference. Under this setup, we jointly optimize the coordinated transmit beamforming vectors at the BSs and the reflective beamforming vector (with both reflecting phases and amplitudes) at the IRS, for the purpose of maximizing the minimum weighted signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the users, subject to the individual maximum transmit power constraints at the BSs and the reflection constraints at the IRS. To solve the non-convex min-weighted-SINR maximization problem, we first present an exact-alternating-optimization approach to optimize the transmit and reflective beamforming vectors in an alternating manner, in which the transmit and reflective beamforming optimization subproblems are solved exactly in each iteration by using the techniques of second-order-cone program (SOCP) and semi-definite relaxation (SDR), respectively. However, the exact-alternating-optimization approach has high computational complexity, and may lead to compromised performance due to the uncertainty of randomization in SDR. To avoid these drawbacks, we further propose an inexact-alternating-optimization approach, in which the transmit and reflective beamforming optimization subproblems are solved inexactly in each iteration based on the principle of successive convex approximation (SCA). In addition, to further reduce the computational complexity, we propose a low-complexity inexact-alternating-optimization design, in which the reflective beamforming optimization subproblem is solved more inexactly. Via numerical results, it is shown that the proposed three designs achieve significantly increased min-weighted-SINR values, as compared with benchmark schemes without the IRS or with random reflective beamforming. It is also shown that the inexact-alternating-optimization design outperforms the exact-alternating-optimization one in terms of both the achieved min-weighted-SINR value and the computational complexity, while the low-complexity inexact-alternating-optimization design has much lower computational complexity with slightly compromised performance. Furthermore, we show that our proposed design can be applied to the scenario with unit-amplitude reflection constraints, with a negligible performance loss.","10.1109/twc.2020.3033332","3.0","Hailiang Xie; Jie Xu; Ya‐Feng Liu","2020.0","","","max; min; fairness; irs; aided; multi; cell; miso; systems; joint; transmit; reflective; beamforming"
"Aqueous Phase Hydroalkylation and Hydrodeoxygenation of Phenol by Dual Functional Catalysts Comprised of Pd/C and H/La-BEA","Aqueous phase catalytic phenol hydroalkylation and hydrodeoxygenation have been explored using Pd/C combined with zeolite H-BEA and La-BEA catalysts in the presence of H2. The individual steps of phenol hydrogenation, cyclohexanol dehydration, or alkylation with phenol were individually investigated to gain insight into the relative rates in the cascade reactions of phenol hydroalkylation. The hydroalkylation rate, determined by the concentrations of phenol and cyclohexanol in phenol hydroalkylation, required the hydrogenation rate to be relatively slow. The optimized H+/Pd ratio was 21, which allowed achieving comparable cyclohexanol formation rates via phenol hydrogenation and consumption rates from alkylation with phenol in phenol hydroalkylation. La-BEA was shown to be more selective for hydroalkylation than H-BEA in combination with Pd/C, because cyclohexanol dehydration was retarded selectively compared to alkylation of phenol. This indicates that dehydration is solely catalyzed by Brønsted acid sites, while alkylation can be achieved in the presence of La3+ cations.","10.1021/cs300418a","3.0","Chen Zhao; Wenji Song; Johannes A.

"On the accuracy of TIGER-type geocoded address data in relation to cadastral and census areal units","Abstract In many applications of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) a common task is the conversion of addresses into grid coordinates. In many countries this is usually accomplished using address range TIGER-type files in conjunction with geocoding packages within a GIS. Improvements in GIS functionality and the storage capacity of large databases mean that the spatial investigation of data at the individual address level is now commonly performed. This process relies on the accuracy of the geocoding mechanism and this paper examines this accuracy in relation to cadastral records and census tracts. Results from a study of over 20 000 addresses in Sydney, Australia, using a TIGER-type geocoding process suggest that 5-7.5% (depending on geocoding method) of addresses may be misallocated to census tracts, and more than 50% may be given coordinates within the land parcel of a different property.","10.1080/13658810110047221","1.0","Jerry H.

"Regular exercise enhances insulin activation of IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase in human skeletal muscle","Insulin action in skeletal muscle is enhanced by regular exercise. Whether insulin signaling in human skeletal muscle is affected by habitual exercise is not well understood. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) activation is an important step in the insulin-signaling pathway and appears to regulate glucose metabolism via GLUT-4 translocation in skeletal muscle. To examine the effects of regular exercise on PI3-kinase activation, 2-h hyperinsulinemic (40 mU ⋅ m − 2 ⋅ min − 1 )-euglycemic (5.0 mM) clamps were performed on eight healthy exercise-trained [24 ± 1 yr, 71.8 ± 2.0 kg, maximal O 2 uptake (V˙o 2 max ) of 56.1 ± 2.5 ml ⋅ kg − 1 ⋅ min − 1 ] and eight healthy sedentary men and women (24 ± 1 yr, 64.7 ± 4.4 kg,V˙o 2 max of 44.4 ± 2.7 ml ⋅ kg − 1 ⋅ min − 1 ). A [6,6- 2 H]glucose tracer was used to measure hepatic glucose output. A muscle biopsy was obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle at basal and at 2 h of hyperinsulinemia to measure insulin receptor substrate-1(IRS-1)-associated PI3-kinase activation. Insulin concentrations during hyperinsulinemia were similar for both groups (293 ± 22 and 311 ± 22 pM for trained and sedentary, respectively). Insulin-mediated glucose disposal rates (GDR) were greater ( P &lt; 0.05) in the exercise-trained compared with the sedentary control group (9.22 ± 0.95 vs. 6.36 ± 0.57 mg ⋅ kg fat-free mass − 1 ⋅ min − 1 ). Insulin-stimulated PI3-kinase activation was also greater ( P&lt; 0.004) in the trained compared with the sedentary group (3.8 ± 0.5- vs. 1.8 ± 0.2-fold increase from basal). Endurance capacity (V˙o 2 max ) was positively correlated with PI3-kinase activation ( r = 0.53, P &lt; 0.04). There was no correlation between PI3-kinase and muscle morphology. However, increases in GDR were positively related to PI3-kinase activation ( r = 0.60, P &lt; 0.02). We conclude that regular exercise leads to greater insulin-stimulated IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase activation in human skeletal muscle, thus facilitating enhanced insulin-mediated glucose uptake.","10.1152/jappl.2000.88.2.797","7.0","John P.

"Latinos, Race, and the U.S. Census","We identify two dimensions of race for the Latino/Hispanic population in the United States—Latinos as one category among the various categories of the U.S. “ethno-racial pentagon” and racial or color differences among Latinos. In a major change from the previous (two-question) format, the Census Bureau recommends a one-question format for capturing ethno-racial distinctions in the 2020 census, which efficiently captures the Latino population on the first dimension and is consistent with racial classification and identification in the real world. At the same time, it nearly eliminates the problem that the two-question format fostered of classifying many Hispanics as “some other race” while maintaining a similar number of Americans classified as Hispanic or Latino. Whether the Census Bureau adopts the one- or two-question format is yet to be decided as of this writing. However, neither format is sufficient for capturing racial distinctions among the fast-growing Latino population, thus precluding effective monitoring of racial disparities in the United States.","10.1177/0002716218766463","1.0","Edward Telles","2018.0","","","latinos; race; u; s; census"
"A STELLAR CENSUS OF THE TUCANA-HOROLOGIUM MOVING GROUP","We report the selection and spectroscopic confirmation of 129 new late-type (SpT = K3–M6) members of the Tucana–Horologium moving group, a nearby (d ∼ 40 pc), young (τ ∼ 40 Myr) population of comoving stars. We also report observations for 13 of the 17 known Tuc–Hor members in this spectral type range, and that 62 additional candidates are likely to be unassociated field stars; the confirmation frequency for new candidates is therefore 129/191 = 67%. We have used radial velocities, Hα emission, and Li6708 absorption to distinguish between contaminants and bona fide members. Our expanded census of Tuc–Hor increases the known population by a factor of ∼3 in total and by a factor of ∼8 for members with SpT ⩾ K3, but even so, the K–M dwarf population of Tuc–Hor is still markedly incomplete. Our expanded census allows for a much more detailed study of Tuc–Hor than was previously feasible. The spatial distribution of members appears to trace a two-dimensional sheet, with a broad distribution in X and Y, but a very narrow distribution (±5 pc) in Z. The corresponding velocity distribution is very small, with a scatter of ±1.1 km s−1 about the mean UVW velocity for stars spanning the entire 50 pc extent of Tuc–Hor. We also show that the isochronal age (τ ∼ 20–30 Myr) and the lithium depletion boundary age (τ ∼ 40 Myr) disagree, following the trend in other pre-main-sequence populations for isochrones to yield systematically younger ages. The Hα emission line strength follows a trend of increasing equivalent width with later spectral type, as is seen for young clusters. We find that moving group members have been depleted of measurable lithium for spectral types of K7.0–M4.5. None of our targets have significant infrared excesses in the WISE W3 band, yielding an upper limit on warm debris disks of F < 0.7%. Finally, our purely kinematic and color–magnitude selection procedure allows us to test the efficiency and completeness for activity-based selection of young stars. We find that 60% of K–M dwarfs in Tuc–Hor do not have ROSAT counterparts and would have been omitted in X-ray-selected samples. In contrast, GALEX UV-selected samples using a previously suggested criterion for youth achieve completeness of 77% and purity of 78%, and we suggest new SpT-dependent selection criteria that will yield >95% completeness for τ ∼ 40 Myr populations with GALEX data available.","10.1088/0004-6256/147/6/146","4.0","Adam L.

"Latinos, Race, and the U.S. Census","We identify two dimensions of race for the Latino/Hispanic population in the United States—Latinos as one category among the various categories of the U.S. “ethno-racial pentagon” and racial or color differences among Latinos. In a major change from the previous (two-question) format, the Census Bureau recommends a one-question format for capturing ethno-racial distinctions in the 2020 census, which efficiently captures the Latino population on the first dimension and is consistent with racial classification and identification in the real world. At the same time, it nearly eliminates the problem that the two-question format fostered of classifying many Hispanics as “some other race” while maintaining a similar number of Americans classified as Hispanic or Latino. Whether the Census Bureau adopts the one- or two-question format is yet to be decided as of this writing. However, neither format is sufficient for capturing racial distinctions among the fast-growing Latino population, thus precluding effective monitoring of racial disparities in the United States.","10.1177/0002716218766463","1.0","Edward Telles","2018.0","","","latinos; race; u; s; census"
"Trends in Deaths Involving Heroin and Synthetic Opioids Excluding Methadone, and Law Enforcement Drug Product Reports, by Census Region — United States, 2006–2015","Opioid overdose deaths quadrupled from 8,050 in 1999 to 33,091 in 2015 and accounted for 63% of drug overdose deaths in the United States in 2015. During 2010-2015, heroin overdose deaths quadrupled from 3,036 to 12,989 (1). Sharp increases in the supply of heroin and illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF) are likely contributing to increased deaths (2-6). CDC examined trends in unintentional and undetermined deaths involving heroin or synthetic opioids excluding methadone (i.e., synthetic opioids)* by the four U.S. Census regions during 2006-2015. Drug exhibits (i.e., drug products) obtained by law enforcement and reported to the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA's) National Forensic Laboratory Information System (NFLIS) that tested positive for heroin or fentanyl (i.e., drug reports) also were examined. All U.S. Census regions experienced substantial increases in deaths involving heroin from 2006 to 2015. Since 2010, the South and West experienced increases in heroin drug reports, whereas the Northeast and Midwest experienced steady increases during 2006-2015.† In the Northeast, Midwest, and South, deaths involving synthetic opioids and fentanyl drug reports increased considerably after 2013. These broad changes in the U.S. illicit drug market highlight the urgent need to track illicit drugs and enhance public health interventions targeting persons using or at high risk for using heroin or IMF.","10.15585/mmwr.mm6634a2","3.0","Julie O’Donnell; R.

"Expanding the role of synthetic data at the U.S. Census Bureau","National Statistical offices (NSOs) create official statistics from data collected from survey respondents, government administrative records and other sources. The raw source data is usually considered to be confidential. In the case of the U.S. Census Bureau, confidentiality of survey and administrative records microdata is mandated by statute, and this mandate to protect confidentiality is often at odds with the needs of users to extract as much information from the data as possible. Traditional disclosure protection techniques result in official data products that do not fully utilize the information content of the underlying microdata. Typically, these products take the form of simple aggregate tabulations. In a few cases anonymized public-use micro samples are made available, but these face a growing risk of re-identification by the increasing amounts of information about individuals and firms available in the public domain. One approach for overcoming these risks is to release products based on synthetic data where values are simulated from statistical models designed to mimic the (joint) distributions of the underlying microdata. We discuss recent Census Bureau work to develop and deploy such products. We discuss the benefits and challenges involved with extending the scope of synthetic data products in official statistics.","10.3233/sji-140813","3.0","Ron S. Jarmin; Thomas A.

"A<i>SPITZER</i>IRS STUDY OF INFRARED VARIABILITY IN TRANSITIONAL AND PRE-TRANSITIONAL DISKS AROUND T TAURI STARS","We present a Spitzer IRS study of variability in 14 T Tauri stars in the Taurus and Chamaeleon star-forming regions. The sample is composed of transitional and pre-transitional objects which contain holes and gaps in their disks. We detect variability between 5-38 microns in all but two of our objects on timescales of 2-3 years. Most of the variability observed can be classified as seesaw behavior, whereby the emission at shorter wavelengths varies inversely with the emission at longer wavelengths. For many of the objects we can reasonably reproduce the observed variability using irradiated disk models, particularly by changing the height of the inner disk wall by ~20%. When the inner wall is taller, the emission at the shorter wavelengths is higher since the inner wall dominates the emission at 2-8 microns. The taller inner wall casts a larger shadow on the outer disk wall, leading to less emission at wavelengths beyond 20 microns where the outer wall dominates. We discuss how the possible presence of planets in these disks could lead to warps which cause changes in the height of the inner wall. We also find that crystalline silicates are common in the outer disks of our objects and that in the four disks in the sample with the most crystalline silicates, variability on timescales of 1 week is present. In addition to explaining the infrared variability described above, planets can create shocks and collisions which can crystallize the dust and lead to short timescale variability.","10.1088/0004-637x/728/1/49","8.0","Catherine Espaillat; Elise Furlan; Paola D’Alessio; B.

"Muslims in the 2001 Census of England and Wales: Gender and economic disadvantage","Abstract The article presents new data for the Muslim population of Britain from the 2001 Census. It uses the cross tabulations of ethnicity by religion to back-project the growth of the Muslim population from 21,000 in 1951 to 1.6 millions in 2001. It examines the social, economic, demographic and geographic characteristics of the population. Although Muslims are often represented as a homogenous group, there are considerable internal differences, so that the characteristics of the population as a whole do not apply to all groups within. The 2001 Census shows that two-thirds of British Muslims are ethnically Pakistani, Indian and Bangladeshi, but one-third comes from diverse European, African, North African, Middle Eastern and other Asian sources. Nevertheless, Muslim gender roles emerge as a critical differentiator of socio-economic vulnerability. Taken as a whole, the Muslim population is young and rapidly growing; its socio-economic profile is depressed, marked by the exceptionally low participation rate of women in the formal labour market, and by high concentration in areas of multiple deprivation.

"Estimation of Snowmelt Runoff in Beas Basin, India","Abstract Estimation of snowmelt runoff is very important in the Western Himalayan rivers in India where it is required to plan for hydropower generation and the water management during the non‐monsoon season. An attempt has been made to estimate snowmelt runoff on a 10 day average basis in Beas Basin up to Pandoh Dam during May, 1998 and November, 1999 using a Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM), which is a degree day method. The input parameters for the model are derived from existing maps, satellite data, metrological and hydrological data. The relief of the basin is divided into 12 elevation zones of 500 m each. The temperature was extrapolated to these elevation zones using temperature lapse rate calculated using the observed temperature at seven stations within the basin. Snow covered area in the basin was determined using Indian Remote Sensing Satellites IRS ‐ 1C / 1D Wide Field Sensor (WIFS). The runoff from the snow covered area and snow free area was separately calculated in each elevation zone. The model parameter degree‐day factor is taken from literature and runoff coefficients for snow and rain are derived using the observed data. The total discharge at the dam site is computed by a weighted sum of runoff components from all the elevation zones. There is a good agreement between the observed and computed runoff with a coefficient of determination of 0.854 and the difference in volume is + 4.6 %.","10.1080/10106040508542344","2.0","Vajja Hari Prasad; Partha Roy","2005.0","","","snowmelt; runoff; beas; basin; india"
"Efficient Channel Estimation for Double-IRS Aided Multi-User MIMO System","To achieve the more significant passive beamforming gain in the double-intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided system over the conventional single-IRS counterpart, channel state information (CSI) is indispensable in practice but also more challenging to acquire, due to the presence of not only the single- but also double-reflection links that are intricately coupled and also entail more channel coefficients for estimation. In this paper, we propose a new and efficient channel estimation scheme for the double-IRS aided multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system to resolve the cascaded CSI of both its single- and double-reflection links. First, for the single-user case, the single- and double-reflection channels are efficiently estimated at the multi-antenna base station (BS) with both the IRSs turned ON (for maximal signal reflection), by exploiting the fact that their cascaded channel coefficients are scaled versions of their superimposed lower-dimensional CSI. Then, the proposed channel estimation scheme is extended to the multi-user case, where given an arbitrary user's cascaded channel (estimated as in the single-user case), the other users' cascaded channels can also be expressed as lower-dimensional scaled versions of it and thus efficiently estimated at the BS. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation scheme and joint training reflection design for double IRSs, as compared to various benchmark schemes.","10.1109/tcomm.2021.3064947","3.0","Beixiong Zheng; Changsheng You; Rui Zhang","2021.0","","","channel; double; irs; aided; multi; user; mimo"
"An Insight into the Process Involved in Hydrothermal Conversion of FAU to *BEA Zeolite","The use of FAU zeolite as a starting material was found to enhance the crystallization rate of *BEA zeolite, suggesting that the dissolution of FAU zeolite provides locally ordered aluminosilicate species that assemble and evolve into *BEA zeolite. Here we show experimental findings that indicate the presence of such locally ordered aluminosilicate species in intermediate phases involved in the hydrothermal conversion of FAU zeolite into *BEA zeolite. On the basis of the previous fact that cetyltrimethylammonium (CTA+) cations seem to be able to preserve zeolitic fragments or seeds and retain them in the mesoporous framework, this method was applied to the characterization of the obtained intermediate phases. From the detailed characterization of mesoporous products, the different characteristics were found to be observed between intermediate phases. Namely, as the more disordered arrangement was found in the mesoporous products, the presence of evolved, locally ordered aluminosilicate species was strongly indicated.","10.1021/cm703676y","4.0","Hery Jon; Nobuaki Ikawa; Yasunori Oumi; Tsuneji Sano","2008.0","","","involved; hydrothermal; conversion; fau; bea; zeolite"
"Controlling the IRS: Principals, Principles, and Public Administration","Theory: The behavior of government agencies reflects democratic principles of equal treatment and efficiency as well as the more-studied principle of responsiveness to elected political principals. Hypothesis: The variance in IRS enforcement actions against individual and corporate taxpayers across states and time can be explained by measures reflecting equal treatment of taxpayers, enforcement efficiency, and responsiveness to elected officials. Methods: We test the hypothesis using regression analysis of a pooled time-series of state-level audits of corporate and individual tax returns for the period of 1974-92. Results: The odds of corporate versus individual audits increase with increased Democratic control over Congress and change with different presidential administrations, but not with changes in state-level partisanship. The odds also respond significantly to changes in the composition of the taxpaying district and revenue base, suggesting IRS responsiveness to equity and efficiency.","10.2307/2991750","2.0","John T.

"Beamforming Optimization for IRS-Aided Communications With Transceiver Hardware Impairments","In this paper, we focus on intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted multi-antenna communications with transceiver hardware impairments encountered in practice. In particular, we aim to maximize the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) taking into account the impact of hardware impairments, where the source transmit beamforming and the IRS reflect beamforming are jointly designed under the proposed optimization framework. To circumvent the non-convexity of the formulated design problem, we first derive a closed-form optimal solution to the source transmit beamforming. Then, for the optimization of IRS reflect beamforming, we obtain an upper bound to the optimal objective value via solving a single convex problem. A low-complexity minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm was developed to approach the upper bound. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed beamforming design is more robust to the hardware impairments than that of the conventional SNR maximized scheme. Moreover, compared to the scenario without deploying an IRS, the performance gain brought by incorporating the hardware impairments is more evident for the IRS-aided communications.","10.1109/tcomm.2020.3033575","5.0","Hong Shen; Wei Xu; Shulei Gong; Chunming Zhao; Derrick Wing Kwan Ng","2020.0","","","optimization; irs; aided; communications; transceiver; hardware; impairments"

"Making sense of surveys and censuses: Issues in religious self-identification","Censuses and surveys shape decisions, discourse and debates about people and their lived environments. The outcomes, in the case of a census, inform governments about resource distribution but also shape people's self-understanding about who they are and where they may be going. How people self-identify on censuses and surveys produces certain types of knowledge. This introduction emphasises the impact of those instruments on knowledge production and how numbers can be employed, often anecdotally, to further interests and claims. The way academics use and interpret such instruments has ethical and normative dimensions: numbers are not neutral but shape and are shaped by perceptions and identities. This introduction to a thematic issue of Religion introduces the contributing authors' diverse – historical, qualitative and quantitative – approaches that work together to produce their own kind of multi-disciplinary, academically located knowledge.","10.1080/0048721x.2014.929833","2.0","Abby Day; Lois Lee","2014.0","","","sense; surveys; censuses; issues; self; identification"
"On tree census and the giant component in sparse random graphs","Abstract For each of the two models of a sparse random graph on n vertices, G(n, # of edges = cn /2) and G ( n, Prob (edge) = c/n) define t n (k) as the total number of tree components of size k (1 ≤ k ≤ n). the random sequence {[t n (k) ‐ nh(k)]n −1/2 } is shown to be Gaussian in the limit n →∞, with h(k) = k k−2 c k−1 e −kc /k! and covariance function being dependent upon the model. This general result implies, in particular, that, for c&gt; 1, the size of the giant component is asymptotically Gaussian, with mean nθ(c) and variance n(1 − T) −2 (1 − 2Tθ)θ(1 − θ) for the first model and n(1 − T) −2 θ(1 − θ) for the second model. Here Te −T = ce −c , T &lt;1, and θ = 1 − T/c . A close technique allows us to prove that, for c &lt; 1, the independence number of G(n, p = c/n) is asymptotically Gaussian with mean nc −1 ( β + β 2 /2 ) and variance n [ c −1 (β + β 2 /2) − c −2 ( c + 1)β 2 ], where βe β = c. It is also proven that almost surely the giant component consists of a giant two‐connected core of size about n (1 − T )β and a “mantle” of trees, and possibly few small unicyclic graphs, each sprouting from its own vertex of the core.","10.1002/rsa.3240010306","1.0","Boris Pittel","1990.0","","","census; component; random; graphs"
"A Nation Still Dividing: The British Census and Social Polarisation 1971–2001","This paper presents an analysis of the degree to which the population of Britain has become more or less geographically polarised as compared with 1991 and earlier censuses. We use the Key Statistics for local authorities from the 2001 Census, released on 13 February 2003 by the census authorities. All of the variables from the 26 Key Statistics tables which can be compared over time with the 1991 Census are examined. The analysis is then extended for a subset of variables that were similarly measured in 1971 and 1981. We conclude that for key aspects of life in Britain, as recorded by the censuses, the nation has continued in the 1990s to divide socially geographically, often at a faster rate than was occurring in the 1980s or 1970s. Where there appears to have been a reduction in polarisation it tends to have been for those aspects of life which are now poorly measured by the census. The paper concludes with speculation about the possible reasons for the continued division of the country into areas now more easily than ever typified as being old and young, settled and migrant, black and white, or rich and poor. Finally the potential for the continued sociospatial polarisation of Britain is discussed. The paper begins with a fictional vignette.","10.1068/a3692","2.0","Danny Dorling; Philip Rees","2003.0","","","nation; census; social; polarisation"
"Nuclear IRS‐1 and cancer","The family of insulin receptor substrates (IRS) consists of four proteins (IRS-1-IRS-4), which were initially characterized as typical cytosolic adaptor proteins involved in insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) signaling. The first cloned and characterized member of the IRS family, IRS-1, has a predicted molecular weight of 132 kDa, however, as a result of its extensive serine phosphorylation it separates on a SDS gel as a band of approximately 160-185 kDa. In addition to its metabolic and growth-promoting functions, IRS-1 is also suspected to play a role in malignant transformation. The mechanism by which IRS-1 supports tumor growth is not fully understood, and the argument that IRS-1 merely amplifies the signal from the IGF-1R and/or IR requires further investigation. Almost a decade ago, we reported the presence of nuclear IRS-1 in medulloblastoma clinical samples, which express viral oncoprotein, large T-antigen of human polyomavirus JC (JCV T-antigen). This first demonstration of nuclear IRS-1 was confirmed by several other laboratories. Nuclear IRS-1 was also detected by cells expressing the SV40 T-antigen, v-Src, in immortalized fibroblasts stimulated with IGF-I, in hepatocytes, 32D cells, and in an osteosarcoma cell line. More recently, nuclear IRS-1 was detected in breast cancer cells in association with estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), and in JC virus negative medulloblastoma cells expressing estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), further implicating nuclear IRS-1 in cellular transformation. Here, we discuss how nuclear IRS-1 acting on DNA repair fidelity, transcriptional activity, and cell growth can support tumor development and progression.","10.1002/jcp.24019","4.0","Krzysztof Reiss; Luis Del Valle; Adam Lassak; Joanna Trojanek","2011.0","","","irs; cancer"

"Meeting the Cool Neighbors. VIII. A Preliminary 20 Parsec Census from the NLTT Catalogue","Continuing our census of late-type dwarfs in the solar neighborhood, we present BVRI photometry and optical spectroscopy of 800 mid-type M dwarfs drawn from the NLTT proper-motion catalog. The targets are taken both from our own cross-referencing of the NLTT Catalogue and the 2MASS Second Incremental Data Release, and from the revised NLTT compiled recently by Salim & Gould. All are identified as nearby-star candidates based on their location in the (mr, mr-Ks) diagram. Three hundred stars discussed here have previous astrometric, photometric, or spectroscopic observations. We present new BVRI photometry for 101 stars, together with low-resolution spectroscopy of a further 400 dwarfs. In total, we find that 241 stars are within 20 pc of the Sun, while a further 70 lie within 1 σ of our distance limit. Combining the present results with previous analyses, we have quantitative observations for 1910 of the 1913 candidates in our NLTT nearby-star samples. Eight hundred fifteen of those stars have distance estimates of 20 pc or less, including 312 additions to the local census. With our NLTT follow-up observations essentially complete, we have searched the literature for K and early-type M dwarfs within the sampling volume covered by the 2MASS second release. Comparing the resultant 20 pc census against predicted numbers, derived from the 8 pc luminosity function, shows an overall deficit of ∼20% for stellar systems and ∼35% for individual stars. Almost all are likely to be fainter than MJ = 7, and at least half are probably as yet undiscovered companions of known nearby stars. Our results suggest that there are relatively few missing systems at the lowest luminosities, MJ > 8.5. We discuss possible means of identifying the missing stars.","10.1086/421374","12.0","I.

"IRS-Enhanced OFDM: Power Allocation and Passive Array Optimization","Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising new technology for achieving spectrum and energy efficient wireless communication systems in the future. By adaptively varying the incident signals' phases/amplitudes and thereby establishing favorable channel responses through a large number of reconfigurable passive reflecting elements, IRS is able to enhance the communication performance of mobile users in its vicinity cost- effectively. In this paper, we study an IRS- enhanced orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system in which an IRS is deployed to assist the communication between a nearby user and its associated base station (BS). We aim to maximize the downlink achievable rate for the user by jointly optimizing the transmit power allocation at the BS and the passive array reflection coefficients at the IRS. Although the formulated problem is non-convex and thus difficult to solve, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution for it, by alternately optimizing the BS's power allocation and the IRS's passive array coefficients in an iterative manner, along with a customized method for the initialization. Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly improves the OFDM link rate performance as compared to the cases without the IRS or with other heuristic IRS designs.","10.1109/globecom38437.2019.9014204","3.0","Yifei Yang; Shuowen Zhang; Rui Zhang","2019.0","","","irs; enhanced; ofdm; power; allocation; passive; array; optimization"

"Women, Children, and Industrialization in the Early Republic: Evidence from the Manufacturing Censuses","The first half of the nineteenth century was a critical juncture regarding the emergence of female participation in the market economy, the increase in the wage of females relative to that of adult males, and the evolution of large scale firms in both mechanized and non-mechanized industries.We present the first systematic and comprehensive description of these events as they evolved in the states of the Northeast to 1850.Our sources are primarily samples taken from three early censuses and reports of manufacturing, 1820, 1832, and 1850.Our principal findings are: (1) that women and children composed a large share (over 40% in 1832) of the entire manufacturing labor force during the initial period of industrialization in the U.S., but that this share began a secular decline as early as 1840; (2) that the wage of females (and boys) relative to that of adult males rose wherever large scale manufacturing establishments spread and that by 1850 this ratio had risen to almost 90% its long-term level; (3) that the labor force participation of young unmarried women in the industrial counties of the Northeast was, in 1832, high by late nineteenth century standards; and (4) that the employment of females and boys was closely associated with production processes used by large-scale establishments.Women and children had been a previously under-utilized and large segment of the potential labor force, and their harnessing by manufacturing was a critical factor in the industrialization of the Northeast.","10.3386/w0795","2.0","Claudia Goldin; Kenneth L.

"The use of differential privacy for census data and its impact on redistricting: The case of the 2020 U.S. Census","Census statistics play a key role in public policy decisions and social science research. However, given the risk of revealing individual information, many statistical agencies are considering disclosure control methods based on differential privacy, which add noise to tabulated data. Unlike other applications of differential privacy, however, census statistics must be postprocessed after noise injection to be usable. We study the impact of the U.S. Census Bureau’s latest disclosure avoidance system (DAS) on a major application of census statistics, the redrawing of electoral districts. We find that the DAS systematically undercounts the population in mixed-race and mixed-partisan precincts, yielding unpredictable racial and partisan biases. While the DAS leads to a likely violation of the “One Person, One Vote” standard as currently interpreted, it does not prevent accurate predictions of an individual’s race and ethnicity. Our findings underscore the difficulty of balancing accuracy and respondent privacy in the Census.","10.1126/sciadv.abk3283","6.0","Christopher T Kenny; Shiro Kuriwaki; Cory McCartan; Evan T. R.

"Census-independent population mapping in northern Nigeria","Although remote sensing has long been used to aid in the estimation of population, it has usually been in the context of spatial disaggregation of national census data, with the census counts serving both as observational data for specifying models and as constraints on model outputs. Here we present a framework for estimating populations from the bottom up, entirely independently of national census data, a critical need in areas without recent and reliable census data. To make observations of population density, we replace national census data with a microcensus, in which we enumerate population for a sample of small areas within the states of Kano and Kaduna in northern Nigeria. Using supervised texture-based classifiers with very high resolution satellite imagery, we produce a binary map of human settlement at 8-meter resolution across the two states and then a more refined classification consisting of 7 residential types and 1 non-residential type. Using the residential types and a model linking them to the population density observations, we produce population estimates across the two states in a gridded raster format, at approximately 90-meter resolution. We also demonstrate a simulation framework for capturing uncertainty and presenting estimates as prediction intervals for any region of interest of any size and composition within the study region. Used in concert with previously published demographic estimates, our population estimates allowed for predictions of the population under 5 in ten administrative wards that fit strongly with reference data collected during polio vaccination campaigns.","10.1016/j.rse.2017.09.024","9.0","Eric Weber; Vincent Seaman; Robert Stewart; Tomas J.

"Delay-Optimal Scheduling for IRS-Aided Mobile Edge Computing","In this letter, we consider an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided mobile edge computing (MEC) system, where an IRS is deployed to assist computation offloading from two users to an access point connected with an edge cloud. For the IRS-aided data transmission, in contrast to the conventional non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) and time-division multiple-access (TDMA), we propose a new flexible time-sharing NOMA scheme that allows users to flexibly divide their data into two parts transmitted via NOMA and TDMA, respectively, thus encapsulating both conventional NOMA and TDMA as special cases. We formulate an optimization problem to minimize the sum delay of the two users by designing the IRS passive reflection and users' computation-offloading scheduling under the IRS discrete-phase constraint. Although this problem is non-convex, we obtain its optimal solution for both the cases of infinite and finite cloud computing capacities. Furthermore, we show that NOMA and TDMA based transmissions are preferred in different scenarios, depending on the users' cloud-computing time as well as the rate discrepancy between NOMA and TDMA with IRS.","10.1109/lwc.2020.3042189","3.0","Fasheng Zhou; Changsheng You; Rui Zhang","2020.0","","","delay; optimal; scheduling; irs; aided; mobile; edge; computing"
"A stellar census in globular clusters with MUSE: Binaries in NGC 3201","We utilize multi-epoch MUSE spectroscopy to study binaries in the core of NGC 3201. Our sample consists of 3553 stars with 54883 spectra in total comprising 3200 main-sequence stars up to 4 magnitudes below the turn-off. Each star in our sample has between 3 and 63 (with a median of 14) reliable radial velocity (RV) measurements within five years of observations. We introduce a statistical method to determine the probability of a star showing RV variations based on the whole inhomogeneous RV sample. Using HST photometry and an advanced dynamical MOCCA simulation of this specific GC we overcome observational biases that previous spectroscopic studies had to deal with. This allows us to infer a binary frequency in the MUSE FoV and enables us to deduce the underlying true binary frequency of (6.75+-0.72) % in NGC 3201. The comparison of the MUSE observations with the MOCCA simulation suggests a significant fraction of primordial binaries. We can also confirm a radial increase of the binary fraction towards the GC centre due to mass segregation. We discovered that in our sample at least (57.5+-7.9) % of blue straggler stars (BSS) are in a binary system. For the first time in a study of GCs, we were able to fit Keplerian orbits to a significant sample of 95 binaries. We present the binary system properties of eleven BSS and show evidence that two BSS formation scenarios, the mass transfer in binary (or triple) star systems and the coalescence due to binary-binary interactions, are present in our data. We also describe the binary and spectroscopic properties of four sub-subgiant (or red straggler) stars. Furthermore, we discovered two new black hole (BH) candidates with minimum masses (Msini) of (7.68+-0.50) M_sun, (4.4+-2.8) M_sun, and refine the minimum mass estimate on the already published BH to (4.53+-0.21) M_sun. These BHs are consistent with an extensive BH subsystem hosted by NGC 3201.","10.1051/0004-6361/201936203","11.0","Benjamin Giesers; Sebastian Kamann; S.

"On the Performance of Multi-Antenna IRS-Assisted NOMA Networks With Continuous and Discrete IRS Phase Shifting","In this paper we study an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network where the direct link between the base station (BS) and one of the users is blocked and the IRS is deployed to serve the blocked user. The IRS designs under both the ideal IRS with continuous phase shifting and the non-ideal IRS with discrete phase shifting are considered. For both cases, by leveraging the isotropic random vector and the Laguerre series, we derive insightful results and closed-form expressions on performance measures including the average required transmit power, the outage probability, and the diversity order. Our analytical results show that the transmit power scales down linearly with the BS antenna number and quadratically with the IRS element number. The diversity order equals the smaller of the BS antenna number and the IRS element number with a scaling coefficient. Our results also reveal the effect of the phase quantization resolution to the system performance when non-ideal IRS is used. Numerical results are provided to validate the accuracy of our analysis and the non-ideal IRS with four or more bits for quantization is shown to achieve nearly the same performance as the ideal IRS.","10.1109/twc.2021.3117494","2.0","Zeyu Sun; Yindi Jing","2021.0","","","performance; multi; antenna; irs; assisted; noma; networks; continuous; discrete; phase"

"General Acid-Type Catalysis in the Dehydrative Aromatization of Furans to Aromatics in H-[Al]-BEA, H-[Fe]-BEA, H-[Ga]-BEA, and H-[B]-BEA Zeolites","Al, Ga, Fe, and B metal substituents have been examined for their ability to change the Brønsted acid strength of BEA zeolite and inhibit undesired hydrolysis in the production of aromatics from furan, 2-methylfuran, and 2,5-dimethylfuran. We employed electronic structure calculations to examine this series of furans in H-[Al]-, H-[Fe]-, H-[Ga]-, and H-[B]-BEA zeolites. These calculations were used to parametrize a microkinetic model to make direct comparisons to experiments run with furan and DMF in the weakest and strongest acid zeolites, H-[B]-BEA and H-[Al]-BEA, respectively. Electronic structure calculations revealed that the Diels–Alder reaction remains unaffected by changes to the Brønsted acid strength of the zeolite, whereas the dehydration and hydrolysis reactions are affected in a fashion reminiscent of general acid catalysis. Interestingly, despite its significantly lower acid strength, H-[B]-BEA was experimentally shown to have an activity similar to that of H-[Al]-BEA for the production of both benzene and p-xylene from furan and 2,5-dimethylfuran, respectively. Analysis with the microkinetic model revealed that, even with this weaker heterogeneous acid site, the dehydration reaction is sufficiently catalyzed, activating the aromatic production pathway. The use of a weaker, heterogeneous Brønsted-acidic zeolite did not have a significant effect on the product selectivity, however, indicating that the same reaction pathways are active with both catalysts.","10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b02344","5.0","Ryan E.

"Differential Privacy and Census Data: Implications for Social and Economic Research","The Census Bureau has announced new methods for disclosure control in public use data products. The new approach, known as differential privacy, represents a radical departure from current practice. In its pure form, differential privacy techniques may make the release of useful microdata impossible and limit the utility of tabular small-area data. Adoption of differential privacy will have far-reaching consequences for research. It is likely that scientists, planners, and the public will lose the free access we have enjoyed for six decades to reliable public Census Bureau data describing US social and economic change.","10.1257/pandp.20191107","4.0","Steven Ruggles; Catherine A Fitch; Diana L.

"A Model to Estimate the Population Contributing to the Wastewater Using Samples Collected on Census Day","An important uncertainty when estimating per capita consumption of, for example, illicit drugs by means of wastewater analysis (sometimes referred to as ""sewage epidemiology"") relates to the size and variability of the de facto population in the catchment of interest. In the absence of a day-specific direct population count any indirect surrogate model to estimate population size lacks a standard to assess associated uncertainties. Therefore, the objective of this study was to collect wastewater samples at a unique opportunity, that is, on a census day, as a basis for a model to estimate the number of people contributing to a given wastewater sample. Mass loads for a wide range of pharmaceuticals and personal care products were quantified in influents of ten sewage treatment plants (STP) serving populations ranging from approximately 3500 to 500 000 people. Separate linear models for population size were estimated with the mass loads of the different chemical as the explanatory variable: 14 chemicals showed good, linear relationships, with highest correlations for acesulfame and gabapentin. De facto population was then estimated through Bayesian inference, by updating the population size provided by STP staff (prior knowledge) with measured chemical mass loads. Cross validation showed that large populations can be estimated fairly accurately with a few chemical mass loads quantified from 24-h composite samples. In contrast, the prior knowledge for small population sizes cannot be improved substantially despite the information of multiple chemical mass loads. In the future, observations other than chemical mass loads may improve this deficit, since Bayesian inference allows including any kind of information relating to population size.","10.1021/es403251g","8.0","Jake O’Brien; Phong K.

"Factors associated with small-scale agricultural machinery adoption in Bangladesh: Census findings","There is strong advocacy for agricultural machinery appropriate for smallholder farmers in South Asia. Such 'scale-appropriate' machinery can increase returns to land and labour, although the still substantial capital investment required can preclude smallholder ownership. Increasing machinery demand has resulted in relatively well-developed markets for rental services for tillage, irrigation, and post-harvest operations. Many smallholders thereby access agricultural machinery that may have otherwise been cost prohibitive to purchase through fee-for-service arrangements, though opportunity for expansion remains. To more effectively facilitate the development and investment in scale-appropriate machinery, there is a need to better understand the factors associated with agricultural machinery purchases and service provision. This paper first reviews Bangladesh's historical policy environment that facilitated the development of agricultural machinery markets. It then uses recent Bangladesh census data from 814,058 farm households to identify variables associated with the adoption of the most common smallholder agricultural machinery - irrigation pumps, threshers, and power tillers (mainly driven by two-wheel tractors). Multinomial probit model results indicate that machinery ownership is positively associated with household assets, credit availability, electrification, and road density. These findings suggest that donors and policy makers should focus not only on short-term projects to boost machinery adoption. Rather, sustained emphasis on improving physical and civil infrastructure and services, as well as assuring credit availability, is also necessary to create an enabling environment in which the adoption of scale-appropriate farm machinery is most likely.","10.1016/j.jrurstud.2016.06.012","3.0","Khondoker Abdul Mottaleb; Timothy J.

"Association of IRS-1 with the insulin receptor and the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase. Formation of binary and ternary signaling complexes in intact cells.","Insulin stimulates the formation of binary and ternary signaling complexes between the phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3'-kinase, IRS-1, and the insulin receptor in vivo. Binary complex formation between IRS-1 and the PtdIns 3'-kinase occurs in intact cells and requires the tyrosyl phosphorylation IRS-1, as mutant insulin receptors which weakly phosphorylate IRS-1 in vivo do not mediate formation of IRS-1/PtdIns 3'-kinase complexes in transfected CHO cells. Association with IRS-1 involves as much as 70% of total cellular PtdIns 3'-kinase activity. Insulin also stimulates the formation of ternary signaling complexes, as both IRS-1 and the PtdIns 3'-kinase are present in anti-insulin receptor immunoprecipitates from insulin-stimulated cells. Overexpression of IRS-1 in CHO cells increases the amount of PtdIns 3'-kinase activity in alpha IR immunoprecipitates, and IRS-1 markedly increases the in vitro binding of p85 alpha and PtdIns 3-kinase activity to anti-receptor immunoprecipitates. The mechanism for this association is unknown, but appears to involve the binding of IRS-1/PtdIns 3'-kinase complexes to the insulin receptor. The formation of binary and ternary complexes between the insulin receptor, IRS-1 and the PtdIns 3'-kinase may play a critical role in transmission of the insulin signal.","10.1016/s0021-9258(18)53083-0","7.0","Jonathan Backer; Martin G.

In many cases, these clusters are the only prominent source within a few kiloparsecs from the galaxy nucleus. We present surface brightness profiles, derived from elliptical isophote fits, of all galaxies for which the fit was successful. We use the fitted isophotes at radii larger than 2'' to check whether the location of the cluster coincides with the photocenter of the galaxy and confirm that in nearly all cases, we are truly dealing with ""nuclear"" star clusters. From analytical fits to the surface brightness profiles, we derive the cluster luminosities after subtraction of the light contribution from the underlying galaxy disk and/or bulge.","10.1086/339025","7.0","Torsten Böker; Seppo Laine; Roeland P. van der Marel; M.

Mundt, R. ; Stocke, J. ; Strom, S. E. ; Strom, K. M. ; Anderson, E. R. Abstract A medium-resolution spectrum of the optically obscured young stellar object L1551 IRS 5 was obtained by observing the brightest parts of its associated reflection nebula. The H-alpha line in L1551 IRS 5 shows a P Cygni profile which is characterized by a strong, violet-displaced absorption component (-300 km/s) and a very weak emission component. Quite similar H-alpha line profiles are observed in FU Orionis stars, but not in T Tauri stars. The spectrum of IRS 5 also exhibits a broad absorption feature at 6497 A and possibly Li I 6707 absorption. From the strength of this former feature (a blend of Ca I, Fe I, and Ba II lines), a spectral type of G-K can be estimated. These characteristics suggest that L1551 IRS 5 is analogous to stars of the FU Ori class.

"Historical Census Record Linkage","For the past 80 years, social scientists have been linking historical censuses across time to study economic and geographic mobility. In recent decades, the quantity of historical census record linkage has exploded, owing largely to the advent of new machine-readable data created by genealogical organizations. Investigators are examining economic and geographic mobility across multiple generations and also engaging many new topics. Several analysts are exploring the effects of early-life socioeconomic conditions, environmental exposures, or natural disasters on family, health, and economic outcomes in later life. Other studies exploit natural experiments to gauge the impact of policy interventions such as social welfare programs and educational reforms. The new data sources have led to a proliferation of record linkage methodologies, and some widespread approaches inadvertently introduce errors that can lead to false inferences. A new generation of large-scale shared data infrastructure now in preparation will ameliorate weaknesses of current linkage methods.","10.1146/annurev-soc-073117-041447","3.0","Steven Ruggles; Catherine A Fitch; Evan Roberts","2018.0","","","census; record; linkage"
"A LOFAR census of millisecond pulsars","We report the detection of 48 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) out of 75 observed thus far using the LOFAR in the frequency range 110-188 MHz. We have also detected three MSPs out of nine observed in the frequency range 38-77 MHz. This is the largest sample of MSPs ever observed at these low frequencies, and half of the detected MSPs were observed for the first time at frequencies below 200 MHz. We present the average pulse profiles of the detected MSPs, their effective pulse widths, and flux densities and compare these with higher observing frequencies. The flux-calibrated, multifrequency LOFAR pulse profiles are publicly available via the EPN Database of Pulsar Profiles. We also present average values of dispersion measures (DM) and discuss DM and profile variations. About 35% of the MSPs show strong narrow profiles, another 25% exhibit scattered profiles, and the rest are only weakly detected. A qualitative comparison of LOFAR profiles with those at higher radio frequencies shows constant separation between profile components. Similarly, the profile widths are consistent with those observed at higher frequencies, unless scattering dominates at the lowest frequencies. This is very different from what is observed for normal pulsars and suggests a compact emission region in the MSP magnetosphere. The amplitude ratio of the profile components, on the other hand, can dramatically change towards low frequencies, often with the trailing component becoming dominant. As previously demonstrated this can be caused by aberration and retardation. This data set enables high-precision studies of pulse profile evolution with frequency, dispersion, Faraday rotation, and scattering in the interstellar medium. Characterising and correcting these systematic effects may improve pulsar-timing precision at higher observing frequencies, where pulsar timing array projects aim to directly detect gravitational waves.","10.1051/0004-6361/201527178","32.0","V.

"The IRS-2 Gene on Murine Chromosome 8 Encodes a Unique Signaling Adapter for Insulin and Cytokine Action","Signal transduction by insulin and IGF-1, several interleukins (IL-2, IL-4, IL-9, IL-13), interferons, GH, and other cytokines involves IRS proteins, which link the receptors for these factors to signaling molecules with Src homology-2 domains (SH2-proteins). We recently reported the amino acid sequence of murine IRS-2; in order to examine a potential genetic role for this molecule in disease, we isolated the murine IRS-2 gene and compared the expression pattern of IRS-2 against IRS-1. Like IRS-1, IRS-2 is encoded by a single exon. Whereas IRS-1 is located on murine chomosome 1, IRS-2 is located on murine chromosome 8 near the insulin receptor. IRS-2 is expressed together with IRS-1 in many cells and tissues; however, IRS-2 predominates in murine hematopoietic cells where it may be essential for cytokine signaling; IRS-1 predominates in adipocytes and differentiated 3T3-L1 cells where it contributes to the normal insulin response. In 32D cells, IRS-1 and IRS-2 undergo differential tyrosine phosphorylation during insulin or IL-4 stimulation, as assessed indirectly by interaction with various recombinant SH2 domains. Thus, signaling specificity through the IRS proteins may be accomplished by specific expression patterns and distinct phosphorylation patterns during interaction with various activated receptors.","10.1210/mend.11.2.9885","12.0","Xiao‐Jian Sun; Sebastián Pons; Ling-Mei Wang; Yitao Zhang; Lynne Yenush; Deborah J.

"Phenotyping and Cytokine Regulation of the BEAS-2B Human Bronchial Epithelial Cell: Demonstration of Inducible Expression of the Adhesion Molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1","Airway epithelium may actively participate in inflammatory responses, such as occur in asthma. The presence and regulation of surface molecules on the airway epithelium, however, is incompletely understood. We have determined the phenotype of the human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B by flow cytometry. We confirmed previous observations that human bronchial epithelial cells constitutively express CD29, CD44, CD49a, CD49b, CD49c, CD49d, CD49e, CD49f, CD51, CD54 (ICAM-1), CD61, and HLA class 1. BEAS-2B cells were also found to constitutively express CD9, CD13, CD15, CD15s, CD23, CD33, CD36, CD40, CD41b, CD42b, CD48, CD50, CD71, and CD102 (ICAM-2). Culture of BEAS-2B cells with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or interleukin (IL)-1beta (1 ng/ml) was found to enhance intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression (several fold) and induce de novo CD106 [vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)] expression. TNF-alpha or IL-1beta did not change the expression of CD9, CD13, CD16, CD23, CD29, CD31, CD32, CD35, CD45, CD61, or CD64 in BEAS-2B cells. IL-4 (1 ng/ml) also induced expression of VCAM-1 (1.5-fold) but not ICAM- expression while interferon-gamma (1 ng/ml) enhanced only ICAM-1 expression (2-fold). Maximal VCAM-1 expression was obtained with the combination of TNF-alpha and IL-4 (8-fold). Using Northern blot hybridization analysis, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 mRNA was detected in BEAS-2B cells stimulated with cytokines. VCAM-1 on stimulated BEAS-2B was functionally active as determined by adhesion of purified eosinophils and blockade with specific antibodies. Primary isolates of bronchial epithelial cells produced detectable levels of VCAM-1 protein and mRNA as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. These results suggest that cytokine activation induces expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on airway epithelium, an event which may influence leukocyte infiltration and activation.","10.1165/ajrcmb.17.5.2685","6.0","Jun Atsuta; Sherry A.

A prerequisite for such applications is the provision of data syntheses for individual microfossil groups. Specific to such syntheses is the necessity of taxonomical harmonisation across the constituent datasets, coupled with dereplication of previous compilations. Both of these aspects require expert knowledge, but with increasing number of records involved in such syntheses, the application of expert knowledge via manual curation is not feasible. Here we present a synthesis of planktonic foraminifera census counts in surface sediment samples, which is taxonomically harmonised, dereplicated and treated for numerical and other inconsistencies. The data treatment is implemented as an objective and largely automated pipeline, allowing us to reduce the initial 6,984 records to 4,205 counts from unique sites and informative technical or true replicates. We provide the final product and document the procedure, which can be easily adopted for other microfossil data syntheses.","10.1038/sdata.2017.109","2.0","Michael Siccha; Michal Kučera","2017.0","","","forcens; database; foraminifera; census; surface; sediment; samples"
"Phenotyping and Cytokine Regulation of the BEAS-2B Human Bronchial Epithelial Cell: Demonstration of Inducible Expression of the Adhesion Molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1","Airway epithelium may actively participate in inflammatory responses, such as occur in asthma. The presence and regulation of surface molecules on the airway epithelium, however, is incompletely understood. We have determined the phenotype of the human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B by flow cytometry. We confirmed previous observations that human bronchial epithelial cells constitutively express CD29, CD44, CD49a, CD49b, CD49c, CD49d, CD49e, CD49f, CD51, CD54 (ICAM-1), CD61, and HLA class 1. BEAS-2B cells were also found to constitutively express CD9, CD13, CD15, CD15s, CD23, CD33, CD36, CD40, CD41b, CD42b, CD48, CD50, CD71, and CD102 (ICAM-2). Culture of BEAS-2B cells with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or interleukin (IL)-1beta (1 ng/ml) was found to enhance intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression (several fold) and induce de novo CD106 [vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)] expression. TNF-alpha or IL-1beta did not change the expression of CD9, CD13, CD16, CD23, CD29, CD31, CD32, CD35, CD45, CD61, or CD64 in BEAS-2B cells. IL-4 (1 ng/ml) also induced expression of VCAM-1 (1.5-fold) but not ICAM- expression while interferon-gamma (1 ng/ml) enhanced only ICAM-1 expression (2-fold). Maximal VCAM-1 expression was obtained with the combination of TNF-alpha and IL-4 (8-fold). Using Northern blot hybridization analysis, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 mRNA was detected in BEAS-2B cells stimulated with cytokines. VCAM-1 on stimulated BEAS-2B was functionally active as determined by adhesion of purified eosinophils and blockade with specific antibodies. Primary isolates of bronchial epithelial cells produced detectable levels of VCAM-1 protein and mRNA as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. These results suggest that cytokine activation induces expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on airway epithelium, an event which may influence leukocyte infiltration and activation.","10.1165/ajrcmb.17.5.2685","6.0","Jun Atsuta; Sherry A.

"Using Census Data to Investigate the Causes of the Ecological Fallacy","""The authors show how data from the 2% Sample of Anonymised Records (SAR) can be combined with data from the Small Area Statistics (SAS) database to investigate the causes of the ecological fallacy in an Enumeration District (ED) level analysis. A range of census variables are examined in three ¿SAR districts'...in England. Results of comparable analyses from the 1986 Australian census are also given. The ecological fallacy arises when results from an analysis based on area-level aggregate statistics are incorrectly assumed to apply at the individual level.... A methodology is introduced which allows aggregate-level statistics to be adjusted by using individual-level information on those variables that explain much of the within-area homogeneity.""","10.1068/a300817","2.0","Mark Tranmer; David Steel","1998.0","","","census; causes; ecological; fallacy"

"THE<i>SPITZER</i><i>SPACE TELESCOPE</i>SURVEY OF THE ORION A AND B MOLECULAR CLOUDS. I. A CENSUS OF DUSTY YOUNG STELLAR OBJECTS AND A STUDY OF THEIR MID-INFRARED VARIABILITY","We present a survey of the Orion A and B molecular clouds undertaken with the IRAC and MIPS instruments onboard Spitzer. In total, five distinct fields were mapped covering 9 sq. degrees in five mid-IR bands spanning 3-24 microns. The survey includes the Orion Nebula Cluster, the Lynds 1641, 1630 and 1622 dark clouds, and the NGC 2023, 2024, 2068 and 2071 nebulae. These data are merged with the 2MASS point source catalog to generate a catalog of eight band photometry. We identify 3479 dusty young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Orion molecular clouds by searching for point sources with mid-IR colors indicative of reprocessed light from dusty disks or infalling envelopes. The YSOs are subsequently classified on the basis of their mid-IR colors and their spatial distributions are presented. We classify 2991 of the YSOs as pre-main sequence stars with disks and 488 as likely protostars. Most of the sources were observed with IRAC in 2-3 epochs over 6 months; we search for variability between the epochs by looking for correlated variability in the 3.6 and 4.5 micron bands. We find that 50% of the dusty YSOs show variability. The variations are typically small (0.2 mag.) with the protostars showing a higher incidence of variability and larger variations. The observed correlations between the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8 micron variability suggests that we are observing variations in the heating of the inner disk due to changes in the accretion luminosity or rotating accretion hot spots.","10.1088/0004-6256/144/6/192","13.0","S.

"Cyclic diquaternary ammoniums for nanocrystalline BEA, MTW and MFI zeolites with intercrystalline mesoporosity","3,10-Diazoniabicyclo[10.2.2]hexadeca-12,14,15-triene-3,3,10,10-tetramethyl-dichloride is an effective structure-directing agent for BEA zeolite under a high concentration of Na+. The pseudomorphic crystallization process led to nanocrystalline BEA particles possessing a large volume of intercrystalline mesopores. The synthesis of nanocrystalline zeolite has been extended to other cyclic diammonium compounds that can generate BEA, MTW and MFI zeolite structures. Phase diagrams for these nanocrystalline zeolites have been constructed using sodium silicate as a silica source. The nanocrystalline morphologies and intercrystalline mesoporosity have been characterized by electron microscopy and N2 adsorption. The result indicates that the pseudomorphic crystallization process is limited to BEA, and not MTW or MFI despite their nanocrystalline morphologies.","10.1039/b909792a","3.0","Kyungsu Na; Minkee Choi; Ryong Ryoo","2009.0","","","cyclic; ammoniums; bea; mtw; mfi; mesoporosity"

"Covert Communication Assisted by UAV-IRS","With the benefits of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), they can be combined to further enhance the communication performance. However, the high-quality air-ground channel is more vulnerable to the adversarial eavesdropping. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a covert communication scheme assisted by the UAV-IRS to maximize the covert transmission rate. Specifically, the ground transmitter, Alice, secretly delivers the private message to a legitimate receiver, Bob, via the UAV-IRS, wishing that the transmission will not be observable by the warden, Willie. In addition, Willie is adversarial to Alice and the UAV-IRS, which makes his accurate location difficult to obtain. Given this fact, we first determine an optimal detection threshold and derive the error detection probability at Willie, which is the worst-case situation for the legitimate transmission. Then, we maximize the covert transmission rate by alternatively optimizing the transmit power of Alice, the IRS phase shift and the horizontal location of UAV-IRS subject to the covert requirements. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed covert communication scheme assisted by UAV-IRS.","10.1109/tcomm.2022.3220903","7.0","Chao Wang; Xinying Chen; Jianping An; Zehui Xiong; Chengwen Xing; Nan Zhao; Dusit Niyato","2022.0","","","communication; assisted; uav; irs"

"Expanding the Role of Synthetic Data at the U.S. Census Bureau","National Statistical offices (NSOs) create official statistics from data collected from survey respondents, government administrative records and other sources. The raw source data is usually considered to be confidential. In the case of the U.S. Census Bureau, confidentiality of survey and administrative records microdata is mandated by statute, and this mandate to protect confidentiality is often at odds with the needs of users to extract as much information from the data as possible. Traditional disclosure protection techniques result in official data products that do not fully utilize the information content of the underlying microdata. Typically, these products take the form of simple aggregate tabulations. In a few cases anonymized public-use micro samples are made available, but these face a growing risk of re-identification by the increasing amounts of information about individuals and firms available in the public domain. One approach for overcoming these risks is to release products based on synthetic data where values are simulated from statistical models designed to mimic the (joint) distributions of the underlying microdata. We discuss recent Census Bureau work to develop and deploy such products. We discuss the benefits and challenges involved with extending the scope of synthetic data products in official statistics.","10.2139/ssrn.2408030","3.0","Ron S. Jarmin; Thomas A.

"The Greek Census Inscriptions of Late Antiquity","This article reconsiders a set of Late Roman inscriptions which record the tax liabilities of dozens of landowners in terms of post-Diocletianic fiscality. The stones, from eleven cities in the Aegean and western Asia Minor, are evaluated as evidence for the social and economic history of the Late Empire, challenging Jones' fundamental study in which the inscriptions are read as a sign of structural crisis. With their non-Egyptian provenance, the inscriptions offer unique, quantitative insights into land-ownership and labour. The inscriptions reveal surprising levels of slave labour in the eastern provinces, particularly in a new inscription from Thera. This last document allows, for the first time, an empirical analysis of the demographics of an estate-based population of slaves in antiquity.","10.3815/007543508786239661","1.0","Kyle Harper","2008.0","","","census; inscriptions; late; antiquity"

"Survey and census methods: population distribution and density","A population study of a wild primate typically involves a considerable investment of time and resources (i.e. money, equipment, labour) and it is vital to ensure that such effort is well targeted. When designing your study, a key issue is whether your study objectives genuinely demand an absolute estimate of the population density from either a census (a total count) or a survey (in which density is estimated from statistically valid samples), or whether less information will suffice. Relative estimates of density using data from methods such as 'catch per unit effort' from trapping or systematic searching do not provide absolute densities but, as long as the sampling methods and other conditions are standardized, can allow reliable comparisons between locations and monitoring of population change over time. Population indices are based on indirect indicators that can be correlated with population density, such as the density of faeces or other characteristic signs. Such methods may be a more practical alternative to searching for secretive, hard-to-find animals.","10.1017/cbo9780511921643.008","2.0","Caroline Ross; Nigel Reeve","2011.0","","","survey; census; methods; population; distribution; density"
"Accuracy assessment of MODIS, NOAA and IRS data in snow cover mapping under Himalayan conditions","Snow cover information is an essential parameter for a wide variety of scientific studies and management applications, especially in snowmelt runoff modelling. Until now NOAA and IRS data were widely and effectively used for snow‐covered area (SCA) estimation in several Himalayan basins. The suit of snow cover products produced from MODIS data had not previously been used in SCA estimation and snowmelt runoff modelling in any Himalayan basin. The present study was conducted with the aim of assessing the accuracy of MODIS, NOAA and IRS data in snow cover mapping under Himalayan conditions. The total SCA was estimated using these three datasets for 15 dates spread over 4 years. The results were compared with ground‐based estimation of snow cover. A good agreement was observed between satellite‐based estimation and ground‐based estimation. The influence of aspect in SCA estimation was analysed for the three satellite datasets and it was observed that MODIS produced better results. Snow mapping accuracy with respect to elevation was tested and it was observed that at higher elevation MODIS sensed more snow and proved better at mapping snow under mountain shadow conditions. At lower elevation, IRS proved better in mapping patchy snow cover due to higher spatial resolution. The temporal resolution of MODIS and NOAA data is better than IRS data, which means that the chances of getting cloud‐free scenes is higher. In addition, MODIS has an automated snow‐mapping algorithm, which reduces the time and errors incorporated during processing satellite data manually. Considering all these factors, it was concluded that MODIS data could be effectively used for SCA estimation under Himalayan conditions, which is a vital parameter for snowmelt runoff estimation.","10.1080/01431160801908129","3.0","Sanjay K.

"A Comprehensive Census of Microbial Diversity in Hot Springs of Tengchong, Yunnan Province China Using 16S rRNA Gene Pyrosequencing","The Rehai and Ruidian geothermal fields, located in Tengchong County, Yunnan Province, China, host a variety of geochemically distinct hot springs. In this study, we report a comprehensive, cultivation-independent census of microbial communities in 37 samples collected from these geothermal fields, encompassing sites ranging in temperature from 55.1 to 93.6°C, in pH from 2.5 to 9.4, and in mineralogy from silicates in Rehai to carbonates in Ruidian. Richness was low in all samples, with 21–123 species-level OTUs detected. The bacterial phylum Aquificae or archaeal phylum Crenarchaeota were dominant in Rehai samples, yet the dominant taxa within those phyla depended on temperature, pH, and geochemistry. Rehai springs with low pH (2.5–2.6), high temperature (85.1–89.1°C), and high sulfur contents favored the crenarchaeal order Sulfolobales, whereas those with low pH (2.6–4.8) and cooler temperature (55.1–64.5°C) favored the Aquificae genus Hydrogenobaculum. Rehai springs with neutral-alkaline pH (7.2–9.4) and high temperature (>80°C) with high concentrations of silica and salt ions (Na, K, and Cl) favored the Aquificae genus Hydrogenobacter and crenarchaeal orders Desulfurococcales and Thermoproteales. Desulfurococcales and Thermoproteales became predominant in springs with pH much higher than the optimum and even the maximum pH known for these orders. Ruidian water samples harbored a single Aquificae genus Hydrogenobacter, whereas microbial communities in Ruidian sediment samples were more diverse at the phylum level and distinctly different from those in Rehai and Ruidian water samples, with a higher abundance of uncultivated lineages, close relatives of the ammonia-oxidizing archaeon ""Candidatus Nitrosocaldus yellowstonii"", and candidate division O1aA90 and OP1. These differences between Ruidian sediments and Rehai samples were likely caused by temperature, pH, and sediment mineralogy. The results of this study significantly expand the current understanding of the microbiology in Tengchong hot springs and provide a basis for comparison with other geothermal systems around the world.","10.1371/journal.pone.0053350","17.0","Weiguo Hou; Shang Wang; Hailiang Dong; Hongchen Jiang; Brandon R.

"Multilevel Perspectives on Modeling Census Data","Since most census data are released for spatial aggregates, the microscale of people and the macroscale of places are confounded in analyses. Although regrettable, this situation is usually tolerated owing to the other obvious attractions of census data. In this paper, we consider how multilevel statistical procedures offer a solution to this problem. Importantly, we show how they allow places to be considered in terms of several different scales simultaneously. As we demonstrate, this provides important connections with recent moves towards performance review in several areas of public policy. An analysis of data on illiteracy from the 1991 Indian Census provides an illustration of multilevel approach and its usefulness.","10.1068/a3357","3.0","S. V.

"Joint Transmit and Reflective Beamforming Design for IRS-Assisted Multiuser MISO SWIPT Systems","This paper studies an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system. In this system, a multi-antenna access point (AP) uses transmit beamforming to send both information and energy signals to a set of receivers each for information decoding (ID) or energy harvesting (EH), and a dedicatedly deployed IRS properly controls its reflecting phase shifts to form passive reflection beams for facilitating both ID and EH at receivers. Under this setup, we jointly optimize the (active) information and energy transmit beamforming at the AP together with the (passive) reflective beamforming at the IRS, to maximize the minimum power received at all EH receivers, subject to individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at ID receivers, and the maximum transmit power constraint at the AP. Although the formulated SINR-constrained min-energy maximization problem is highly non-convex, we present an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution by using the techniques of alternating optimization and semi-definite relaxation (SDR). Numerical results show that the proposed IRS-assisted SWIPT system with both information and energy signals achieves significant performance gains over benchmark schemes without IRS deployed and/or without dedicated energy signals used.","10.1109/icc40277.2020.9148892","5.0","Yizheng Tang; Ganggang Ma; Hailiang Xie; Jie Xu; Xiao Han","2020.0","","","transmit; reflective; beamforming; irs; assisted; multiuser; miso; swipt; systems"

"Cancer LncRNA Census reveals evidence for deep functional conservation of long noncoding RNAs in tumorigenesis","Abstract Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a growing focus of cancer genomics studies, creating the need for a resource of lncRNAs with validated cancer roles. Furthermore, it remains debated whether mutated lncRNAs can drive tumorigenesis, and whether such functions could be conserved during evolution. Here, as part of the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium, we introduce the Cancer LncRNA Census (CLC), a compilation of 122 GENCODE lncRNAs with causal roles in cancer phenotypes. In contrast to existing databases, CLC requires strong functional or genetic evidence. CLC genes are enriched amongst driver genes predicted from somatic mutations, and display characteristic genomic features. Strikingly, CLC genes are enriched for driver mutations from unbiased, genome-wide transposon-mutagenesis screens in mice. We identified 10 tumour-causing mutations in orthologues of 8 lncRNAs, including LINC-PINT and NEAT1 , but not MALAT1 . Thus CLC represents a dataset of high-confidence cancer lncRNAs. Mutagenesis maps are a novel means for identifying deeply-conserved roles of lncRNAs in tumorigenesis.","10.1038/s42003-019-0741-7","100.0","Joana Carlevaro-Fita; Andrés Lanzós; Lars Feuerbach; Chen Hong; David Mas-Ponte; Jakob Skou Pedersen; Federico Abascal; Samirkumar B.

"Multiple Imputation of Industry and Occupation Codes in Census Public-use Samples Using Bayesian Logistic Regression","Abstract We describe methods used to create a new Census data base that can be used to study comparability of industry and occupation classification systems. This project represents the most extensive application of multiple imputation to date, and the modeling effort was considerable as well—hundreds of logistic regressions were estimated. One goal of this article is to summarize the strategies used in the project so that researchers can better understand how the new data bases were created. Another goal is to show how modifications of maximum likelihood methods were made for the modeling and imputation phases of the project. To multiply-impute 1980 census-comparable codes for industries and occupations in two 1970 census public-use samples, logistic regression models were estimated with flattening constants. For many of the regression models considered, the data were too sparse to support conventional maximum likelihood analysis, so some alternative had to be employed. These methods solve existence and related computational problems often encountered with maximum likelihood methods. Inferences pertaining to effects of predictor variables and inferences regarding predictions from logit models are also more satisfactory. The Bayesian strategy used in this project can be applied in other sparse-data settings where logistic regression is used because the approach can be implemented easily with any standard computer program for logit regression or log-linear analysis.","10.1080/01621459.1991.10475005","5.0","Clifford C.

"ALMA OBSERVATIONS OF INFALLING FLOWS TOWARD THE KEPLERIAN DISK AROUND THE CLASS I PROTOSTAR L1489 IRS","We have conducted ALMA observations in the 1.3 mm continuum and 12CO (2-1), C18O (2-1) and SO (5_6-4_5) lines toward L1489 IRS, a Class I protostar surrounded by a Keplerian disk and an infalling envelope. The Keplerian disk is clearly identified in the 12CO and C18O emission, and its outer radius (~700 AU) and mass (~0.005 Msun) are comparable to those of disks around T Tauri stars. The protostellar mass is estimated to be 1.6 Msun with the inclination angle of 66 deg. In addition to the Keplerian disk, there are blueshifted and redshifted off-axis protrusions seen in the C18O emission pointing toward the north and the south, respectively, adjunct to the middle part of the Keplerian disk. The shape and kinematics of these protrusions can be interpreted as streams of infalling flows with a conserved angular momentum following parabolic trajectories toward the Keplerian disk, and the mass infalling rate is estimated to be ~5E-7 Msun/yr. The specific angular momentum of the infalling flows (~2.5E-3 km/s*pc) is comparable to that at the outer radius of the Keplerian disk (~4.8E-3 km/s*pc). The SO emission is elongated along the disk major axis and exhibits a linear velocity gradient along the axis, which is interpreted as that the SO emission primarily traces a ring region in the flared Keplerian disk at radii of ~250-390 AU. The local enhancement of the SO abundance in the ring region can be due to the accretion shocks at the centrifugal radius where the infalling flows fall onto the disk. Our ALMA observations unveiled both the Keplerian disk and the infalling gas onto the disk, and the disk can further grow by accreting material and angular momenta from the infalling gas.","10.1088/0004-637x/793/1/1","11.0","Hsi-Wei Yen; Shigehisa Takakuwa; Nagayoshi Ohashi; Yuri Aikawa; Yusuke Aso; Shin Koyamatsu; Masahiro N.

"Infrared [ITAL]L[/ITAL]-Band Observations of the Trapezium Cluster: A Census of Circumstellar Disks and Candidate Protostars","We report the results of a sensitive near-infrared JHKL imaging survey of the Trapezium cluster in Orion. We use the JHKL colors to obtain a census of infrared excess stars in the cluster. Of (391) stars brighter than 12th magnitude in the K and L bands, 80% ± 7% are found to exhibit detectable infrared excess on the J-H, K-L color-color diagram. Examination of a subsample of 285 of these stars with published spectral types yields a slightly higher infrared excess fraction of 85%. We find that 97% of the optical proplyds in the cluster exhibit excess in the JHKL color-color diagram indicating that the most likely origin of the observed infrared excesses is from circumstellar disks. We interpret these results to indicate that the fraction of stars in the cluster with circumstellar disks is between 80%–85%, confirming earlier published suggestions of a high disk fraction for this young cluster. Moreover, we find that the probability of finding an infrared excess around a star is independent of stellar mass over essentially the entire range of the stellar mass function down to the hydrogen burning limit. Consequently, the vast majority of stars in the Trapezium cluster appear to have been born with circumstellar disks and the potential to subsequently form planetary systems, despite formation within the environment of a rich and dense stellar cluster. We identify 78 stars in our sample characterized by K-L colors suggestive of deeply embedded objects. The spatial distribution of these objects differs from that of the rest of the cluster members and is similar to that of the dense molecular cloud ridge behind the cluster. About half of these objects are detected in the short wavelength (J and H) bands, and these are found to be characterized by extreme infrared excess. This suggests that many of these sources could be protostellar in nature. If even a modest fraction (i.e., ∼50%) of these objects are protostars, then star formation could be continuing in the molecular ridge at a rate comparable to that which produced the foreground Trapezium cluster.","10.1086/316848","7.0","C.

"Long-term census data reveal abundant wildlife populations at Chernobyl","SummaryFollowing the 1986 Chernobyl accident, 116,000 people were permanently evacuated from the 4,200 km2 Chernobyl exclusion zone [1]. There is continuing scientific and public debate surrounding the fate of wildlife that remained in the abandoned area. Several previous studies of the Chernobyl exclusion zone (e.g. [2,3]) indicated major radiation effects and pronounced reductions in wildlife populations at dose rates well below those thought [4,5] to cause significant impacts. In contrast, our long-term empirical data showed no evidence of a negative influence of radiation on mammal abundance. Relative abundances of elk, roe deer, red deer and wild boar within the Chernobyl exclusion zone are similar to those in four (uncontaminated) nature reserves in the region and wolf abundance is more than 7 times higher. Additionally, our earlier helicopter survey data show rising trends in elk, roe deer and wild boar abundances from one to ten years post-accident. These results demonstrate for the first time that, regardless of potential radiation effects on individual animals, the Chernobyl exclusion zone supports an abundant mammal community after nearly three decades of chronic radiation exposures.","10.1016/j.cub.2015.08.017","7.0","T.G.

"Counting Species: Biopower and the Global Biodiversity Census","Biopolitical analyses of census-taking usually focus on human censuses and consider how human experience is shaped by the practice. Instead, this article looks at the proposed global biodiversity census, which aims to take inventory of every species on earth as a response to anthropogenic species extinction. I suggest that it is possible to extend and modify Foucault's concept of biopower to consider contemporary human-nonhuman interactions. Specifically, I argue that an ecologically-extended version of biopower offers a useful way to conceptualise how power circulates in the practices that surround the biodiversity census, and that it points us towards thinking about how analyses of power, authority, and community can consider ecological, rather than purely human, locations and networks.","10.3197/096327108x343149","1.0","Rafi Youatt","2008.0","","","species; biopower; biodiversity; census"
"Mexican Immigration and Self-Selection: New Evidence from the 2000 Mexican Census","We use data from the 2000 Mexican Census to examine how the education and socioeconomic status of Mexican immigrants to the United States compares to that of non-migrants in Mexico.Our primary conclusion is that migrants tend to be less educated than non-migrants.This finding is consistent with the idea that the return to education is higher in Mexico than in the United States, and thus the wage gain to migrating is proportionately smaller for high-educated Mexicans than it is for lower-educated Mexicans.We also find that the degree of negative selection of migrants is stronger in Mexican counties that have a higher return to education.","10.3386/w11456","2.0","Pablo Ibarrarán; Darren Lubotsky","2005.0","","","immigration; self; selection; new; evidence; mexican; census"
"Elucidating the Roles of Zeolite H-BEA in Aqueous-Phase Fructose Dehydration and HMF Rehydration","The main paths by which zeolites carry out the dehydration of fructose to HMF and the rehydration of HMF to levulinic acid in aqueous solutions are elucidated using an H-BEA zeolite with SiO2/Al2O3 = 18 (H-BEA-18) as a representative solid acid catalyst. Specifically, the relative role of homogeneous chemistry (both solvent- and zeolite-induced), the effect of external surface acid sites, and the effect of adsorption of products and reactants on the catalyst for these reactions is delineated. We found that H-BEA-18 increases the conversion of fructose and HMF in part by catalyzing fructose isomerization to glucose and HMF rehydration to formic and levulinic acids, respectively. The glucose-to-fructose isomerization is caused by octahedral aluminum atoms that act as Lewis acid sites as shown by 1H and 13C NMR. These Lewis sites are formed during calcination and are stable under reaction conditions. They also catalyze reactions to unknown products from both fructose and HMF. The acids produced from HMF rehydration dissolve aluminosilicate species from the zeolite, which also catalyze some of the undesired side reactions. We show that the decrease of the initial pH due to the addition of the zeolite and the catalysis by sites on the external surface of the zeolite have a negligible contribution to the chemistry under most conditions investigated. H-BEA-18 more readily converts HMF than fructose, due to strong preferential adsorption of HMF, furfural, and levulinic acid compared to sugars. Under mildly acidic conditions (without the addition of inorganic acids) that are environmentally preferred, zeolites can increase the conversion of HMF and the selectivity to levulinic acid many-fold. This provides an indication that heterogeneous materials may be superior in the production of levulinic acid from HMF.","10.1021/cs4002157","4.0","Jacob S.

"A national census of medicines use: a 24‐hour snapshot of Australians aged 50 years and older","Objective: To explore the current use of conventional and complementary medicines in Australians aged ≥ 50 years. Design, setting and participants: Cross-sectional postal survey sent to a random sample of 4500 Australians aged ≥ 50 years between June 2009 and February 2010. Main outcome measures: Prevalence of medicines use, reasons for medicines use and sources of medicines. Results: Response rate was 37.3%. Medicines use was very common; 87.1% of participants took one or more medicines and 43.3% took five or more in the previous 24 hours. Complementary medicines were used by 46.3% of participants, 87.4% of whom used both conventional and complementary medicines. The most commonly used medicines were antihypertensive agents (43.2% of participants), natural marine and animal products including fish oil and glucosamine (32.4%) and lipid-lowering agents (30.4%). Doctors recommended 79.3% of all medicines and 93.0% of conventional medicines. Pharmacists commonly recommended occasional medicines (ie, as needed), while friends, family and media most often influenced use of complementary medicines. Conclusions: The use of multiple medicines is common and higher than reported in the 1995 National Health Survey. Today, much medicines use is to prevent future disease by influencing risk factors. High levels of polypharmacy highlight the need to support the safe and effective use of medicines in the community. Although doctors recommend or prescribe most medicines, self-directed medication use is common. This highlights the need for consumer access to accurate information and strategies to improve health literacy about medicines.","10.5694/mja11.10698","6.0","Tessa Morgan; Margaret Williamson; Marie Pirotta; Kay Stewart; Stephen P Myers; Joanne Barnes","2012.0","","","census; medicines; hour; snapshot; australians; years"

"The Census Bureau on Prospects for US Population Growth in the Twenty‐First Century","The U.S. Census Bureau periodically releases projections of the US resident population, detailed by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. The most recent of these, issued 13 January 2000, for the first time extend to the year 2100 and also include information on the foreign‐bom population. (Earlier projections were carried up to 2080.) The extensive tabulations presenting the new set, and detailed explanation of the methodology and the assumptions underlying the projections, are accessible at the Census Bureau's web site: http://www.census.gov . A brief summary of some of the main results of these projections is reproduced below from United States Department of Commerce News , Washington, DC 20230. (The Census Bureau is an agency of the Department of Commerce.) Uncertainties as to future trends in fertility, mortality, and net migration over a period of some 100 years are very great, as is illustrated by the massive difference in the projected size of the population for 2100 in the three variants produced. The “middle” projected population figure of 571 million (which represents a growth of some 109 percent over its current level) is bracketed by “lowest” and “highest” alternative projections of 283 million and 1.18 billion, respectively. With somewhat lesser force, the point also applies to the 50‐year time span considered in the well‐known country‐by‐country projections of the United Nations. These projections are also detailed in three variants: low, middle, and high. The UN projections (last revised in 1998) envisage less rapid growth in the United States during the first part of the twenty‐first century than do the Census Bureau's. The projected population figures for 2050 in the three variants (low, middle, and high) are as follows (in millions): U.S. Census Bureau 313.5 403.7 552.8 United Nations 292.8 349.3 419.0 Since the initial age and sex distributions from which the two sets of population projections start are essentially identical, these differences reflect assumptions by the Census Bureau with respect to the three factors affecting population dynamics in the next 50 years. In the middle series, each of these assumptions is more growth‐producing in the Census Bureau's set than in that of the United Nations. Thus, in the middle of the twenty‐first century the Census Bureau anticipates male and female life expectancies of 81.2 and 86.7 years; the corresponding figures according to the UN are 78.8 and 84.4 years. Net immigration to the United States per 1000 population at midcentury is assumed to be 2.2 by the United Nations and somewhat above 2.4 according to the Census Bureau. The factor most affecting the difference between the projected population sizes, however, is the differing assumptions with respect to fertility. The middle UN series anticipates a midcentury US total fertility rate of 1.9 children per woman; the Census Bureau's assumption is slightly above 2.2. A notable feature of the Census Bureau's projection methodology in comparison to that of the UN is the recognition of differences in mortality and fertility, and also in immigration, with respect to race and Hispanic origin. Thus, at midcentury the white non‐Hispanic population is assumed to have a total fertility rate of 2.03; the corresponding figure for the population of Hispanic origin is 2.56. (Fertility in other population subgroups is expected to lie between these values, although closer to the fertility of non‐Hispanic whites.) And Hispanic immigration, currently the major component within total immigration, is assumed to remain significant throughout the next five decades (although by midcentury it is expected to be far exceeded by immigration of non‐Hispanic Asians). As a result, the structure of the US population by race and Hispanic origin is expected to shift markedly. To the extent that fertility and mortality differentials persist, such a shift also affects the mean fertility and mortality figures of the total population.","10.1111/j.1728-4457.2000.00197.x","0.0","","2000.0","Washington","","census; bureau; prospects; us; population; growth; twenty; first; century"

"New global seamount census from altimetry-derived gravity data","Recent revisions to the satellite-derived vertical gravity gradient (VGG) data reveal more detail of the ocean bottom and have allowed us to develop a non-linear inversion method to detect seamounts in VGG data. We approximate VGG anomalies over seamounts as sums of individual, partially overlapping, elliptical polynomial functions, which allows us to form a non-linear inverse problem by fitting the polynomial model to the observations. Model parameters for a potential seamount include geographical location, peak VGG amplitude, major and minor axes of the elliptical base, and the azimuth of the major axis. The non-linear inversion is very sensitive to the initial values for the location and amplitude; hence, they are constrained by the centre and amplitude of the uppermost contours obtained with a 1-Eötvös contour interval. With these initial conditions from contouring, we execute a step-wise and fully automated inversion and obtain optimal model estimates for potential seamounts; these are statistically evaluated for significance using the Akaike Information Criterion and F tests. A logarithmic barrier technique is applied to ensure positivity of all seamount amplitudes. After automatic and manual inspections of the model parameters we estimate actual heights and basal ellipses of the inspected potential seamounts directly from the predicted bathymetry grid. In this study, we find globally 24 643 potential seamounts (h ≥ 0.1 km) that are located away from continental margins; 8458 potential seamounts are taller than 1 km. Although our global estimate is significantly lower than predictions from previous studies, a first-order reconciliation of the size-frequency statistics obtained from those studies reveals that the previous counts are systematically overestimated. Because of the ambiguity of gravity signals due to small seamounts of h < 1 km and the overlap with abyssal hills, we estimate the global seamount census to lie in the 40 000–55 000 range. The seamount data from this study are accessible from http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/PT/SMTS.","10.1111/j.1365-246x.2011.05076.x","2.0","Seung‐Sep Kim; Paul Wessel","2011.0","","","new; seamount; census; altimetry; gravity"
"Population Census of a Large Common Tern Colony with a Small Unmanned Aircraft","Small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) may be useful for conducting high-precision, low-disturbance waterbird surveys, but limited data exist on their effectiveness. We evaluated the capacity of a small UAS to census a large (>6,000 nests) coastal Common tern (Sterna hirundo) colony of which ground surveys are particularly disruptive and time-consuming. We compared aerial photographic tern counts to ground nest counts in 45 plots (5-m radius) throughout the colony at three intervals over a nine-day period in order to identify sources of variation and establish a coefficient to estimate nest numbers from UAS surveys. We also compared a full colony ground count to full counts from two UAS surveys conducted the following day. Finally, we compared colony disturbance levels over the course of UAS flights to matched control periods. Linear regressions between aerial and ground counts in plots had very strong correlations in all three comparison periods (R2 = 0.972-0.989, P < 0.001) and regression coefficients ranged from 0.928-0.977 terns/nest. Full colony aerial counts were 93.6% and 94.0%, respectively, of the ground count. Varying visibility of terns with ground cover, weather conditions and image quality, and changing nest attendance rates throughout incubation were likely sources of variation in aerial detection rates. Optimally timed UAS surveys of Common tern colonies following our method should yield population estimates in the 93-96% range of ground counts. Although the terns were initially disturbed by the UAS flying overhead, they rapidly habituated to it. Overall, we found no evidence of sustained disturbance to the colony by the UAS. We encourage colonial waterbird researchers and managers to consider taking advantage of this burgeoning technology.","10.1371/journal.pone.0122588","3.0","Dominique Chabot; Shawn R. Craik; David M.

"Generation and Characterization of Well-Defined Zn<sup>2+</sup> Lewis Acid Sites in Ion Exchanged Zeolite BEA","Bifunctional, Lewis, and Brønsted acidic molecular sieves were prepared by stepwise zinc ion exchange of zeolite BEA. The relation between the location of the Zn2+ cations in the zeolite structure and the Lewis acidity of the metal cations was explored. Several techniques were used for the detailed characterization of the material, including IR spectroscopy, with pyridine and acetonitrile as probe molecules, temperature programmed desorption, with ammonia and 2-propylamine as probe molecules, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and 27Al MAS and MQMAS NMR spectroscopy. At low zinc concentrations (<0.15 Zn/Al) the cations are preferentially incorporated in the vicinity of two framework aluminum atoms. With increasing zinc loading (0.15 ≤ Zn/Al ≤ 0.26), additional cation sites are created at nearby framework aluminum pairs with two zinc cations being bridged by an oxygen atom. At higher zinc loading (0.26 < Zn/Al < 0.77) zinc oxide is formed in addition to the other two Zn2+ species.","10.1021/jp0373043","7.0","Jochen Penzien; Anuji Abraham; Jeroen A. van Bokhoven; Andreas Jentys; Thomas E.

"A structural census of the current population of protein sequences","We examine the occurrence of the approximately 300 known protein folds in different groups of organisms. To do this, we characterize a large fraction of the currently known protein sequences ( approximately 140,000) in structural terms, by matching them to known structures via sequence comparison (or by secondary-structure class prediction for those without structural homologues). Overall, we find that an appreciable fraction of the known folds are present in each of the major groups of organisms (e.g., bacteria and eukaryotes share 156 of 275 folds), and most of the common folds are associated with many families of nonhomologous sequences (i.e., >10 sequence families for each common fold). However, different groups of organisms have characteristically distinct distributions of folds. So, for instance, some of the most common folds in vertebrates, such as globins or zinc fingers, are rare or absent in bacteria. Many of these differences in fold usage are biologically reasonable, such as the folds of metabolic enzymes being common in bacteria and those associated with extracellular transport and communication being common in animals. They also have important implications for database-based methods for fold recognition, suggesting that an unknown sequence from a plant is more likely to have a certain fold (e.g., a TIM barrel) than an unknown sequence from an animal.","10.1073/pnas.94.22.11911","2.0","Mark Gerstein; Michael Levitt","1997.0","","","census; population; protein; sequences"

"O-GlcNAc modification on IRS-1 and Akt2 by PUGNAc inhibits their phosphorylation and induces insulin resistance in rat primary adipocytes","It has been known that O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification of proteins plays an important role in transcription, translation, nuclear transport and signal transduction. The increased flux of glucose through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) and increased O-GlcNAc modification of protein have been suggested as one of the causes in the development of insulin resistance. However, it is not clear at the molecular level, how O-GlcNAc protein modification results in substantial impairment of insulin signaling. To clarify the association of O-GlcNAc protein modification and insulin resistance in rat primary adipocytes, we treated the adipocytes with O-(2-acetamido-2deoxy-D-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc), a potent inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase that catalyzes removal of O-GlcNAc from proteins. Prolonged treatment of PUGNAc (100 µM for 12 h) increased O-GlcNAc modification on proteins in adipocytes. PUGNAc also drastically decreased insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) uptake and GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes, indicating that PUGNAc developed impaired glucose utilization and insulin resistance in adipocytes. Interestingly, the O-GlcNAc modification of IRS-1 and Akt2 was increased by PUGNAc, accompanied by a partial reduction of insulin-stimulated phosphorylations of IRS-1 and Akt2. The PUGNAc treatment has no effect on the expression level of GLUT4, whereas O-GlcNAc modification of GLUT4 was increased. These results suggest that the increase of O-GlcNAc modification on insulin signal pathway intermediates, such as IRS-1 and Akt2, reduces the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Akt2, subsequently leading to insulin resistance in rat primary adipocytes.","10.1038/emm.2005.30","3.0","Seung Yoon Park; Jiwon Ryu; Wan Lee","2005.0","","","o; glcnac; modification; irs; akt; pugnac; inhibits; phosphorylation; induces; resistance; rat; adipocytes"

We also show that top-coding artificially moves the correlation between two variables (at least one of which is top-coded) closer to zero by the transformation. We then discuss our attempts to recover the un-transformed data, or at least the original correlations, which all failed. In the final section we briefly discuss methods of disclosure avoidance in PUMS files which preserve joint probability distributions.","10.29012/jpc.v6i2.639","2.0","Nicole Crimi; William Eddy","2014.0","","","coding; public; microdata; samples; u; s; census; bureau"
"Do IRS Audits Deter Corporate Tax Avoidance?","We extend research on the determinants of corporate tax avoidance to include the role of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) monitoring. Our evidence from large samples implies that U.S. public firms undertake less aggressive tax positions when tax enforcement is stricter. Reflecting its first-order economic impact on firms, our coefficient estimates imply that raising the probability of an IRS audit from 19 percent (the 25th percentile in our data) to 37 percent (the 75th percentile) increases their cash effective tax rates, on average, by nearly 2 percentage points, which amounts to a 7 percent increase in cash effective tax rates. These results are robust to controlling for firm size and time, which determine our primary proxy for IRS enforcement, in different ways; specifying several alternative dependent and test variables; and confronting potential endogeneity with instrumental variables and panel data estimations, among other techniques.","10.2139/ssrn.1668628","3.0","Jeffrey L.

"Comparing Chemistry and Census-Based Estimates of Net Ecosystem Calcification on a Rim Reef in Bermuda","Coral reef net ecosystem calcification (NEC) has decreased for many Caribbean reefs over recent decades primarily due to a combination of declining coral cover and changing benthic community composition. Chemistry-based approaches to calculate NEC utilize the drawdown of seawater total alkalinity (TA) combined with residence time to calculate an instantaneous measurement of NEC. Census-based approaches combine annual growth rates with benthic cover and reef structural complexity to estimate NEC occurring over annual timescales. Here, NEC was calculated for Hog Reef in Bermuda using both chemistry and census-based NEC techniques to compare the mass-balance generated by the two methods and identify the dominant biocalcifiers at Hog Reef. Our findings indicate close agreement between the annual 2011 census-based NEC 2.35±1.01 kg CaCO3•m-2•y-1 and the chemistry-based NEC 2.23±1.02 kg CaCO3•m-2•y-1 at Hog Reef. An additional record of Hog Reef TA data calculated from an autonomous CO2 mooring measuring pCO2 and modeled pHtotal every 3-hours highlights the dynamic temporal variability in coral reef NEC. This ability for chemistry-based NEC techniques to capture higher frequency variability in coral reef NEC allows the mechanisms driving NEC variability to be explored and tested. Just four coral species, Diploria labyrinthiformis, Pseudodiploria strigosa, Millepora alcicornis, and Orbicella franksi, were identified by the census-based NEC as contributing to 94±19% of the total calcium carbonate production at Hog Reef suggesting these species should be highlighted for conservation to preserve current calcium carbonate production rates at Hog Reef. As coral cover continues to decline globally, the agreement between these NEC estimates suggest that either method, but ideally both methods, may serve as a useful tool for coral reef managers and conservation scientists to monitor the maintenance of coral reef structure and ecosystem services.","10.3389/fmars.2016.00181","16.0","Travis A.

"The Fyn Tyrosine Kinase Binds Irs-1 and Forms a Distinct Signaling Complex during Insulin Stimulation","Irs-proteins link the receptors for insulin/IGF-1, growth hormones, and several interleukins and interferons to signaling proteins that contain Src homology-2 (SH2). To identify new Irs-1-binding proteins, we screened a mouse embryo expression library with recombinant [32P]Irs-1, which revealed a specific association between p59fyn and Irs-1. The SH2 domain in p59fyn bound to phosphorylated Tyr895 and Tyr1172, which are located in YXX(L/I) motifs. Mutation of p59fyn at the COOH-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation site (Tyr531) enhanced its binding to Irs-1 during insulin stimulation. Binding experiments with various SH2 proteins revealed that Grb-2 was largely excluded from Irs-1 complexes containing p59fyn, whereas Grb-2 and p85 occurred in the same Irs-1 complex. By comparison with the insulin receptor, p59fynkinase phosphorylated a unique cohort of tyrosine residues in Irs-1. These results outline a role for p59fyn or other related Src-kinases during insulin and cytokine signaling.

"Improving the open cluster census","Context. The census of open clusters in the Milky Way is in a never-before seen state of flux. Recent works have reported hundreds of new open clusters thanks to the incredible astrometric quality of the Gaia satellite, but other works have also reported that many open clusters discovered in the pre Gaia era may be associations. Aims. We aim to conduct a comparison of clustering algorithms used to detect open clusters, attempting to statistically quantify their strengths and weaknesses by deriving the sensitivity, specificity, and precision of each as well as their true positive rate against a larger sample. Methods. We selected DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, and Gaussian mixture models for further study, owing to their speed and appropriateness for use with Gaia data. We developed a preprocessing pipeline for Gaia data and developed the algorithms further for the specific application to open clusters. We derived detection rates for all 1385 open clusters in the fields in our study as well as more detailed performance statistics for 100 of these open clusters. Results. DBSCAN was sensitive to 50%–62% of the true positive open clusters in our sample, with generally very good specificity and precision. HDBSCAN traded precision for a higher sensitivity of up to 82%, especially across different distances and scales of open clusters. Gaussian mixture models were slow and only sensitive to 33% of open clusters in our sample, which tended to be larger objects. Additionally, we report on 41 new open cluster candidates detected by HDBSCAN, three of which are closer than 500 pc. Conclusions. When used with additional post-processing to mitigate its false positives, we have found that HDBSCAN is the most sensitive and effective algorithm for recovering open clusters in Gaia data.

"Beamforming and Jamming Optimization for IRS-Aided Secure NOMA Networks","The integration of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and multiple access provides a promising solution to improved coverage and massive connections at low cost. However, securing IRS-aided networks remains a challenge since the potential eavesdropper also has access to an additional IRS reflection link, especially when the eavesdropping channel state information is unknown. In this paper, we propose an IRS-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme to achieve secure communication via artificial jamming, where the multi-antenna base station sends the NOMA and jamming signals together to the legitimate users with the assistance of IRS, in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. The sum rate of legitimate users is maximized by optimizing the transmit beamforming, the jamming vector and the IRS reflecting vector, satisfying the quality of service requirement, the IRS reflecting constraint and the successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding condition. In addition, the received jamming power is adapted at the highest level at all legitimate users for successful cancellation via SIC. To tackle this non-convex optimization problem, we first decompose it into two subproblems, and then each subproblem is converted into a convex one using successive convex approximation. An alternate optimization algorithm is proposed to solve them iteratively. Numerical results show that the secure transmission in the proposed IRS-NOMA scheme can be effectively guaranteed with the assistance of artificial jamming.","10.1109/twc.2021.3104856","7.0","Wei Wang; Xin Liu; Jie Tang; Nan Zhao; Yunfei Chen; Zhiguo Ding; Xianbin Wang","2021.0","","","beamforming; jamming; optimization; irs; aided; secure; noma; networks"
"Interpreting ""Nationality"" and ""Language"" in the 2001 Ukrainian Census","Ukraine conducted its first post-Soviet census in December 2001. The author examines the use of the categories ""nationality"" and ""native language"" in the census and relates them to fundamental precepts of Soviet nationality and census policies. The enumeration of national and linguistic identities is related to the expression of political preferences. Orientations toward language policies (particularly in Galicia and Crimea), regional autonomy (in Transcarpathia), and territorial belonging (among the younger generation) are analyzed in order to reveal the politics of the 2001 Ukrainian census.","10.2747/1060-586x.18.3.213","1.0","Dominique Arel","2002.0","","","nationality; language; census"
"The 2005 census and mapping of slums in Bangladesh: design, select results and application","Abstract Background The concentration of poverty and adverse environmental circumstances within slums, particularly those in the cities of developing countries, are an increasingly important concern for both public health policy initiatives and related programs in other sectors. However, there is a dearth of information on the population-level implications of slum life for human health. This manuscript describes the 2005 Census and Mapping of Slums (CMS), which used geographic information systems (GIS) tools and digital satellite imagery combined with more traditional fieldwork methodologies, to obtain detailed, up-to-date and new information about slum life in all slums of six major cities in Bangladesh (including Dhaka). Results The CMS found that Bangladeshi slums are very diverse: there are wide intra- and inter-city variations in population size, density, the percent of urban populations living in slums, and sanitation conditions. Findings also show that common beliefs about slums may be outdated; of note , tenure insecurity was found to be an issue in only a small minority of slums. Conclusion The methodology used in the 2005 Bangladesh CMS provides a useful approach to mapping slums that could be applied to urban areas in other low income societies. This methodology may become an increasingly important analytic tool to inform policy, as cities in developing countries are forecasted to continue increasing their share of total global population in the coming years, with slum populations more than doubling in size during the same period.","10.1186/1476-072x-8-32","6.0","Gustavo Ángeles; Peter Lance; Janine Barden-O’Fallon; Nazrul Islam; A.

"Who Are the Whites?: Imposed Census Categories and the Racial Demography of Brazil","This article presents the results of an experiment carried out in Brazil to test the consequences of ignoring or overriding the distinctive features of the cognitive system by which Brazilians express their “race-color” identities.{su1} The experiment consisted of substituting a salient vernacular term (morena) for the seldom-used term (parda) that the Brazilian census offers as self-identification for a person who has both black and white color-race features. When morena is offered in a split census, the proportion of respondents who self-identify as being of mixed color-race substantially increases while the proportion identifying as white or black substantially declines. These findings expose the error of imposing upon the rest of the hemisphere rigid dichotomous (white/non-white) or trichotomous (white/mixed/black) categories deemed appropriate for establishing racial identity in the U.S.","10.1093/sf/72.2.451","4.0","Marvin Harris; Josildeth Gomes Consorte; Jason E.

"Vegetation and songbird response to land abandonment: from landscape to census plot","ABSTRACT While intensification of human activities and its ecological effects in many natural areas have recently received much attention, land abandonment in marginal areas is still the largely ignored side of a process rooted in the same socioeconomic context. Decreasing human impact in marginal rural areas often triggers a recovery of seminatural vegetation. Over a period of 25 years, we studied the changes in landscape and vegetation structure that followed land abandonment in a traditional Mediterranean mosaic of crops, grasslands, shrublands and woodlands, and assessed their effects on songbird occurrence and distribution. We combined an analysis of vegetation changes based on aerial photo interpretation with an analysis of bird censuses from 1978, 1992 and 2003 at two spatial scales: landscape and census plot (respectively 2800 and 3 ha). The perceived temporal changes in the vegetation were scale dependent. At the landscape scale, open habitats tended to disappear and woodlands matured. The contrasts in vegetation structure that defined habitat patches at the onset of the study tended to disappear. There was an overall shift of the bird community in favour of woodland species. At the scale of the census plot, however, the colonization by woody vegetation of patches formerly characterized by a homogeneous grass cover increased the local diversity of the vegetation, at least temporarily. Of seven species dependent on open habitats, the occurrence rate of five species significantly decreased, whereas it increased for two species: woodlark ( Lulula arborea ) and melodious warbler ( Hippolais polyglotta ). This increase was linked to the transitional increase in local vegetation diversity. In patches originally dominated by woodlands, local vegetation diversity decreased as woody vegetation expanded into clearings. The occurrence rate significantly increased for seven species relying on closed woodlands, while it decreased for two woodland species. As most species of high conservation profile in the Mediterranean are tied to open or to heterogeneous transitional habitats, these trends raise questions concerning their persistence in the future.","10.1111/j.1472-4642.2006.00297.x","3.0","Clélia Sirami; Lluı́s Brotons; Jean‐Louis Martin","2006.0","","","vegetation; response; abandonment; landscape; plot"
"Estimating the Density of Honeybee Colonies across Their Natural Range to Fill the Gap in Pollinator Decline Censuses","Abstract: Although pollinator declines are a global biodiversity threat, the demography of the western honeybee ( Apis mellifera ) has not been considered by conservationists because it is biased by the activity of beekeepers. To fill this gap in pollinator decline censuses and to provide a broad picture of the current status of honeybees across their natural range, we used microsatellite genetic markers to estimate colony densities and genetic diversity at different locations in Europe, Africa, and central Asia that had different patterns of land use. Genetic diversity and colony densities were highest in South Africa and lowest in Northern Europe and were correlated with mean annual temperature. Confounding factors not related to climate, however, are also likely to influence genetic diversity and colony densities in honeybee populations. Land use showed a significantly negative influence over genetic diversity and the density of honeybee colonies over all sampling locations. In Europe honeybees sampled in nature reserves had genetic diversity and colony densities similar to those sampled in agricultural landscapes, which suggests that the former are not wild but may have come from managed hives. Other results also support this idea: putative wild bees were rare in our European samples, and the mean estimated density of honeybee colonies on the continent closely resembled the reported mean number of managed hives. Current densities of European honeybee populations are in the same range as those found in the adverse climatic conditions of the Kalahari and Saharan deserts, which suggests that beekeeping activities do not compensate for the loss of wild colonies. Our findings highlight the importance of reconsidering the conservation status of honeybees in Europe and of regarding beekeeping not only as a profitable business for producing honey, but also as an essential component of biodiversity conservation.","10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01331.x","15.0","Rodolfo Jaffé; Vincent Dietemann; Mike Allsopp; Cecília Costa; Robin M.

"Hydrothermal Stability of Fe–BEA as an NH<sub>3</sub>-SCR Catalyst","The hydrothermal stability of Fe–BEA as a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst was experimentally studied. Cordierite supported Fe–BEA samples were hydrothermally treated at 600 and 700 °C for 3–100 h to capture the effect of aging time and temperature. Before and after aging the samples were characterized with BET, XPS, XRD, and NH3-TPD. The catalytic performance of the samples with respect to NO oxidation, NH3 oxidation, and NO reduction (NH3-SCR) was studied by flow reactor experiments to correlate changes of the catalytic performance with structural changes of the zeolite and the iron phases. The NH3-SCR experiments did not show any significant decrease in activity after a short time of aging (3 h at 700 °C) even though the ammonia storage capacity decreased by 40% and the oxidation state of iron slightly increased. A longer time of aging resulted in decreased activity for NO reduction during low temperatures (150–300 °C), while at higher temperatures (400–500 °C) the activity remained high. The results indicate that the NO reduction is more sensitive at low temperatures to changes in the oxidation state of iron caused by hydrothermal aging than at higher temperatures. Furthermore, a maximum in activity for NO oxidation and increased oxidation state of iron (Fe3+) indicate Fe2O3 particle growth.","10.1021/ie301516z","6.0","Soran Shwan; Radka Nedyalkova; Jonas Jansson; John Korsgren; Louise Olsson; Magnus Skoglundh","2012.0","","","hydrothermal; stability; fe; bea; nh; sub; scr; catalyst"
"A Shallow Cumuliform Snowfall Census Using Spaceborne Radar","Abstract The first observationally based near-global shallow cumuliform snowfall census is undertaken using multiyear CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar observations. CloudSat snowfall observations and snowfall rate estimates from the CloudSat 2C-Snow Water Content and Snowfall Rate (2C-SNOW-PROFILE) product are partitioned between shallow cumuliform and nimbostratus cloud structures by utilizing coincident cloud category classifications from the CloudSat 2B-Cloud Scenario Classification (2B-CLDCLASS) product. Shallow cumuliform (nimbostratus) snowfall events comprise about 36% (59%) of snowfall events in the CloudSat snowfall dataset. The remaining 5% of snowfall events are distributed between other categories. Distinct oceanic versus continental trends exist between the two major snowfall categories, as shallow cumuliform snow-producing clouds occur predominantly over the oceans. Regional differences are also noted in the partitioned dataset, with over-ocean regions near Greenland, the far North Atlantic Ocean, the Barents Sea, the western Pacific Ocean, the southern Bering Sea, and the Southern Hemispheric pan-oceanic region containing distinct shallow snowfall occurrence maxima exceeding 60%. Certain Northern Hemispheric continental regions also experience frequent shallow cumuliform snowfall events (e.g., inland Russia), as well as some mountainous regions. CloudSat -generated snowfall rates are also partitioned between the two major snowfall categories to illustrate the importance of shallow snow-producing cloud structures to the average annual snowfall. While shallow cumuliform snowfall produces over 50% of the annual estimated surface snowfall flux regionally, about 18% (82%) of global snowfall is attributed to shallow (nimbostratus) snowfall. This foundational spaceborne snowfall study will be utilized for follow-on evaluative studies with independent model, reanalysis, and ground-based observational datasets to characterize respective dataset biases and to better quantify CloudSat snowfall detection and quantitative snowfall estimate uncertainties.","10.1175/jhm-d-15-0123.1","6.0","Mark S.

"<i>Spitzer</i>Observations of the Orion OB1 Association: Disk Census in the Low‐Mass Stars","We present new Spitzer Space Telescope observations of two fields in the Orion OB1 association. We report here IRAC/MIPS observations for 115 confirmed members and 41 photometric candidates of the ~10 Myr 25 Orionis aggregate in the OB1a subassociation, and 106 confirmed members and 65 photometric candidates of the 5 Myr region located in the OB1b subassociation. The 25 Orionis aggregate shows a disk frequency of 6% while the field in the OB1b subassociation shows a disk frequency of 13%. Combining IRAC, MIPS and 2MASS photometry we place stars bearing disks in several classes: stars with optically thick disks (class II systems), stars with an inner transitional disks (transitional disk candidates) and stars with ""evolved disks""; the last exhibit smaller IRAC/MIPS excesses than class II systems. In all, we identify 1 transitional disk candidate in the 25 Orionis aggregate and 3 in the OB1b field; this represents ~10% of the disk bearing stars, indicating that the transitional disk phase can be relatively fast. We find that the frequency of disks is a function of the stellar mass, suggesting a maximum around stars with spectral type M0. Comparing the infrared excess in the IRAC bands among several stellar groups we find that inner disk emission decays with stellar age, showing a correlation with the respective disk frequencies. The disk emission at the IRAC and MIPS bands in several stellar groups indicates that disk dissipation takes place faster in the inner region of the disks. Comparison with models of irradiated accretion disks, computed with several degrees of settling, suggests that the decrease in the overall accretion rate observed in young stellar groups is not sufficient to explain the weak disk emission observed in the IRAC bands for disk bearing stars with ages 5 Myr or older.","10.1086/522882","9.0","Jesús Hernández; Nuria Calvet; César Briceño; Lee Hartmann; A.

"Zincosilicate CIT-6: A Precursor to a Family of *BEA-Type Molecular Sieves","Zincosilicate CIT-6 (California Institute of Technology number 6) that has the *BEA-type structure is synthesized at hydrothermal conditions in the presence of tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH), Li+, and Zn2+. As opposed to zeolite beta, TEA cations can be easily extracted with acetic acid containing solution from CIT-6 because the interaction between the TEA cations and CIT-6 framework is weak. The extraction at 135 °C simultaneously removes TEA cations and zinc and forms a highly hydrophobic Si−CIT-6 with very little defects. Al-containing CIT-6 can be prepared by either extracting TEA cations from as-made Al-containing CIT-6 or inserting aluminum into CIT-6 extracted at 60 °C. 29Si NMR and water adsorption data indicate that the aluminum-containing materials are different from zeolite beta prepared via direct synthesis. CIT-6 is thus shown to be a useful precursor to prepare a wide range of new molecular sieve materials that are of the *BEA type.","10.1021/jp9845726","3.0","Takahiko Takewaki; Larry W. Beck; Mark E.

"A<i>SPITZER</i>CENSUS OF TRANSITIONAL PROTOPLANETARY DISKS WITH AU-SCALE INNER HOLES","[abridged] Protoplanetary disks with AU-scale inner clearings, often referred to as transitional disks, provide a unique sample for understanding disk dissipation mechanisms and possible connections to planet formation. Observations of young stellar clusters with the Spitzer Space Telescope have amassed mid-infrared spectral energy distributions for thousands of star-disk systems from which transition disks can be identified. From a sample of 8 relatively nearby young regions (d <= 400 pc), we have identified about 20 such objects, which we term ""classical"" transition disks, spanning a wide range of stellar age and mass. We also identified two additional categories representing more ambiguous cases: ""warm excess"" objects with transition-like spectral energy distributions but moderate excess at 5.8 microns, and ""weak excess"" objects with smaller 24 micron excess that may be optically thin or exhibit advanced dust grain growth and settling. From existing Halpha emission measurements, we find evidence for different accretion activity among the three categories, with a majority of the classical and warm excess transition objects still accreting gas through their inner holes and onto the central stars, while a smaller fraction of the weak transition objects are accreting at detectable rates. We find a possible age dependence to the frequency of classical transition objects, with fractions relative to the total population of disks in a given region of a few percent at 1-2 Myr rising to 10-20% at 3-10 Myr. The trend is even stronger if the weak and warm excess objects are included. Classical transition disks appear to be less common, and weak transition disks more common, around lower-mass stars (M <= 0.3 Msun).","10.1088/0004-637x/708/2/1107","5.0","James Muzerolle; Lori Allen; S.

"Metagenetic tools for the census of marine meiofaunal biodiversity: An overview","Marine organisms belonging to meiofauna (size range: 20–500 μm) are amongst the most abundant and highly diversified metazoans on Earth including 22 over 35 known animal Phyla and accounting for more than 2/3 of the abundance of metazoan organisms. In any marine system, meiofauna play a key role in the functioning of the food webs and sustain important ecological processes. Estimates of meiofaunal biodiversity have been so far almost exclusively based on morphological analyses, but the very small size of these organisms and, in some cases, the insufficient morphological distinctive features limit considerably the census of the biodiversity of this component. Molecular approaches recently applied also to small invertebrates (including meiofauna) can offer a new momentum for the census of meiofaunal biodiversity. Here, we provide an overview on the application of metagenetic approaches based on the use of next generation sequencing platforms to study meiofaunal biodiversity, with a special focus on marine nematodes. Our overview shows that, although such approaches can represent a useful tool for the census of meiofaunal biodiversity, there are still different shortcomings and pitfalls that prevent their extensive use without the support of the classical taxonomic identification. Future investigations are needed to address these problems and to provide a good match between the contrasting findings emerging from classical taxonomic and molecular/bioinformatic tools.","10.1016/j.margen.2015.04.010","4.0","Laura Carugati; Cinzia Corinaldesi; Antonio Dell’Anno; Roberto Danovaro","2015.0","","","tools; census; biodiversity"

"Field Tests of Strip Census Methods","Twenty strip censuses were conducted in areas containing known populations of inanimate objects or, in two instances, of live animals. Each census was based on sighting or perpendicular dis- tances from straight-line transects. These data were then converted to population estimates according to 10 different strip census methods, and the results were compared with the known populations. Of the 10 methods tested, only three provided estimates sufficiently close to the actual for serious con- sideration. The two most promising methods were the belt transects of Kelker (1945) and Anderson and Pospahala (1970), both of which require a frequency distribution of perpendicular distances of the sighted objects from the census lines. The third method was King's (Leopold 1933), which utilizes the mean of sighting or flushing distances to establish the width of the census strip. This method ap- pears subject to some biases but less so than others based on sighting distances.","10.2307/3800202","3.0","W. Leslie Robinette; C. M. Loveless; Dale A.

"A comparison of underwater visual distance estimates made by scuba divers and a stereo-video system: implications for underwater visual census of reef fish abundance","Underwater visual census of reef fish by scuba divers is a widely used and useful technique for assessing the composition and abundance of reef fish assemblages, but suffers from several biases and errors. We compare the accuracy of underwater visual estimates of distance made by novice and experienced scientific divers and an underwater stereo-video system. We demonstrate the potential implications that distance errors may have on underwater visual census assessments of reef fish abundance. We also investigate how the accuracy and precision of scuba diver length estimates of fish is affected as distance increases. Distance was underestimated by both experienced (mean relative error = −11.7%, s.d. = 21.4%) and novice scientific divers (mean relative error = −5.0%, s.d. = 17.9%). For experienced scientific divers this error may potentially result in an 82% underestimate or 194% overestimate of the actual area censused, which will affect estimates of fish density. The stereo-video system also underestimated distance but to a much lesser degree (mean relative error = −0.9%, s.d. = 2.6%) and with less variability than the divers. There was no correlation between the relative error of length estimates and the distance of the fish away from the observer.","10.1071/mf03130","4.0","Euan S. Harvey; David Fletcher; Mark R.

"In vitro and in silico investigations of drug delivery via zeolite BEA","A combination of experiment and theory has been used to assess the potential use of the zeolite BEA as a drug delivery agent. Molecular dynamics (MD) has been used to examine the diffusion of two different drug molecules, salbutamol and theophylline, inside the zeolite BEA. MD shows that the two molecules display different diffusion behaviour, with the salbutamol molecule able to diffuse more freely than theophylline within the internal channel system of the zeolite. Several experimental techniques have been used to investigate the loading and release of the drug molecules from the BEA host. The results obtained support the observations from the modelling and suggest that modelling has an important role to play in screening zeolite–drug combinations prior to experimental investigation.","10.1039/c1jm10204d","10.0","Dimitrios G.

"A Cosmic Census of Radio Pulsars with the SKA","The SKA will make ground breaking discoveries in pulsar science.The wide field-of-view, high sensitivity, multi-beaming and sub-arraying capabilities, coupled with advanced pulsar search backends, will result in the discovery of a large population of pulsars and new, high-quality data on select sources from the known pulsar population.This chapter outlines surveys for new pulsars, as well as the necessary follow-up timing observations, which will enable all of the SKA's headline pulsar science goals (tests of General Relativity with pulsar binary systems, investigating black hole theorems with pulsar-black hole binaries, and direct detection of gravitational waves in a pulsar timing array).SKA Milky Way surveys at multiple frequencies will increase the number of known pulsars by more than an order of magnitude.SKA2 will potentially find all of the Galactic radio-emitting pulsars in the SKA sky which are beamed in our direction.This will give a clear picture of the birth properties of pulsars and of the gravitational potential, magnetic field structure and interstellar matter content of the Galaxy.Targeted searches will enable detection of the most exotic systems, such as the ∼ 1000 pulsars we infer to be closely orbiting Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole in the Galactic Centre.In addition to Galactic pulsars, the SKA will detect pulsars from local group galaxies, which can be used as probes of the local intergalactic medium.All of the discoveries will require regular re-observations for a few months in order to derive their spin characteristics and establish the particular science questions they can be used to address.For efficiency, live searches will be performed, using sub-arraying and dynamic scheduling to time pulsars as soon as they are discovered, while simultaneously continuing survey observations.The large projected number of discoveries suggests that we will uncover currently unknown rare systems that can be exploited to push the boundaries of our understanding of astrophysics and provide tools for testing physics, as has been done by the pulsar community in the past.","10.22323/1.215.0040","19.0","E.

"Bijective Census and Random Generation of Eulerian Planar Maps with Prescribed Vertex Degrees","Abstract: We give a bijection between Eulerian planar maps with prescribed vertex degrees, and some plane trees that we call balanced Eulerian trees. To enumerate the latter, we introduce conjugation classes of planted plane trees. In particular, the result answers a question of Bender and Canfield and allows uniform random generation of Eulerian planar maps with restricted vertex degrees. Using a well known correspondence between 4-regular planar maps with n vertices and planar maps with n edges we obtain an algorithm to generate uniformly such maps with complexity O(n). Our bijection is also refined to give a combinatorial interpretation of a parameterization of Arquès of the generating function of planar maps with respect to vertices and faces.","10.37236/1305","1.0","Gilles Schaeffer","1997.0","","","bijective; census; random; generation; eulerian; planar; maps; prescribed; vertex; degrees"
"Research note: The 2001 census and christian identification in Britain","Abstract Results from the 2001 population census suggest that nearly 72% of people in England and Wales may be identified as Christian. This figure is substantially higher than the proportion found by the British Social Attitudes survey and other national studies. Comparing the census with sample surveys and examining different parts of the UK raises two interesting questions. Why does the census produce a higher figure than recurrent surveys for nominal Christian identification? Why, when church attendance is higher in Scotland than in England and Wales, does the census show a higher proportion of nominal identifiers in the latter? It is argued that the answer to both questions is the same: anxiety about national identity. While the census results might be taken to mean that there are more Christians than expected, such an interpretation is probably mistaken.","10.1080/1353790032000165087","2.0","David Voas; Steve Bruce","2004.0","","","census; identification; britain"
"TESTING FOR TEMPORALLY DIFFERENTIATED RELATIONSHIPS AMONG POTENTIALLY CRIMINOGENIC PLACES AND CENSUS BLOCK STREET ROBBERY COUNTS","This study examined street robbery patterns in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from the years 2009 to 2011 to determine whether the effects of potentially criminogenic places are different across different periods of the day. Census block (N = 13,164) street robbery counts across four periods (6:45 a.m . to 9:59 a.m., 10:00 a.m . to 4:29 p.m ., 4:30 p.m . to 9:14 p.m ., and 9:15 p.m. to 6:44 a.m. ) were modeled with 12 different potentially criminogenic places, 3 measures of illicit markets, 4 compositional control variables, and spatially lagged versions of the 12 potentially criminogenic places and population using simultaneously estimated negative binomial regression models. Differences in the magnitudes of the parameter estimates across the time periods were assessed with Wald tests. Overall, the patterns across the four models were mostly consistent with the effects hypothesized based on the study's crime pattern theory and time‐geography theoretical frame; yet differences in the magnitudes of the coefficients were less pronounced than hypothesized. Overall, the results provide moderate support for the crime pattern theory and time‐geography explanation of spatial‐temporal robbery patterns; however, numerous points are raised for future crime and place research.","10.1111/1745-9125.12076","2.0","Cory P.

"IRS-Based Wireless Jamming Attacks: When Jammers Can Attack Without Power","This letter proposes to use Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) as a green jammer to attack a legitimate communication without using any internal energy to generate jamming signals. In particular, the IRS is used to intelligently reflect the signals from the legitimate transmitter to the legitimate receiver (LR) to guarantee that the received signals from direct and reflecting links can be added destructively, which thus diminishes the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) at the LR. To minimize the received signal power at the LR, we consider the joint optimization of magnitudes of reflection coefficients and discrete phase shifts at the IRS. Based on the block coordinate descent, semidefinite relaxation, and Gaussian randomization techniques, the solution can be obtained efficiently. Through simulation results, we show that by using the IRS-based jammer, we can reduce the signal power received at the LR by up to 99%. Interestingly, the performance of the proposed IRS-based jammer is even better than that of the conventional active jamming attacks in some scenarios.","10.1109/lwc.2020.3000892","5.0","Bin Lyu; Dinh Thai Hoang; Shimin Gong; Dusit Niyato; Dong In Kim","2020.0","","","irs; wireless; jamming; attacks; jammers; attack; without; power"
"In vitro and in silico investigations of drug delivery via zeolite BEA","A combination of experiment and theory has been used to assess the potential use of the zeolite BEA as a drug delivery agent. Molecular dynamics (MD) has been used to examine the diffusion of two different drug molecules, salbutamol and theophylline, inside the zeolite BEA. MD shows that the two molecules display different diffusion behaviour, with the salbutamol molecule able to diffuse more freely than theophylline within the internal channel system of the zeolite. Several experimental techniques have been used to investigate the loading and release of the drug molecules from the BEA host. The results obtained support the observations from the modelling and suggest that modelling has an important role to play in screening zeolite–drug combinations prior to experimental investigation.","10.1039/c1jm10204d","10.0","Dimitrios G.

"Race/ethnicity and the 2000 census: recommendations for African American and other black populations in the United States","This commentary considers the implications of the assessment of racial/ethnic status for monitoring the health of African Americans and other Black populations in the United States. It argues that because racial disparities in health and other social indicators persist undiminished, the continued assessment of race is essential. However, efforts must be made to ensure that racial data are of the highest quality. This will require uniform assessment of racial status that includes identifiers for subgroups of the Black population. Research also indicates that the health of multiracial persons varies by maternal race. Thus, efforts to monitor multiracial status should assess the race of both parents.

"The theta‐logistic is unreliable for modelling most census data","Summary 1. The theta‐logistic is a simple and flexible model for describing how the growth rate of a population slows as abundance increases. Starting at r m (taken as the maximum population growth rate), the growth response decreases in a convex or concave way (according to the shape parameter θ) to zero when the population reaches carrying capacity. 2. We demonstrate that fitting this model to census data is not robust and explain why. The parameters θ and r m are able to play‐off against each other (providing a constant product), thus allowing both to adopt extreme and ecologically implausible values. 3. We use simulated data to examine: (i) a population fluctuating around a constant carrying capacity ( K ); (ii) recovery of a population from 10% of carrying capacity; and (iii) a population subject to variation in K . We show that estimates of extinction risk depending on this or similar models are therefore prone to imprecision. We refute the claim that concave growth responses are shown to dominate in nature. 4. As the model can also be sensitive to temporal variation in carrying capacity, we argue that the assumption of a constant carrying capacity is both problematic and presents a fruitful direction for the development of phenomenological density‐feedback models.","10.1111/j.2041-210x.2010.00029.x","5.0","Francis E.

"Primary and immortalized (BEAS 2B) human bronchial epithelial cells have significant antioxidative capacity in vitro.","Antioxidant enzymes located in the bronchial epithelium can be expected to be important in protecting these cells against both endogenous and exogenous oxidants. In this study, human bronchial epithelial cells were isolated and cultured from specimens obtained from donors for lung transplantation. The levels and relative importance of different antioxidant enzymes were also assessed using an immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS 2B cells). Immunocytochemical studies showed a similar pattern of intracellular localization with the moderate degrees of labeling for Mn superoxide dismutase (SOD), CuZn SOD, and catalase in freshly isolated bronchial epithelial cells, bronchial epithelial cells in primary culture, and BEAS 2B cells. CuZn SOD and catalase decreased in labeling density whereas Mn SOD was unchanged when bronchial epithelial cells were placed in primary cultures. In contrast, Mn SOD and catalase were decreased in BEAS 2B cells compared with primary cultures. Although Mn SOD was low in BEAS 2B cells, it could be significantly induced by tumor necrosis factor treatment. Biochemical analysis showed remarkably similar catalase and glutathione reductase activities in primary cultured epithelial cells and BEAS 2B cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","10.1165/ajrcmb.11.5.7946385","7.0","VL Kinnula; James R.

"China's New Demographic Reality: Learning from the 2010 Census","China conducted its sixth modern census in 2010, recording a total of 1.34 billion people. This article presents an overview of the early census results. The data are of reasonable quality but contain some apparent defects where adjustments may be required. The census confirms that China has entered the era of demographic modernity and depicts the vast transformation of the country's rural‐urban distribution. Life expectancy has risen by 3–4 years in the decade since the last census, while fertility remains well below replacement—probably as low as 1.5 births per woman—and the sex ratio at birth is still significantly elevated. Low fertility and falling old‐age mortality are leading to continued and rapid population aging. Several coastal provinces grew by as much as 40 percent in the last decade, while a number of inland provinces have recorded population decline. China has reached an overall urban proportion of 50 percent.","10.1111/j.1728-4457.2013.00608.x","1.0","Yong Cai","2013.0","","","china; new; demographic; reality; learning; census"

"Reactive Oxygen Species-Activated Akt/ASK1/p38 Signaling Pathway in Nickel Compound-Induced Apoptosis in BEAS 2B Cells","Nickel compounds are carcinogenic to humans, possibly through induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage macromolecules including DNA and proteins. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the role of the ROS-mediated Akt/apoptosis-regulating signal kinase (ASK) 1/p38 pathway in nickel-induced apoptosis. Exposure of human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) to nickel compounds induced the generation of ROS and activation of Akt that is associated with the activation of ASK1 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Immunoblotting suggested a down-regulation of several antiapoptotic proteins, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in the nickel compound-treated cells. Indeed, a notable cell apoptosis following nickel compound treatment is evident as revealed by flow cytometry analysis. N-Acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC, a general antioxidant) and vitamin E or catalase (a specific H2O2 inhibitor) all decreased nickel-induced ROS generation. Scavenging of nickel-induced ROS by NAC or catalase attenuated Akt, ASK1, and p38 MAPK activation and apoptosis, which implies involvement of ROS in the Akt/ASK1/p38 pathway. In addition, nickel-induced activation of p38 MAPK was attenuated by a small interference of RNA specific to ASK1 (siRNA ASK1), implying that p38 MAPK was downstream of ASK1, while ASK1 activation was not reversely regulated by the inhibition of p38 MAPK by SB203580, a widely used p38 MAPK inhibitor. Silencing Akt by siRNA reduced the activation of ASK1 and p38 MAPK and cell apoptosis, whereas without nickel stimulation, siRNA Akt had no effect on the activation of ASK1 and p38 MAPK. Thus, these results suggest that the ROS-dependent Akt-ASK1-p38 axis is important for nickel-induced apoptosis.","10.1021/tx9003193","10.0","Jingju Pan; Qingshan Chang; Xin Wang; Young‐Ok Son; Zhuo Zhang; Gang Chen; Jia Luo; Yongyi Bi; Fei Chen; Xianglin Shi","2010.0","","","oxygen; species; activated; akt; ask; p; pathway; nickel; compound; induced; apoptosis; beas; b; cells"

"Background Ionizing Radiation and the Risk of Childhood Cancer: A Census-Based Nationwide Cohort Study","BackgroundExposure to medium or high doses of ionizing radiation is a known risk factor for cancer in children. The extent to which low-dose radiation from natural sources contributes to the risk of childhood cancer remains unclear.ObjectivesIn a nationwide census-based cohort study, we investigated whether the incidence of childhood cancer was associated with background radiation from terrestrial gamma and cosmic rays.MethodsChildren &lt; 16 years of age in the Swiss National Censuses in 1990 and 2000 were included. The follow-up period lasted until 2008, and incident cancer cases were identified from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. A radiation model was used to predict dose rates from terrestrial and cosmic radiation at locations of residence. Cox regression models were used to assess associations between cancer risk and dose rates and cumulative dose since birth.ResultsAmong 2,093,660 children included at census, 1,782 incident cases of cancer were identified including 530 with leukemia, 328 with lymphoma, and 423 with a tumor of the central nervous system (CNS). Hazard ratios for each millisievert increase in cumulative dose of external radiation were 1.03 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.05) for any cancer, 1.04 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.08) for leukemia, 1.01 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.05) for lymphoma, and 1.04 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.08) for CNS tumors. Adjustment for a range of potential confounders had little effect on the results.ConclusionsOur study suggests that background radiation may contribute to the risk of cancer in children, including leukemia and CNS tumors.CitationSpycher BD, Lupatsch JE, Zwahlen M, Röösli M, Niggli F, Grotzer MA, Rischewski J, Egger M, Kuehni CE, for the Swiss Pediatric Oncology Group and the Swiss National Cohort. 2015.

"A stellar census in globular clusters with MUSE: The contribution of rotation to cluster dynamics studied with 200 000 stars","This is the first of a series of papers presenting the results from our survey of 25 Galactic globular clusters with the MUSE integral-field spectrograph. In combination with our dedicated algorithm for source deblending, MUSE provides unique multiplex capabilities in crowded stellar fields and allows us to acquire samples of up to 20 000 stars within the half-light radius of each cluster. The present paper focuses on the analysis of the internal dynamics of 22 out of the 25 clusters, using about 500 000 spectra of 200 000 individual stars. Thanks to the large stellar samples per cluster, we are able to perform a detailed analysis of the central rotation and dispersion fields using both radial profiles and two-dimensional maps. The velocity dispersion profiles we derive show a good general agreement with existing radial velocity studies but typically reach closer to the cluster centres. By comparison with proper motion data we derive or update the dynamical distance estimates to 14 clusters. Compared to previous dynamical distance estimates for 47 Tuc, our value is in much better agreement with other methods. We further find significant (>3sigma) rotation in the majority (13/22) of our clusters. Our analysis seems to confirm earlier findings of a link between rotation and the ellipticities of globular clusters. In addition, we find a correlation between the strengths of internal rotation and the relaxation times of the clusters, suggesting that the central rotation fields are relics of the cluster formation that are gradually dissipated via two-body relaxation.","10.1093/mnras/stx2719","13.0","Sebastian Kamann; Tim-Oliver Husser; S.

"Control of the Morphology of All-Silica BEA-type Zeolite Synthesized in Basic Media","All-silica BEA-type (Si-BEA) zeolite readily crystallizes in fluoride quasi-neutral media, while its synthesis under basic conditions is difficult. To compare the morphological features of BEA-type materials synthesized in quasi-neutral and basic media, a two-step nucleation procedure, which allows controlled synthesis of Si-BEA under basic conditions, was developed. The procedure consists of (i) aging of the initial system at a close to neutral pH, and (ii) raising the pH and a secondary aging in basic media. This procedure was further employed to study the effect of the synthesis formulation, especially its sodium and potassium content, on the crystal morphology of Si-BEA. With an increase in the pH of the system, a gradual decrease of the size of the pyramidal (h0l) face coupled with an increase of the pinacoidal (00l) face was observed. Thus, the morphology of zeolite crystals can be varied from well-developed truncated bipyramids to platelike crystals, where the pinacoidal face is dominant. A consequence of this morphological change is the different representation of the channel systems running along the a and c axes at the crystal surface. Potassium-containing systems provided products with bimodal crystal size distribution without changes in the crystal habit. The amount of K+ was correlated with the generation of small crystals, indicating its influence on the nucleation process. Small concentrations of sodium did not bring along substantial changes in the morphology of BEA-type crystals. At higher concentration, Na+ had a pronounced structure-breaking effect, and no crystalline product was obtained. The framework defectness and hydrophobicity of the materials synthesized in basic media were studied by 29Si NMR spectroscopy and TG analyses, which revealed that the alkali-free materials possessed a concentration of defect sites and hydrophobicity similar to that of the sample obtained under fluoride quasi-neutral conditions.","10.1021/cm048799r","2.0","Olivier Larlus; Valentin Valtchev","2005.0","","","control; morphology; all; silica; bea; type; zeolite; synthesized; basic; media"
"Overestimating Fish Counts by Non-Instantaneous Visual Censuses: Consequences for Population and Community Descriptions","Background Increasingly, underwater visual censuses (UVC) are used to assess fish populations. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of protected areas for increasing fish abundance or provided insight into the natural abundance and structure of reef fish communities in remote areas. Recently, high apex predator densities (>100,000 individuals·km−2) and biomasses (>4 tonnes·ha−1) have been reported for some remote islands suggesting the occurrence of inverted trophic biomass pyramids. However, few studies have critically evaluated the methods used for sampling conspicuous and highly mobile fish such as sharks. Ideally, UVC are done instantaneously, however, researchers often count animals that enter the survey area after the survey has started, thus performing non-instantaneous UVC. Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a simulation model to evaluate counts obtained by divers deploying non-instantaneous belt-transect and stationary-point-count techniques. We assessed how fish speed and survey procedure (visibility, diver speed, survey time and dimensions) affect observed fish counts. Results indicate that the bias caused by fish speed alone is huge, while survey procedures had varying effects. Because the fastest fishes tend to be the largest, the bias would have significant implications on their biomass contribution. Therefore, caution is needed when describing abundance, biomass, and community structure based on non-instantaneous UVC, especially for highly mobile species such as sharks. Conclusions/Significance Based on our results, we urge that published literature state explicitly whether instantaneous counts were made and that survey procedures be accounted for when non-instantaneous counts are used. Using published density and biomass values of communities that include sharks we explore the effect of this bias and suggest that further investigation may be needed to determine pristine shark abundances and the existence of inverted biomass pyramids. Because such studies are used to make important management and conservation decisions, incorrect estimates of animal abundance and biomass have serious and significant implications.","10.1371/journal.pone.0011722","3.0","Christine A.

"Surveying Migrant Households: A Comparison of Census-Based, Snowball and Intercept Point Surveys","Summary Few representative surveys of households of migrants exist, limiting our ability to study the effects of international migration on sending families. We report the results of an experiment that was designed to compare the performance of three alternative survey methods in collecting data from Japanese–Brazilian families, many of whom send migrants to Japan. The three surveys that were conducted were households selected randomly from a door-to-door listing using the Brazilian census to select census blocks, a snowball survey using Nikkei community groups to select the seeds and an intercept point survey that was collected at Nikkei community gatherings, ethnic grocery stores, sports clubs and other locations where family members of migrants are likely to congregate. We analyse how closely well-designed snowball and intercept point surveys can approach the much more expensive census-based method in terms of giving information on the characteristics of migrants, the level of remittances received and the incidence and determinants of return migration.","10.1111/j.1467-985x.2009.00584.x","2.0","David McKenzie; Johan A.

"How do IRS Resources Affect the Corporate Audit Process?","ABSTRACT This study investigates how Internal Revenue Service resources affect the IRS audit process for publicly traded corporations. Using confidential IRS audit data, we examine the effect of IRS resources on the incidence and magnitude of proposed deficiencies and settlement outcomes. We find that IRS resources are positively associated with both the likelihood and magnitude of proposed deficiencies, but negatively associated with the proportion of proposed deficiencies collected. These results are consistent with the IRS focusing on fewer positions, but targeting positions supported by weaker taxpayer facts when resources are more limited. Based on our findings, we estimate the loss in tax collections from audits of LB&amp;I corporate tax returns alone exceeds the savings from reductions in the IRS enforcement budget. This study contributes to the literature examining the strategic game between tax authorities and corporate taxpayers and has important implications for policymakers, particularly in light of recent IRS budget cuts.","10.2308/accr-52520","4.0","Michelle L.

"Developing Official Stochastic Population Forecasts at the US Census Bureau","Summary The U.S. Census Bureau is approaching a critical decision regarding a major facet of its methodology for forecasting the United States population. In the past, it has relied on alternative scenarios, low, medium, and high, to reflect varying interpretations of current trends in fertility, mortality, and international migration to forecast population. This approach has limitations that have been noted in the recent literature on population forecasting. Census Bureau researchers are embarking on an attempt to incorporate probabilistic reasoning to forecast prediction intervals around point forecasts to future dates. The current literature offers a choice of approaches to this problem. We are opting to employ formal time series modeling of parameters of fertility, mortality, and international migration, with stochastic renewal processes. The endeavor is complicated by the administrative necessity to produce a large amount of racial and Hispanic origin detail in the population, as well as the ubiquitous cross‐categories of age and sex. As official population forecasts must meet user demand, we are faced with the added challenge of presenting and supporting the resulting product in a way that is comprehensible to users, many of whom have little or no comprehension of the technical forecasting literature, and are accustomed to simple, deterministic answers. We may well find a need to modify our strategy, depending on the realities that may emerge from the limitations of data, the administrative requirements of the product, and the diverse needs of our user community.","10.1111/j.1751-5823.2004.tb00233.x","2.0","John F.

"Hand Posture Classification and Recognition using the Modified Census Transform","Developing new techniques for human-computer interaction is very challenging. Vision-based techniques have the advantage of being unobtrusive and hands are a natural device that can be used for more intuitive interfaces. But in order to use hands for interaction, it is necessary to be able to recognize them in images. In this paper, we propose to apply to the hand posture classification and recognition tasks an approach that has been successfully used for face detection (B. Froba and A. Ernst, 2004). The features are based on the modified census transform and are illumination invariant. For the classification and recognition processes, a simple linear classifier is trained, using a set of feature lookup-tables. The database used for the experiments is a benchmark database in the field of posture recognition. Two protocols have been defined. We provide results following these two protocols for both the classification and recognition tasks. Results are very encouraging","10.1109/fgr.2006.62","3.0","Agnès Just; Y.

"A radio Census of binary supermassive black holes","Using archival Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) data for 3114 radio-luminous active galactic nuclei, we searched for binary supermassive black holes using a radio spectral index mapping technique which targets spatially resolved, double radio-emitting nuclei. Only one source was detected as a double nucleus. This result is compared with a cosmological merger rate model and interpreted in terms of (1) implications for post-merger time-scales for centralization of the two black holes, (2) implications for the possibility of 'stalled' systems and (3) the relationship of radio activity in nuclei to mergers. Our analysis suggests that binary pair evolution of supermassive black holes (both of masses ≥108 M⊙) spends less than 500 Myr in progression from the merging of galactic stellar cores to within the purported stalling radius for supermassive black hole pairs. The data show no evidence for an excess of stalled binary systems at small separations. We see circumstantial evidence that the relative state of radio emission between paired supermassive black holes is correlated within orbital separations of 2.5 kpc.","10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.17586.x","1.0","Sarah Burke-Spolaor","2010.0","","","radio; census; holes"

"Chronic dialysis in Brazil - report of the Brazilian Dialysis Census, 2011","INTRODUÇÃO: Dados nacionais sobre diálise crônica são fundamentais para o planejamento do tratamento. OBJETIVO: Descrever resultados do censo de diálise da Sociedade Brasileira de Nefrologia referentes a 2011 e tendências observadas de 2000 a 2011. MÉTODOS: Levantamento utilizando questionário preenchido ""on-line"" pelas unidades de diálise do Brasil usando julho de 2011 como referência para estimativas. Do total de 643 unidades com programa dialítico crônico, 353 (54,9%) responderam. RESULTADOS: O número estimado de pacientes em diálise no Brasil em 2011 foi 91.314 (42.629 em 2000, 92.091 em 2010). Para aproximadamente 85% dos pacientes, o tratamento foi pago com recursos do SUS. As estimativas de prevalência e incidência para 2011 foram de 475 e 149 pacientes em diálise por milhão da população, respectivamente. Entre prevalentes, 90,6% estavam em hemodiálise, 31,5% tinham idade > 65 anos, 28% eram diabéticos, e 35,5% (n=32.454) estavam em fila de espera para transplante. Para 2011, o número estimado de pacientes iniciando diálise foi 28.680 (18.972 em 2010) e a taxa anual de mortalidade 19,9% (17,9% para 2010). CONCLUSÕES: Os dados indicam aumento pronunciado da população em diálise no Brasil ao longo dos anos, com tendência a estabilização nos dois últimos anos. As razões para aumento da incidência e mortalidade em 2011 merecem investigação. É grande o número estimado de pacientes em fila de espera para transplante renal. O censo fornece um quadro da situação e tendências da diálise no Brasil, sendo, portanto, útil para orientar alocação de recursos e intervenções que melhorarem a qualidade do tratamento.","10.5935/0101-2800.20120009","6.0","Ricardo Sesso; António Alberto Lopes; Fernando Saldanha Thomé; Jocemir Ronaldo Lugon; Yoshimi Watanabe; Daniel Rinaldi dos Santos","2012.0","","","dialysis; brazil; report; census"

"Algorithm and Architecture of Disparity Estimation With Mini-Census Adaptive Support Weight","High-performance real-time stereo vision system is crucial to various stereo vision applications, such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, multiview video coding, freeview TV, and 3-D video conferencing. In this paper, we proposed a high-performance hardware-friendly disparity estimation algorithm called mini-census adaptive support weight (MCADSW) and also proposed its corresponding real-time very large scale integration (VLSI) architecture. To make the proposed MCADSW algorithm hardware-friendly, we proposed simplification techniques such as using mini-census, removing proximity weight, using YUV color representation, using Manhattan color distance, and using scaled-and-truncate weight approximation. After applied these simplifications, the MCADSW algorithm was not only hardware-friendly, but was also 1.63 times faster. In the corresponding real-time VLSI architecture, we proposed partial column reuse and access reduction with expanded window to significantly reduce the bandwidth requirement. The proposed architecture was implemented using United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) 90 nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology and can achieve a disparity estimation frame rate of 42 frames/s for common intermediate format size images when clocked at 95 MHz. The synthesized gate-count and memory size is 563 k and 21.3 kB, respectively.","10.1109/tcsvt.2010.2045814","5.0","Nelson Yen-Chung Chang; Tsung-Hsien Tsai; Bo-Hsiung Hsu; Yi-Chun Chen; Tian‐Sheuan Chang","2010.0","","","algorithm; architecture; disparity; mini; census; adaptive; support; weight"
"An Annotated Census of Copernicus' De revolutionibus","The Annotated Census lists and describes - on the basis of direct examination - all of the 560 located copies of the first and second editions of Copernicus' De revolutionibus orbium coelestium that survive in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, as well as several copies of known provenance destroyed, stolen or otherwise lost in modern times. The entry for each copy lists its present location and describes particulars of its binding, size, and any shelf marks. A short history is given of the provenance of each copy, wherever possible with identification of owners and dates of ownership. Marginalia and interlinear notes are also indicated together with transcription and translation of the more important ones. The content of the more significant notes is discussed (with reference to the modern literature), analyses that sometimes develop into substantial essays. Numerous plates show examples of the handwriting of the major annotators. Appendices list the other works bound with De revolutionibus, and prices at auction going back to the 18th century. The density and quality of the data provided about the copies make this a fascinating reference work not only for scholars interested in the history of astronomy but especially for all those interested in printing in the early modern period. The census will also provide an almost inexhaustible mine of information concerning the spread of ideas, scholarly networks, book collecting, and library development from the 17th to 20th centuries.","10.1163/9789004502611","1.0","Owen Gingerich","2002.0","","","annotated; census; copernicus; de; revolutionibus"

"Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) expression in rat brain.","IRS-1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after insulin stimulation and participates in the early events of signal transduction in peripheral insulin-sensitive tissues. This study determined whether neuronal populations in the rat olfactory bulb and hippocampus (brain regions which have very high concentrations of insulin receptors) also express IRS-1 and contain phosphotyrosine, using in situ hybridization, receptor binding, and immunocytochemistry. IRS-1 mRNA was colocalized with insulin receptor mRNA in neuron cell bodies of hippocampus and olfactory bulb. Similarly, IRS-1 immunoreactivity in hippocampus and olfactory bulb was concentrated in layers that contain synapses of these neurons and have both high insulin binding and phosphotyrosine levels. Thus, IRS-1 and insulin receptors are coexpressed in discrete populations of neurons, suggesting a signal transduction mechanism by which insulin may influence metabolism and gene expression in the brain.","10.1210/endo.134.4.7511094","6.0","D G Baskin; Michael W.

"Accuracy and Precision of Aerial Moose Censusing","Forty-nine observers flew 72 replicate counts over four fenced 1-square-mile (2.6 km'2) moose (Alces alces) enclosures. Under the most ideal conditions, experienced observers flying 15 minutes over each square mile in PA-18-150 aircraft saw only 68 percent of the moose present. Inexperienced observers saw 43 percent. Accuracy of counts was significantly affected by observer experience and currency, by number of observers, by snow conditions, by habitat and terrain, and by time of day. Moose density did not affect accuracy of counts at densities of seven or more per square mile. Counts were relatively precise within individual experienced observers (C.V. = 7-18 percent) and within some experience-current groups (C.V. = 8.5-9.9 percent). Experienced observers without current experience were both imprecise (C.V. = 24 percent) and inaccurate (46 percent). Aerial counts are not considered valid estimates of absolute moose numbers, but may be used as trend indicators in carefully controlled situations. J. WILDL. MANAGE. 38(2):175-182 Aerial censusing is presently the only practical way to estimate moose numbers in most of North America (Rausch and Bratlie 1965, Rausch and Bishop 1968, Bishop 1969, Bergerud and Manuel 1969). Determination of the extent to which such methods underestimate numbers has remained a problem when absolute numbers are sought. Benson (1966), Goddard (1966), and Bergerud (1968) have reviewed aerial censusing techniques and have suggested that substantial errors are inherent in most. Caughley and Goddard (1972) have suggested statistical methods for estimating these errors. Siniff and Skoog's (1964) random stratified, quadrat sampling method, modified for moose by Evans et al. (1966), made population estimations more plausible, but these techniques were still predicated on knowing what proportion of animals flown over were actually observed. More recently Mantle (1972) in Ontario and Jordan on Isle Royale (Personal communication) have xperimented with aggregate-related counting methods and new flight-path techniques.

"Nedd4-induced monoubiquitination of IRS-2 enhances IGF signalling and mitogenic activity","Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) induce proliferation of various cell types and play important roles in somatic growth and cancer development. Phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1/2 by IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase is essential for IGF action. Here we identify Nedd4 as an IRS-2 ubiquitin ligase. Nedd4 monoubiquitinates IRS-2, which promotes its association with Epsin1, a ubiquitin-binding protein. Nedd4 recruits IRS-2 to the membrane, probably through promoting Epsin1 binding, and enhances IGF-I receptor-induced IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation. In thyroid FRTL-5 cells, activation of the cyclic AMP pathway increases the association of Nedd4 with IRS-2, thereby enhancing IRS-2-mediated signalling and cell proliferation induced by IGF-I. The Nedd4 and IRS-2 association is also required for maximal activation of IGF-I signalling and cell proliferation in prostate cancer PC-3 cells. Nedd4 overexpression accelerates zebrafish embryonic growth through IRS-2 in vivo. We conclude that Nedd4-induced monoubiquitination of IRS-2 enhances IGF signalling and mitogenic activity. Phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1/2 by insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I receptor tyrosine kinase is essential for IGF signalling. Here, the authors show that monoubiquitination of IRS-2 by the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 recruits IRS-2 to the cell membrane and increases IRS-2 phosphorylation and IGF signalling.","10.1038/ncomms7780","16.0","Toshiaki Fukushima; Hidehito Yoshihara; Haruka Furuta; Hiroyasu Kamei; Fumihiko Hakuno; Jing Luan; Cunming Duan; Yasushi Saeki; Keiji Tanaka; Shun-ichiro Iemura; Tohru Natsume; Kazuhiro Chida; Yusuke Nakatsu; Hideaki Kamata; Tomoichiro Asano; Shin‐Ichiro Takahashi","2015.0","","","nedd; monoubiquitination; irs; enhances; igf; signalling; activity"

"Down-Regulation of Honey Bee IRS Gene Biases Behavior toward Food Rich in Protein","Food choice and eating behavior affect health and longevity. Large-scale research efforts aim to understand the molecular and social/behavioral mechanisms of energy homeostasis, body weight, and food intake. Honey bees (Apis mellifera) could provide a model for these studies since individuals vary in food-related behavior and social factors can be controlled. Here, we examine a potential role of peripheral insulin receptor substrate (IRS) expression in honey bee foraging behavior. IRS is central to cellular nutrient sensing through transduction of insulin/insulin-like signals (IIS). By reducing peripheral IRS gene expression and IRS protein amount with the use of RNA interference (RNAi), we demonstrate that IRS influences foraging choice in two standard strains selected for different food-hoarding behavior. Compared with controls, IRS knockdowns bias their foraging effort toward protein (pollen) rather than toward carbohydrate (nectar) sources. Through control experiments, we establish that IRS does not influence the bees' sucrose sensory response, a modality that is generally associated with food-related behavior and specifically correlated with the foraging preference of honey bees. These results reveal a new affector pathway of honey bee social foraging, and suggest that IRS expressed in peripheral tissue can modulate an insect's foraging choice between protein and carbohydrate sources.","10.1371/journal.pgen.1000896","7.0","Hongfang Wang; Navdeep S.

"IRS-1 Mediates Inhibition of Ca2+ Mobilization by Insulin via the Inhibitory G-protein Gi","Platelet agonists initiate aggregation and secretion by activating receptors coupled to the G-protein Gq, thereby raising cytosolic Ca2+, [Ca2+]i. The rise in [Ca2+]i is facilitated via inhibition of cAMP formation by the inhibitory G-protein of adenylyl cyclase, Gi. Since insulin attenuates platelet activation, we investigated whether insulin interferes with cAMP regulation. Here we report that insulin (0.5–200 nmol/liter) interferes with agonist-induced increases in [Ca2+]i (ADP, thrombin), cAMP suppression (thrombin), and aggregation (ADP). The effects of insulin are as follows: (i) independent of the P2Y12 receptor, which mediates ADP-induced cAMP lowering; (ii) not observed during Gs-mediated cAMP formation; (iii) unaffected by treatments that affect phosphodiesterases (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine); and (iv) not changed by interfering with NO-mediated regulation of cAMP degradation (NG-monomethyl-l-arginine). Hence, insulin might interfere with Gi. Indeed, insulin induces the following: (i) tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and Giα2; (ii) co-precipitation of IRS-1 with Giα2 but not with other Gα subunits. Despite persistent receptor activation, the association of IRS-1 with Giα2 is transient, being optimal at 5 min and 1 nmol/liter insulin, which is sufficient to suppress Ca2+ signaling by ADP, and at 10 min and 100 nmol/liter insulin, which is required to suppress Ca2+ signaling by thrombin. Epinephrine, a known platelet sensitizer and antagonist of insulin, abolishes the effect of insulin on [Ca2+]i, tyrosine phosphorylation of Giα2, and aggregation by interfering with the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor β subunit. We conclude that insulin attenuates platelet functions by interfering with cAMP suppression through IRS-1 and Gi. Platelet agonists initiate aggregation and secretion by activating receptors coupled to the G-protein Gq, thereby raising cytosolic Ca2+, [Ca2+]i.

We conclude that insulin attenuates platelet functions by interfering with cAMP suppression through IRS-1 and Gi. Patients with diabetes mellitus have a 2–4-fold increased risk for coronary artery disease. They suffer from both microvascular (nephropathy and retinopathy) and macrovascular (peripheral artery disease) complications (1Beckman J.A. Creager M.A. Libby P. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2002; 287: 2570-2581Google Scholar). Apart from increased concentrations of certain coagulation factors (2Carr M.E. J. Diabet. Complicat. 2001; 15: 44-54Google Scholar), patients with diabetes mellitus type I and II have platelets that show increased adhesion, aggregation, thromboxane production, and P-selectin expression (3Winocour P.D. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 26-31Google Scholar). The hyperactivity might be caused by the absence of insulin inhibition, since intensive insulin treatment in diabetic patients reduced platelet aggregation (4Turk Z. Flego I. Kerum G. Horm. Metab. Res. 1996; 28: 95-100Google Scholar). The insulin receptor is a heterotetrameric transmembrane glycoprotein composed of two extracellular α subunits (135 kDa each) and two transmembrane β subunits (95 kDa each) that function as allosteric enzymes in which the α subunit inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the β subunit. Insulin binding to the α subunit relieves the inhibition of the kinase activity in the β subunit leading to autophosphorylation of the β subunits and a conformational change that further increases the kinase activity. The insulin receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylates proteins such as Shc and the insulin receptor substrates IRS-1 (165–185 kDa) and IRS-2 (180–190 kDa). IRS-1 and IRS-2 have a highly conserved amino terminus, which contains a pleckstrin homology domain, a phosphotyrosine binding domain, and a carboxyl terminus with several tyrosine phosphorylation sites. IRS-1 and IRS-2 are complementary and act as ""docking sites"" to several Src homology 2 domains containing proteins, such as the regulatory subunits of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) 1The abbreviations used are: PI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinasePDEsphosphodiesterasesIBMX3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthinePRPplatelet-rich plasmaPGprostaglandinNOnitric oxide. (5Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Google Scholar). phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase phosphodiesterases 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine platelet-rich plasma prostaglandin nitric oxide. GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) can also act as signal transducers for the insulin receptor. G-proteins are guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins that function as molecular switches between a GTP-bound ""on state"" and a GDP-bound ""off state."" These proteins amplify, transmit, and integrate signals. The major G-proteins involved in platelet aggregation and secretion are Gqα, which mediates increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, and Giα, which inhibits adenylyl cyclase thereby suppressing cAMP that is an inhibitor of platelets (6Akkerman J.W.N. Gresele P. Page C.P. Fuster V. Vermylen J. Platelets in Thrombotic and Non-thrombotic Disorders: Pathophysiology, Pharmacology, and Therapeutics. 1st Ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2002: 204-220Google Scholar). Receptors that couple to G-proteins are generally seven-transmembrane proteins, but there are important exceptions. The insulin-like growth factor II receptor has a single transmembrane domain and couples directly to Gi2 in a manner similar to that of conventional G-protein-coupled receptors (7Kuemmerle J.F. Murthy K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7187-7194Google Scholar). Studies have been reported suggesting that the insulin receptor binds Giα2 (8Okamoto T. Okamoto T. Murayama Y. Hayashi Y. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 143-148Google Scholar, 9Krupinski J. Rajaram R. Lakonishok M. Benovic J.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12333-12341Google Scholar). The insulin receptor is present on muscle, liver, and adipose tissue but also on endothelial cells, lymphocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets. A human platelet contains ∼570 insulin receptors (10Hajek A.S. Joist J.H. Baker R.K. Jarett L. Daughaday W.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1979; 63: 1060-1065Google Scholar). Insulin binding induces phosphorylation of the β subunits (11Falcon C. Pfliegler G. Deckmyn H. Vermylen J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 1190-1196Google Scholar, 12López-Aparicio P. Rascón A. Manganiello V.C. Andersson K.E. Belfrage P. Degerman E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 517-523Google Scholar), demonstrating that the receptor is functional. In insulin-resistant patients, platelet inhibition by insulin is attenuated or absent (13Trovati M. Anfossi G. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 609-622Google Scholar, 14Westerbacka J. Yki-Järvinen H. Turpeinen A. Rissanen A. Vehkavaara S. Syrjälä M. Lassila R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 167-712Google Scholar), suggesting that in healthy individuals insulin signals to mechanisms that suppress platelet functions. Many platelet agonists initiate aggregation and secretion of granule contents via Gq which induces Ca2+ release from intracellular storage sites and an increase in [Ca2+]i. A rise in [Ca2+]i is a key step in platelet activation. It triggers granule secretion thereby releasing ADP, activates the fibrinogen receptor (integrin αIIbβ3) forming aggregates, and induces a procoagulant surface that facilitates the formation of thrombin. One of the mechanisms that suppress platelet activation is an increase in cAMP. The inhibition is mediated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. This kinase interferes with multiple steps in platelet activation cascades, such as receptor-ligand interaction, the activity of G-proteins, and the activation of phospholipase Cβ, protein kinase C, and mitogen-activated protein kinases. Protein kinase A also interferes with the elevation of [Ca2+]i and inhibits actin-binding protein and caldesmon that are involved in cytoskeletal reorganization (15Schwarz U.R. Walter U. Eigenthaler M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 1153-1161Google Scholar). Because a small rise in cAMP already leads to a strong activation of protein kinase A, platelet-activating sequences are extremely sensitive to increases in cAMP (16Eigenthaler M. Nolte C. Halbrugge M. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 471-481Google Scholar, 17van Gorp R.M.A. Feijge M.A.H. Vuist W.M.J. Rook M.B. Heemskerk J.W.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1543-1552Google Scholar). Optimal platelet functions require maximal stimulation of the Gq pathway and the concomitant inhibition of cAMP production. cAMP is formed from ATP through the action of adenylyl cyclase and is subsequently metabolized by phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Adenylyl cyclase is inhibited by Gi, which makes this G-protein a key factor in the control of cAMP formation. Gi is activated either by direct interaction with the agonist receptor or via secreted granule ADP, which activates the P2Y12 receptor via an extracellular feedback loop (18Gachet C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 222-232Google Scholar, 19Remijn J.A. Wu Y.P. Jeninga E.H. IJsseldijk M.J.W. van Willigen G. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Nurden A.T. Nurden P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Gousset L. Conley P.B. Mortensen R.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 477-483Google Scholar).

For the preparation of washed platelets, PRP was supplemented with 0.1 volume of ACD (2.5% trisodium citrate, 1.5% citric acid, 2% d-glucose) for acidification to pH 6.5 and 0.001 volume of PGI2 (10 ng/ml final concentration), centrifuged again (330 × g, 15 min, 20 °C), and resuspended in HEPES/Tyrode buffer (145 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter KCl, 0.5 mmol/liter Na2HPO4, 1 mmol/liter MgSO4, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.25) containing 5 mmol/liter d-glucose. The final platelet concentration was adjusted to 2.0 × 1011 cells/liter. Prior to the experiments, platelets were kept at 20 °C for 45 min to ensure a resting state. In some experiments platelets were incubated with AR-C69931MX (50 nmol/liter, 30 s), IBMX (1 mmol/liter, 5 min), and l-NMMA (100 μmol/liter, 20 min) at 20 °C. Measurement of Ca2+Mobilization—PRP was incubated with 3 μm Fura 2-AM (45 min, 37 °C, light-protected). After incubation, PRP was acidified with ACD to pH 6.5, centrifuged again (330 × g, 15 min, 20 °C), and resuspended in HEPES/Tyrode buffer (145 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter KCl, 0.5 mmol/liter Na2HPO4, 1 mmol/liter MgSO4, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.25) containing 5 mmol/liter d-glucose. The final platelet concentration was adjusted to 2.0 × 1011 cells/liter. Fura-2 fluorescence was recorded in 1.0-ml aliquots of platelet suspension without additional Ca2+ at 20 °C in a F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and emission at 510 nm. Changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored using the Fura-2 fluorescence ratio and calibrated according to the method of Grynkiewicz et al. (22Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar). Measurement of cAMP—Washed platelets were incubated at 20 °C. Samples were lysed in 0.33 volumes of 7% perchloric acid followed by centrifugation (11,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). cAMP levels, [cAMP], were determined in a cAMP 3H assay system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Washed platelets were incubated at 20 °C, and samples were collected in 10× lysis buffer containing 1% w/v SDS, 5% w/v n-octyl glucoside, 0.5 m EDTA, and 10% v/v Nonidet P-40, with 10% v/v protease inhibitor mixture and 1 mmol/liter Na3VO4. Detergent-insoluble material was sedimented by centrifugation for 1 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were performed with 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine, Giα2 (T-19) or IRS-1 (C-20) antibodies. Immune complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose, washed, solubilized in 3× sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels. Immunoblotting—Washed platelets were incubated at 20 °C, and samples were collected in 3× sample buffer. Aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 5% gels. Proteins were transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose sheets and blocked in either 5% Protifar, 0.1% TBST or 4% PY-BSA, 0.1% TBST. Blots were probed separately with a primary antibody (4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine, IRS-1 (C-20), Giα2 (T-19), Gzα (I-20), Gsα or Gqα antibodies for immunoprecipitations and anti-insulin receptor phospho-Tyr1158 for whole cell lysates) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. The proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (GAMPO for 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-α-rabbit horseradish peroxidase for all other antibodies, respectively). As control for lane loading, the blots were stripped by a 30-min incubation in 0.1% TBST with 2% SDS at 80 °C. After extensive washing, the blots were subjected to the same procedure as described above. Since the anti-insulin receptor phospho-Tyr1158 antibodies recognize an aspecific band at 250 kDa, this band was taken as a control for lane loading. The intensity of the bands was quantitated with ImageQuant software. Measurement of Platelet Aggregation—PRP was prepared as described above, and the platelet concentration was adjusted to 2.0 × 1011 cells/liter with platelet-poor plasma. Aliquots of 0.5 ml were warmed to 37 °C for 5 min, followed by stimulation. Platelet aggregation was monitored continuously for 7 min under 900 rpm in an aggregometer (model 570 VS, Chrono-Log Corp., Havertown, PA). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple comparisons test as post-test for repeated measurements unless mentioned otherwise. Results are expressed as means ± S.D. of n observations. Differences were considered to be significant at p < 0.05. Insulin Inhibits Agonist-induced Ca2+Mobilization—Fura 2-AM-loaded platelets were incubated at 20 °C with 1 nmol/liter insulin and stimulated with 10 μmol/liter ADP. Insulin alone did not change the basal [Ca2+]i (19.4 ± 2.7 nmol/liter), but a preincubation with insulin led to a 25 ± 6% reduction of the ADP-induced Ca2+ mobilization (Fig. 1A). Studies with different incubation times showed that optimal inhibition was observed after 5 min of preincubation. Simultaneous addition of insulin and ADP or incubation times of 15 min or longer failed to reveal the inhibition by insulin (Fig. 1B). To investigate the threshold above which insulin inhibited Ca2+ mobilization, platelets were incubated for 5 min with different concentrations of insulin followed by stimulation with ADP. There was a dose-dependent increase in the inhibition by insulin, which became significant at 0.5 nmol/liter insulin and more (Fig. 1C). ADP activates platelets via the P2Y1 receptor, which is coupled to Gq and signals to [Ca2+]i, while concurrently suppressing cAMP formation via the P2Y12 receptor and Gi (18Gachet C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 222-232Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the P2Y12 antagonist AR-C69931MX induced the same degree of inhibition of ADP-induced Ca2+ mobilization as insulin (100 nmol/liter). A combination of AR-C69931MX and insulin did not inhibit Ca2+ signaling stronger than each of these factors alone. Thus, insulin appears to inhibit ADP-induced Ca2+ mobilization by interfering with the regulation of Gi. Insulin also inhibited Ca2+ mobilization induced by thrombin. Stimulation with 0.25 units/ml thrombin induced a larger increase in [Ca2+]i than 10 μmol/liter ADP, and more insulin was required to inhibit this response. When platelets were incubated with 100 nmol/liter insulin prior to stimulation with 0.25 units/ml thrombin, a 25 ± 8% fall in the Ca2+ response was observed (Fig. 3A). Optimal inhibition required a preincubation of 10–15 min, and again there was a tendency to normalize after longer incubation (Fig. 3B). Insulin attenuated the thrombin-induced Ca2+ response dose-dependently leading to optimal inhibition at 100 nmol/liter or more after 10 min of preincubation (Fig. 3C). Effect of Insulin on the Thrombin-induced Decrease of cAMP—To investigate whether insulin interfered with the regulation of adenylyl cyclase, platelets were incubated with insulin, and [cAMP] was determined. Insulin alone (1, 10, and 100 nmol/liter) did not change the basal [cAMP] (6.7 ± 1.3 nmol/1011 platelets) during 10 min of incubation. Stimulation with thrombin (0.25 units/ml) induced a 60% decrease of basal cAMP, as in agreement with a previous publication (23Juska A. Farndale R.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 245-253Google Scholar). This reduction was smaller when insulin (100 nmol/liter) and thrombin were added simultaneously and completely disappeared after 10 min of preincubation with insulin (Fig. 4A). Addition of PGI2 (10 ng/ml) raised [cAMP] to 27.3 ± 2.0 nmol/1011 platelets in 10 min. A similar rise was found when platelets were preincubated for 10 min with insulin (1, 10, and 100 nmol/liter). Thus, insulin failed to interfere with the activation of adenylyl cyclase by PGI2 (Fig. 4B). To assess whether insulin interfered with cAMP degradation, platelets were treated with IBMX, an inhibitor of PDEs. IBMX raised the basal [cAMP] to 12.5 ± 2.9 nmol/1011 platelets in 5 min, and this effect was not disturbed by insulin. Again, thrombin interfered with the rise in cAMP, and insulin abolished the effect of thrombin. Thus, insulin only interfered with cAMP regulation in the presence of an agonist that activates Gi (Fig. 4C). Earlier studies with platelets suspended in plasma suggested that insulin inhibited platelets by raising [cAMP] (24Trovati M. Anfossi G. Massucco P. Mattiello L. Costamagna C. Piretto V. Mularoni E. Cavalot F. Bosia F. Bosia A. Ghigo D. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 742-749Google Scholar). This effect was attributed to insulin-induced formation of nitric oxide (NO) via NO synthase and subsequent inhibition of PDE3b. To investigate whether a similar mechanism was present in isolated platelet suspensions, platelets were treated with l-NMMA, an inhibitor of NO synthase. l-NMMA did not change the basal [cAMP] or the rise induced by PGI2. Also the suppression of the [cAMP] increase by thrombin was left undisturbed. Again, insulin interfered with the fall in cAMP induced by thrombin, and this effect was the same in the absence and presence of l-NMMA (Fig. 4D). These data argue against a role for NO-mediated cAMP control in the present studies. Insulin Increases the Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Giα2—To address the question whether insulin interfered with the regulation of cAMP formation via Gi, immunoprecipitation studies were performed using an anti-Giα2 antibody, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of Giα2 on Western blot was measured using a 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Treatment of platelets with 1 nmol/liter insulin induced a transient increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Giα2, with an optimal effect between 2 and 5 min (Fig. 5, A and C). Similar results were obtained in immunoprecipitates with 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody on blots with a Giα2 antibody (Fig. 5B). A 5-min incubation period with increasing concentrations of insulin (0.5, 1, and 10 nmol/liter) showed a dose-dependent increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Giα2 (see below). These results suggest that insulin interfered with the fall in cAMP via tyrosine phosphorylation of Giα2. IRS-1 Co-precipitates with Giα2—To investigate whether IRS-1 played a role in insulin signaling to Giα2, platelets were treated with insulin, and immunoprecipitates of Giα2 were analyzed for IRS-1. As shown in Fig. 6A, preincubation with 1 nmol/liter insulin induced association of Giα2 with IRS-1 reaching a maximum after 5 min. Thereafter was a rapid decline in the appearance of the IRS-1 band, and after 10 min it had disappeared. Increasing the insulin concentration to 100 nmol/liter led to a stronger co-association between Giα2 and IRS-1 and a slower dissociation of the two components. Here, complex formation was apparent between 5 and 10 min. These findings suggest that IRS-1 takes part in insulin signaling to Giα2 by direct binding to the G-protein subunit and demonstrate that the association depends on the insulin concentration showing a weak and short interaction at 1 nmol/liter insulin and a stronger and more persistent interaction at 100 nmol/liter insulin. The co-association between IRS-1 and Giα2 found in Giα2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6A) was also present in immunoprecipitates of IRS-1 analyzed with a Giα2 antibody (Fig. 6B). A survey for the presence of Gqα, Gsα, and Gzα was negative, indicating that the interaction between IRS-1 and a Gα subunit was specific for Giα2. Phosphorylation of the Insulin Receptor and IRS-1—The transient nature of the tyrosine phosphorylation of Giα2 (Fig. 5) and the co-association of IRS-1 with Giα2 (Fig. 6) suggested that signal generation by the insulin receptor was equally transient. To clarify how the insulin receptor was activated, the phosphorylation of the receptor β subunit was measured with an antibody against phospho-Tyr1158 of the insulin receptor. Treatment of platelets with increasing concentrations of insulin for 15 min induced a dose-dependent phosphorylation of the β subunit (Fig. 7A). Time courses over a 15-min incubation period showed that 1 nmol/liter insulin induced an increase in β subunit phosphorylation that reached a plateau after 5 min and that 100 nmol/liter insulin induced a 5-fold stronger phosphorylation that reached a plateau after 25 min (Fig. 7, B and C and not shown). Importantly, there was no indication of receptor dephosphorylation during this period at either insulin concentration. Concurrent analysis of IRS-1 showed a dose-dependent phosphorylation induced by insulin. Both at 1 and 100 nmol/liter insulin, this phosphorylation was transient showing an optimum between 5 and 10 min and decreasing to prestimulating values after 15 min. Thus, the transient phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Giα2 was not caused by receptor inactivation but was the result of interference with insulin signaling at a step downstream of receptor activation and upstream of the formation of an IRS-1-Giα2 complex. Effect of Epinephrine on Insulin-induced Platelet Inhibition—Epinephrine is known to enhance the sensitivity of platelets to activating agents by reducing the level of cAMP (23Juska A. Farndale R.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 245-253Google Scholar, 25Yang J. Wu J. Kowalska M.A. Dalvi A. Prevost N. O'Brien P.J. Manning D. Poncz M. Lucki I. Blendy J.A. Brass L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9984-9989Google Scholar, 26Riondino S. Gazzaniga P.P. Pulcinelli F.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 320-325Google Scholar) and to antagonize the effect of insulin in rat skeletal muscle by decreasing the IRS-1-associated activity of PI3K (27Hunt D.G. Ding Z. Ivy J.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 92: 1285-1292Google Scholar). To investigate whether epinephrine interfered with the effects of insulin on [Ca2+]i, platelets were incubated for 5 min with insulin (1 and 10 nmol/liter), and epinephrine (10 μmol/liter) was added 1 min prior to stimulation with ADP. Epinephrine increased ADP-induced Ca2+ mobilization by about 20% (Fig. 8A). The lower Ca2+ increase in the presence of insulin (1 and 10 nmol/liter) completely normalized in the presence of epinephrine. Thus, epinephrine abolished the inhibition by insulin. To investigate whether a similar neutralization was found at the level of cAMP, platelets were treated with epinephrine and thrombin followed by PGI2 with or without 5 min of preincubation with insulin (100 nmol/liter) (Fig. 8B). Epinephrine alone or in combination with insulin abolished the rise in [cAMP] induced by PGI2. Since insulin alone did not change PGI2-induced cAMP increases (Fig. 4B), these changes are caused by epinephrine. Thrombin induced a 73% fall in [cAMP], and this fall increased further in the presence of epinephrine. Again, the effect of insulin on the decrease in [cAMP] induced by thrombin completely disappeared when epinephrine was present. Collectively, these data illustrate that epinephrine abolishes the effect of insulin on the regulation of cAMP. To investigate whether epinephrine interfered with insulin at the level of Giα2, an immunoprecipitation was performed using a 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of Giα2 was measured on Western blot. Insulin induced a dose-dependent increase in Giα2 tyrosine phosphorylation. This increase was completely abolished by epinephrine (Fig. 8C). To determine whether epinephrine interfered with insulin signaling at the level of the insulin receptor, the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor β subunit was measured. Insulin increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of the β subunit, which was abolished by the addition of epinephrine. Preincubation with sodium vanadate, an inhibitor of protein-tyrosine phosphatases, partially reversed the effects of epinephrine on the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (Fig. 8D). These findings indicate that epinephrine neutralizes the inhibition by insulin by blocking the tyrosine phosphorylation of both Giα2 and the insulin receptor β subunit. Effect of Insulin on Platelet Aggregation in PRP—To address the question whether this mechanism was also functional in PRP, an aggregation assay was performed at 37 °C. PRP was preincubated for 2 min with 1 nmol/liter insulin and 10 μmol/liter epinephrine was added 1 min prior to initiation of aggregation with 10 μmol/liter ADP. Epinephrine enhanced the aggregation response to ADP. Insulin inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation without affecting the shape change response. The addition of epinephrine neutralized the inhibition of insulin such that the difference in platelet aggregation proved not to be significant (Fig. 9). These results illustrate that platelet inhibition by insulin is also present in PRP. Sensitivity of Ca2+Increases to Inhibition by cAMP—As illustrated in Figs. 1 and 3, ADP-induced Ca2+ rises were inhibited following a short (about 5 min) incubation with 1 nmol/liter insulin. In contrast, inhibition of thrombin-induced Ca2+ rises required a longer (about 10 min) incubation with a higher dose of insulin (100 nmol/liter). To investigate whether this difference was caused by a factor downstream of the formation of cAMP, Ca2+ increases in","10.1074/jbc.m305474200","5.0","Irlando Andrade Ferreira; Kurt L.

"‘To define the indefinable’: population classification and the census in South Africa","The population of many countries, including South Africa, has been classified into discrete groups from colonial times until the present day, for purposes of census enumeration. A reading of the census results requires an understanding of the subtleties and shifts of the classification system, which were frequently related to a definition of legal and political rights, including place of residence. The national census has tended to reinforce the groups it was initially meant only to observe.","10.1111/1475-4762.00097","1.0","Christopher Amato","2002.0","","","population; classification; census; south; africa"
"Racial Reorganization and the United States Census 1850–1930: Mulattoes, Half-Breeds, Mixed Parentage, Hindoos, and the Mexican Race","Between 1850 and 1930, demographic upheaval in the United States was connected to reorganization of the racial order. Socially and politically recognized boundaries between groups shifted, new groups emerged, others disappeared, and notions of who belonged in which category changed. All recognized racial groups—blacks, whites, Indians, Asians, Mexicans and others—were affected. This article investigates how and why census racial classification policies changed during this period, only to stabilize abruptly before World War II. In the context of demographic transformations and their political consequences, we find that census policy in any given year was driven by a combination of scientific, political, and ideological motivations. Based on this analysis, we rethink existing theoretical approaches to censuses and racial classification, arguing that a nation's census is deeply implicated in and helps to construct its social and political order. Censuses provide the concepts, taxonomy, and substantive information by which a nation understands its component parts as well as the contours of the whole; censuses both create the image and provide the mirror of that image for a nation's self-reflection. We conclude by outlining the meaning of this period in American history for current and future debates over race and classification.","10.1017/s0898588x08000047","2.0","Jennifer L.

"IRS Pleckstrin Homology Domains Bind to Acidic Motifs in Proteins","Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we identified several proteins that interact with the PH domains in IRS-1 and IRS-2, including Lon protease, myeloblast protein, and nucleolin. Although the roles of these molecules in insulin action are not yet known, each protein contained an acidic motif that interacted with the PH domain of IRS-2. However, only the acidic motif in nucleolin bound to IRS-1, suggesting that the PH domain in IRS-1 and IRS-2 are not identical. Moreover, synthetic peptides based on the acidic motif in Lon protease and myeloblast protein inhibited the binding of nucleolin to the PH domain of IRS-2 but not to the PH domain of IRS-1, confirming the selectivity of these PH domains. The ability to bind acidic motifs may be a specific function of the PH domain in IRS proteins, because the PH domains in betaARK, phospholipase Cgamma, or spectrin did not bind nucleolin. In 32D cells, nucleolin bound to both IRS-1 and IRS-2, and expression of the acidic motif of nucleolin inhibited insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2. These results suggest that the binding of acidic motifs to the PH domain of IRS-1 and IRS-2 disrupts coupling to the activated insulin receptor. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the PH domain in the IRS proteins may ordinarily bind acidic peptide motifs in membrane proteins or other acidic membrane elements that couple IRS proteins to activated membrane receptors.","10.1074/jbc.273.47.31061","7.0","Deborah J.

"The Immigrant and Native-Born Wage Distributions: Evidence from United States Censuses","Recent studies document a large widening of the immigrant/native-born mean wage gap since about 1970, a trend that some observers ascribe to post-1965 changes in U.S. immigration policy. These studies are limited, however, by their exclusive focus on men, which ignores important gender differences in the wage gap, and by the inadequacy of the mean wage for characterizing the gap when, as in recent decades, the wage distribution dramatically changes. This study of recent immigrants examines changes across the entire wage distribution, for both genders. The authors find evidence, based partly on gender differences, that minimum wages strongly influenced the gap. A counterfactual analysis also indicates that if recent immigrants in 1970 had faced the 1990 wage structure, their wage distribution would have closely resembled that of recent immigrants in 1990. These and other results suggest that the increasing wage gap is linked to changes in the wage structure.","10.1177/001979390205600106","2.0","Kristin F.

"The Census Bureau and Its Accountability","Since the early 1980s, the decennial census has been embroiled in unrelenting controversies concerning the proposed use of statistical sampling to combat the undercount. These controversies have produced numerous analyses by statisticians, legal scholars, political scientists, and historians with different attributes and analytical frameworks. This article presents these controversies from an administrative perspective, with emphasis on accountability and accountability conflicts. As an administrative agency with its mission to produce accurate and credible statistics—free from political manipulation—the Census Bureau is accountable to its hierarchical authority in the Department of Commerce, Congress, the statistical community, and the courts. Conflicts often take place among these accountability dimensions, breeding controversies in census operations, hindering the bureau's efficiency, and threatening the credibility of census statistics. This article analyzes the causes and consequences of these conflicts and presents ideas for further exploration on the issue of accountability conflict and its impact on the quality and credibility of census statistics.","10.1177/0275074006290057","1.0","Phung Nguyen","2007.0","","Decennial Census","census; bureau; accountability"
"First Impressions from the 2000 Census of China","The 2000 census of China has several notable innovations, including a sample long form containing detailed items on migration, housing, and employment. Preliminary data indicate rapid urbanization and continued rapid social change in the 1990s, and apparent success in the government's drive to curtail population growth. Although a post‐enumeration survey indicates that overall data quality is good, the rise of a mobile “floating population” and pressures of the birth planning program caused problems for the enumeration of migrants and infants.

"A<i>CHANDRA</i>/HETGS CENSUS OF X-RAY VARIABILITY FROM Sgr A* DURING 2012","We present the first systematic analysis of the X-ray variability of Sgr A* during the Chandra X-ray Observatory's 2012 Sgr A* X-ray Visionary Project. With 38 High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer observations spaced an average of 7 days apart, this unprecedented campaign enables detailed study of the X-ray emission from this supermassive black hole at high spatial, spectral and timing resolution. In 3 Ms of observations, we detect 39 X-ray flares from Sgr A*, lasting from a few hundred seconds to approximately 8 ks, and ranging in 2–10 keV luminosity from ∼1034 erg s−1 to 2 × 1035 erg s−1. Despite tentative evidence for a gap in the distribution of flare peak count rates, there is no evidence for X-ray color differences between faint and bright flares. Our preliminary X-ray flare luminosity distribution dN/dL is consistent with a power law with index ; this is similar to some estimates of Sgr A*'s near-IR flux distribution. The observed flares contribute one-third of the total X-ray output of Sgr A* during the campaign, and as much as 10% of the quiescent X-ray emission could be comprised of weak, undetected flares, which may also contribute high-frequency variability. We argue that flares may be the only source of X-ray emission from the inner accretion flow.","10.1088/0004-637x/774/1/42","17.0","Joseph Neilsen; Michael A. Nowak; Charles F.

"Pigmentocracies: Educational inequality, skin color and census ethnoracial identification in eight Latin American countries","For the first time, most Latin American censuses ask respondents to self-identify by race or ethnicity allowing researchers to examine long-ignored ethnoracial inequalities. However, reliance on census ethnoracial categories could poorly capture the manifestation(s) of race that lead to inequality in the region, because of classificatory ambiguity and within-category racial or color heterogeneity. To overcome this, we modeled the relation of both interviewer-rated skin color and census ethnoracial categories with educational inequality using innovative data from the 2010 America's Barometer from the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) and 2010 surveys from the Project on Ethnicity and Race in Latin America (PERLA) for eight Latin American countries (Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru). We found that darker skin color was negatively and consistently related to schooling in all countries, with and without extensive controls. Indigenous and black self-identification was also negatively related to schooling, though not always at a statistically significant and robust level like skin color. In contrast, results for self-identified mulattos, mestizos and whites were inconsistent and often counter to the expected racial hierarchy, suggesting that skin color measures often capture racial inequalities that census measures miss.","10.1016/j.rssm.2015.02.002","3.0","Edward Telles; René D.

"Energy Efficient Robust Beamforming and Cooperative Jamming Design for IRS-Assisted MISO Networks","Energy-efficient design and secure communications are of crucial importance in wireless communication networks. However, the energy efficiency achieved by using physical layer security can be limited by the channel conditions. In order to tackle this problem, an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted multiple input single output (MISO) network with independent cooperative jamming is studied. The energy efficiency is maximized by jointly designing the transmit and jamming beamforming and IRS phase-shift matrix under both the perfect channel state information (CSI) and the imperfect CSI. In order to tackle the challenging non-convex fractional problems, an algorithm based on semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation is proposed for solving energy efficiency maximization problem under the perfect CSI case while an alternate optimization algorithm based on <i xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">S</i> -procedure is used for solving the problem under the imperfect CSI case. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design outperforms the benchmark schemes in term of energy efficiency. Moreover, the tradeoff between energy efficiency and the secrecy rate is found in the IRS-assisted MISO network. Furthermore, it is shown that IRS can help improve energy efficiency even with the uncertainty of the CSI.","10.1109/twc.2020.3043325","4.0","Qun Wang; Fuhui Zhou; Rose Qingyang Hu; Yi Qian","2020.0","","","energy; efficient; robust; beamforming; cooperative; jamming; irs; assisted; miso; networks"
"Livestock production and population census in Pakistan: Determining their relationship with agricultural GDP using econometric analysis","Livestock is a subsector of Pakistan agriculture which contributes approximately 56% of value addition in agriculture and nearly 11% to the gross domestic product (GDP).

In order to highlight the actual performance of livestock production and livestock and poultry products, the study explored the relationship between agricultural GDP and livestock product output, including milk, beef, mutton, poultry meat, eggs, wool, hair, skins, hides and bones, in Pakistan over the 35 year period from 1980 to 2015. Time series data were collected from the National Food Security and Research, the Economic Survey of Pakistan and the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (various publications). Livestock data were analysed using the ordinary least squares (OLS) method and the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, and the results were interpreted using the Johansen co-integration test. Our study found that the output of milk, fat, eggs, bones and mutton has a positive, significant relationship to the agricultural GDP of Pakistan, while the output of beef, poultry meat, wool, hair, skins and hides has a negative, insignificant relationship to the agricultural GDP of Pakistan. Therefore, the study suggests that the government of Pakistan initiates new funding schemes for the development of the livestock sector.","10.1016/j.inpa.2017.03.002","4.0","Abdul Rehman; Luan Jingdong; Abbas Ali Chandio; Imran Hussain","2017.0","","","livestock; production; population; census; pakistan; determining; relationship; gdp"
"An Evaluation of Population Projection Errors for Census Tracts","Abstract Population projections are widely used in both the public and private sectors for planning, budgeting, and analysis. For these purposes, projections are often needed for small areas such as census tracts, zip code areas or traffic analysis zones. Population size, growth constraints, shifting boundaries, and data availability create special problems for small-area projections, however, and very little is known about their forecasting performance. In this article we evaluate the accuracy and bias of projections of total population and population by age group for census tracts in three counties in Florida. We use data from 1970 and 1980 and several simple extrapolation techniques to produce projections for 1990; we then compare these projections with 1990 census counts and evaluate the differences. For the total sample, we find mean absolute errors of 17%-20% for the three most accurate techniques for projecting total population and find no indication of overall bias. For individual age groups, mean absolute errors range from 20%-29%. We believe that this analysis provides valuable information for demographers, planners, marketers, and others who make extensive use of small-area projections.","10.1080/01621459.1995.10476489","2.0","Stanley K.

"A BREEDING BIRD CENSUS AND NESTING SUCCESS IN CENTRAL AMERICA","SUMMARY In a park‐like area of 3.75 acres adjoining primary forest in Costa Rica, at an altitude of 2,500 ft., 83 nests, made by about 49 pairs of birds and two single females, were found in one year. Over a period of 20 years, 64 species were recorded as nesting in this same area. The difficulties of learning the actual rate of success of nesting birds are discussed, and it is concluded that, in view of the impossibility of assessing the effects of visits of inspection to nests in natural habitats, statements of breeding success are at best rough approximations of what happens in the absence of an observer. In the area of the census, nest‐success (the proportion of nests in which at least one egg was laid that produced at least one living fledgling) was 38–53% in four different years. During the four years 41 % of 208 nests were successful. Of 756 nests of 23 species of altricial birds of the Central American lowlands that build open or roofed nests in clearings and second‐growth, 37% were successful. When the computation is restricted to nests found before the last egg was laid (class B nests), 35% of 434 nests were successful, and 30% of 883 eggs produced living fledglings. In the neighbouring forests, nesting success was much lower, only 23.5% of 136 open or roofed nests producing at least one fledgling. Many forest birds increase their chances of success by entering neighbouring clearings to breed, but few open‐country birds build their nests in the forest. In both forest and clearings, hole‐nesting birds in Central America are much more successful than open‐nesters, as has been found also in the North Temperate Zone. A comparison of the results of a single season's observations in each of six Central American localities shows an increase of nesting success with altitude. In lowland Panama, the nest‐success was only 21%, in the Subtropical Zone of Costa Rica 53%, and in the altitudinal Temperate Zone of Guatemala 55%. The effect of altitude is complicated by differences in the amount of forest in the localities chosen for study, as well as by other factors difficult to assess. In both the tropics and the North Temperate Zone, nest losses are substantially higher in woodland than in man‐made habitats, evidently because there are fewer predators in the latter; but, even in clearings in Central America, nesting success was considerably lower than it was found to be in numerous studies in the North Temperate Zone. The difference may, however, reflect the greater “wildness” of the localities where the writer's studies were made, rather than a true contrast between tropical and temperate zone conditions. Snakes appear to be of the greatest single cause of nest losses in tropical America, but mammals, a few predatory birds, ants, and possibly even bats, destroy many eggs and young. Since small broods and heavy predation permit only a small annual contribution to the adult population, it is evident that, in order to maintain the species, adults must enjoy fairly long lives. Recent statistical studies support this theoretical conclusion.","10.1111/j.1474-919x.1966.tb07248.x","1.0","Alexander F.

"Muscle-Specific IRS-1 Ser→Ala Transgenic Mice Are Protected From Fat-Induced Insulin Resistance in Skeletal Muscle","Insulin resistance in skeletal muscle plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, yet the cellular mechanisms responsible for insulin resistance are poorly understood. In this study, we examine the role of serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 in mediating fat-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle in vivo.To directly assess the role of serine phosphorylation in mediating fat-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, we generated muscle-specific IRS-1 Ser(302), Ser(307), and Ser(612) mutated to alanine (Tg IRS-1 Ser-->Ala) and IRS-1 wild-type (Tg IRS-1 WT) transgenic mice and examined insulin signaling and insulin action in skeletal muscle in vivo.Tg IRS-1 Ser-->Ala mice were protected from fat-induced insulin resistance, as reflected by lower plasma glucose concentrations during a glucose tolerance test and increased insulin-stimulated muscle glucose uptake during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. In contrast, Tg IRS-1 WT mice exhibited no improvement in glucose tolerance after high-fat feeding. Furthermore, Tg IRS-1 Ser-->Ala mice displayed a significant increase in insulin-stimulated IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and Akt phosphorylation in skeletal muscle in vivo compared with WT control littermates.These data demonstrate that serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 plays an important role in mediating fat-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle in vivo.","10.2337/db06-0454","13.0","Katsutaro Morino; Susanne Neschen; Stefan Bilz; Saki Sono; Dimitrios N.

"Weighted Sum-Rate Maximization for Multi-IRS Aided Cooperative Transmission","This letter investigates multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) aided wireless network, where the IRSs are deployed to cooperatively assist communications between a multi-antenna base station (BS) and the multiple single-antenna cell-edge users. We aim at maximizing the weighted sum rate of all the cell-edge users by jointly optimizing the BS's transmit beamforming and IRS's phase shifts. Especially, the beamforming is optimally obtained based on the Lagrangian method, and the phase shifts are obtained based on the Riemannian manifold conjugate gradient (RMCG) method. Numerical results show that a significant gain is improved with the aid of IRSs.","10.1109/lwc.2020.2999356","4.0","Zhengfeng Li; Meng Hua; Qingxia Wang; Qingheng Song","2020.0","","","sum; rate; maximization; multi; irs; aided; cooperative; transmission"
"Detection of Density‐Dependent Effects in Annual Duck Censuses","Annual censuses of duck populations from two localities differing in environmental variability were used to test the effectiveness of six tests of density dependence. The magnitude of Type I error for each test was estimated from simulated density—independent data having the same mean and variance as the observed censuses. The actual census data were used to evaluate the ability to detect density dependence. Only autoregression had the desired level of type I error, but this test was ineffective when populations grew or declined. The standard major axis was effective in the latter cases but was ineffective when populations did not grow or decline. The only effective test applicable to all cases was a regression test with a rejection region based oin simulated data. Results of these latter analyses agree with earlier descriptions of interspecific variation in life—history tactics among duck species and the importance of competition as a factor affecting guild structure in prairie—nesting ducks. Diving ducks, which occupy the most temporally stable wetlands, show a greater degree of density dependence than do dabbling ducks, and competition influences the guild structure of diving ducks more than that of dabbling ducks.","10.2307/1939462","2.0","William L.

"IRS-Enhanced Energy Detection for Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","Energy detection is of crucial importance in cognitive radio networks. However, its performance is poor when the channel fading is severe, which causes interference to the primary users. In order to tackle this issue, an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-enhanced energy detection for spectrum sensing is proposed. Both the cases with and without the direct link between the primary user and the secondary user are considered. By using the Gamma distribution approximation and central limit theorem, the closed-form expressions for the average probability of detection are derived. In order to further improve the detection performance, IRS-enhanced energy detection for cooperative spectrum sensing and multiple IRSs-enhanced square-law selection diversity reception are also proposed. Expressions for the average probability of detection for these two schemes are provided by using the <inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${K}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> -rank fushion criterion and square-law selection, respectively. Simulation results verify our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed IRS-enhanced energy detection compared with the benchmark schemes in terms of the spectrum sensing performance.","10.1109/lwc.2021.3099121","7.0","Wei Wu; Zi Wang; Lu Yuan; Fuhui Zhou; Fei Lang; Baoyun Wang; Qihui Wu","2021.0","","","irs; enhanced; energy; detection; spectrum; sensing; cognitive; radio; networks"
"Phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 by casein kinase II.","IRS-1, a principal substrate of the insulin receptor, is phosphorylated on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues in a variety of tissues during insulin stimulation. Casein kinase II, an insulin-sensitive serine/threonine kinase, catalyzed the in vitro incorporation of 1 to 2 mol of phosphate/mol of recombinant rat IRS-1. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of IRS-1 phosphorylated by casein kinase II in vitro and IRS-1 immunoprecipitated from intact Chinese hamster ovary cells demonstrated multiple common phosphopeptides, suggesting that overexpressed IRS-1 is a substrate for casein kinase II in these cells. Moreover, the common phosphopeptides that appeared to be insulin-sensitive in intact cells comprised 22% of casein kinase II-catalyzed 32P incorporation into IRS-1 in vitro. These data suggest that casein kinase II mediates a portion of the insulin-stimulated serine/threonine phosphorylation of overexpressed IRS-1 in vivo. By using phosphoamino acid analysis, strong cation exchange analysis, manual Edman degradation, and automated amino acid sequencing, Thr-502 was identified as the major casein kinase II-catalyzed phosphorylation site in rat IRS-1. Furthermore, Ser-99, an additional site labeled at low yield, appeared to be contained in an insulin-sensitive phosphopeptide. Thus, casein kinase II-catalyzed phosphorylation of IRS-1 may be a component of the intracellular insulin signalling cascade.","10.1016/s0021-9258(17)46824-4","6.0","Milenko J. Tanasijevic; Martin G.

"The Modern Census: Evolution, Examples and Evaluation","Summary A national census provides important information on a country's population that is used in government planning and to underpin the national statistical system. Therefore, the quality of such information is paramount but is not as simple as the crude accuracy of population totals. Furthermore, changes in the pace and nature of modern life, such as the growing geographical mobility of the population, increasingly pose challenges to census practice and data quality. More recently, even the need for a census has been questioned on grounds of financial austerity and widespread availability of alternative population information sources. This article reviews how the modern census originated and how it evolved to confront these challenges, driven by indicators of quality and needs of users, and provides reflections on the future of the census within the national statistical infrastructure. To illustrate our discussions, we use case studies from a diverse range of national contexts. We demonstrate the implications that a country's needs, circumstances and experiences have on the census approach and practice while identifying the fundamental demographic assumptions.","10.1111/insr.12036","3.0","Bernard Baffour; Thomas King; P.

These observations clearly reveal the presence of a binary jet, with each component approximately centered on the 7 mm compact protoplanetary disks previously reported. As anticipated from results at various wavelengths, L1551 IRS 5 is a binary system where each star is surrounded by a disk and drives a collimated jet. The curved morphology of the northern jet, showing reflection symmetry, is suggestive of that expected for a source in a binary orbit. A region of radio emission located between the two jets could be a zone of shock interaction between the two outflows.","10.1086/374882","6.0","Luis F. Rodrı́guez; Alicia Porras; M. J. Claussen; S.

"The status of Australian nurse practitioners: the second national census","Objectives. To profile Australian nurse practitioners and their practice in 2009 and compare results with a similar 2007 census. Methods. Self-administered questionnaire. Results. A total of 293 nurse practitioners responded (response rate 76.3%). The majority were female (n = 229, 81.2%); mean age was 47.3 years (s.d. = 8.1). As in 2007, emergency nurse practitioners represented the largest clinical specialty (n = 63, 30.3%). A majority practiced in a metropolitan area (n = 133, 64.3%); a decrease from 2007. Consistent with 2007, only 71.5% (n = 208) were employed as a nurse practitioner and 22.8% (n = 46) were awaiting approval for some or all of their clinical protocols. Demographic data, allocations of tasks, and patterns of practice remained consistent with 2007 results. ‘No Medicare provider number’ (n = 182, 91.0%), ‘no authority to prescribe using the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme’ (n = 182, 89.6%) and ‘lack of organisational support’ (n = 105, 52.2%) were reported as ‘limiting’ or ‘extremely limiting’ to practice. Conclusions. Our results demonstrate less than satisfactory uptake of the nurse practitioner role despite authorisation. Barriers constraining nurse practitioner practice reduced but remained unacceptably high. Adequate professional and political support is necessary to ensure the efficacy and sustainability of this clinical role. What is known about the topic? The nurse practitioner is a developing new model of healthcare delivery that performs an advanced clinical role and is becoming increasingly important in the overburdened Australian healthcare system. Our census conducted in 2007 indicated that nurse practitioners perceived many barriers to their practice and were underutilised in the Australian healthcare workforce, specifically because of their inability to prescribe medications. What does this paper add? This paper provides a second census of Australian nurse practitioners in 2009. Similar to the results in 2007, the study indicates that nurse practitioners remain underutilised, with many unable to perform roles within their defined scope of practice because of limitations, such as inability to prescribe medications, lack of a Medicare provider number and awaiting approval for clinical protocols. Lack of support from within healthcare organisations and the nursing profession also were found. What are the implications for practitioners? Nurse practitioners are not being utilised to their maximum clinical capacity despite increasing pressures on the health system. Many of the barriers to nurse practitioner practice that were flagged in 2007 remained issues in 2009. It is hoped the current legislative reform through the Health Legislation Amendment (Midwives and Nurse Practitioners) Act 2010 (Cth) will adequately address these issues.","10.1071/ah10987","4.0","Sandy Middleton; Anne Gardner; Glenn Gardner; Phillip Della","2011.0","","","status; nurse; practitioners; census"

"Irrigated area mapping in heterogeneous landscapes with MODIS time series, ground truth and census data, Krishna Basin, India","Diverse irrigated areas were mapped in the Krishna River Basin (258,912 km2), southern India, using an irrigated fraction approach and multiple ancillary data sources. Unsupervised classification of a monthly time series of net difference vegetation index (NDVI) images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) over January–December 2002 generated 40 classes. Nine generalized classes included five irrigated classes with distinct NDVI time signatures: continuous irrigation, double‐cropped, irrigated with low biomass, minor irrigation, and groundwater irrigation. Areas irrigated by surface water began greening 45 days after groundwater‐irrigated areas, which allowed separation of surface and groundwater irrigation in the classification. The fraction of each class area irrigated was determined using three different methods: ground truth data, a linear regression model calibrated to agricultural census data, and visual interpretation of Landsat TM imagery. Irrigated fractions determined by the three methods varied least for the double‐cropped irrigated class (0.62–0.79) and rangeland (0.00–0.02), and most for the minor irrigated class (0.06–0.43). Small irrigated patches (<0.1 km2) accounted for more irrigated area than all major surface water irrigated areas combined. The irrigated fractions of the minor and groundwater‐irrigated classes differed widely by method, suggesting that mapping patchy and small irrigated areas remains challenging, but comparison of multiple data sources improves confidence in the classification and highlights areas requiring more intensive fieldwork.","10.1080/01431160600851801","6.0","Trent Biggs; Prasad S.

"Outage Probability Analysis of IRS-Assisted Systems Under Spatially Correlated Channels","This letter investigates the impact of spatial channel correlation on the outage probability of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted single-input single-output (SISO) communication systems. In particular, we derive a novel closed-form expression of the outage probability for arbitrary phase shifts and correlation matrices of the indirect channels. To shed light on the impact of the spatial correlation, we further attain the closed-form expressions for two common scenarios met in the literature when the large-scale fading coefficients are expressed by the loss over a propagation distance. Numerical results validate the tightness and effectiveness of the closed-form expressions. Furthermore, the spatial correlation offers significant decreases in the outage probability as the direct channel is blocked.","10.1109/lwc.2021.3082409","6.0","Trinh Van Chien; Anastasios Papazafeiropoulos; Lam-Thanh Tu; Ribhu Chopra; Symeon Chatzinotas; Björn Ottersten","2021.0","","","outage; probability; irs; assisted; systems; channels"
"Diurnal primate densities and biomass in the Kakamega Forest: An evaluation of census methods and a comparison with other forests","Line-transect surveys were conducted at the Isecheno study site in the Kakamega Forest, western Kenya to estimate diurnal primate densities. The estimates from several different methods of analysis of census data were compared to ""true"" density values based on home range size and overlap for two species. The Whitesides method [Whitesides et al., 1988], which incorporates species-specific mean group spread into its formula for estimating transect width, provided the most accurate density estimates. The importance of including as many groups as possible when calculating density from home range size and overlap is demonstrated with long-term data from Colobus guereza and Cercopithecus mitis. Colobus guereza group density at Isecheno was much lower than that published from a recent brief study [von Hippel, 1996]. Cercopithecus mitis group density has fallen while overall population biomass appears to have remained stable over 20 years of study. Isecheno has the second highest diurnal primate biomass of the ten Guineo-Congolian rainforest sites for which biomass data are available, despite having the lowest primate species richness. Within the Guineo-Congolian rainforest system, primate biomass appears to vary to some extent between ecogeographic regions: two of three mid-elevation East African sites have high biomasses, two of two lowland West African sites have intermediate biomasses, and four of five lowland Central African sites have low biomasses. There is a strong positive correlation between total colobine biomass and total primate biomass at the ten Guineo-Congolian rainforest sites.","10.1002/(sici)1098-2345(200002)50:2","2.0","Peter J.

"Estimation of Population Coverage in the 1990 United States Census Based on Demographic Analysis","Abstract This article presents estimates of net coverage of the national population in the 1990 census, based on the method of demographic analysis. The general techniques of demographic analysis as an analytic tool for coverage measurement are discussed, including use of the demographic accounting equation, data components, and strengths and limitations of the method. Patterns of coverage displayed by the 1990 estimates are described, along with similarities or differences from comparable demographic estimates for previous censuses. The estimated undercount in the 1990 census was 4.7 million, or 1.85%. The undercount of males (2.8%) was higher than for females (.9%), and the undercount of Blacks (5.7%) exceeded the undercount of Non-Blacks (1.3%). Black adult males were estimated to have the highest rate of undercounting of all groups. Race-sex-age patterns of net coverage in the 1990 census were broadly similar to patterns in the 1980 and 1970 censuses. A final section presents the results of the first statistical assessment of the uncertainty in the demographic coverage estimates for 1990.","10.1080/01621459.1993.10476375","4.0","J.

"Trawling or Visual Censuses? Methodological Bias in the Assessment of Fish Populations in Seagrass Beds","Abstract. Fishes associated with the seagrass Posidonia oceanica were censused both by skid trawl and visual counts around Ischia Island, Italy. Both sampling procedures were performed during the day in summer and in winter at two sites. Significant differences in the number of species, number of individuals, biomass, and trophic structure of the fish assemblage were observed between sampling methods. Fewer fish species were recorded by visual counts than by trawling. More individuals and a greater biomass, however, were recorded from visual counts. The population of macrocarnivores (Scorpaenidae, Serranidae) were better estimated by trawling, as were canopy‐dwellers (Syngnathidae; Symphodus rostratus) and benthic species (Gobiidae; Blenniidae; Bothidae). Conversely, good swimmers ( Sparidae; Coris julis, Symphodus spp.), and planktivorous fishes (Centracanthidae, Pomacentridae) mostly escaped the trawl and were better assessed by visual counts. The importance of methodological biases differed from one season to the other and was higher in summer than in winter. Particular attention should be paid to the biases induced by sampling techniques when interpreting data, and different sampling methods should be used to accurately study the fish assemblages of seagrass meadows.","10.1111/j.1439-0485.1992.tb00338.x","2.0","Mireille Harmelin‐Vivien; Patrice Francour","1992.0","","","censuses; methodological; bias; fish; populations; seagrass; beds"
"An Analysis of the Mixed Collection Modes for two Business Surveys Conducted by the US Census Bureau","In the past decade, offering multiple modes of data collection has become increasingly popular. However, the benefits of offering multiple modes should not come at the cost of data quality. Using historic data from two federal business surveys, we investigate data quality as a function of mode of data collection using various quality measures, including the unit response rate (the unweighted proportion of responding reporting units) and the quantity response rate (the weighted proportion of an estimate obtained from reported data).","10.1093/poq/nfv013","3.0","Katherine Jenny Thompson; Broderick E.

"Census 2: isobaric labeling data analysis","We introduce Census 2, an update of a mass spectrometry data analysis tool for peptide/protein quantification. New features for analysis of isobaric labeling, such as Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) or Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantification (iTRAQ), have been added in this version, including a reporter ion impurity correction, a reporter ion intensity threshold filter and an option for weighted normalization to correct mixing errors. TMT/iTRAQ analysis can be performed on experiments using HCD (High Energy Collision Dissociation) only, CID (Collision Induced Dissociation)/HCD (High Energy Collision Dissociation) dual scans or HCD triple-stage mass spectrometry data. To improve measurement accuracy, we implemented weighted normalization, multiple tandem spectral approach, impurity correction and dynamic intensity threshold features.Census 2 supports multiple input file formats including MS1/MS2, DTASelect, mzXML and pepXML. It requires JAVA version 6 or later to run.

"Evaluation of the Pellet Group Count as a Deer Census Method","Reliable estimates of deer numbers are basic to effective deer herd management. Michigan's first large scale any-deer season in 1952 led to intensive study of available methods of estimating deer population levels. Results of some experimental investigations concerning the potential value of pellet group counts as a deer census method are presented here. The method was described by Bennett, English, and McCain (1940) and has been subsequently used by a number of investigators. However, only a limited amount of checking has been done on basic assumptions. Perhaps one of the best possible checks on the method lies in its application to an area containing a known deer population. The purpose of this paper is to report such a test and initial results of studies concerning daily defecation rates and rates of pellet deterioration.","10.2307/3797250","2.0","Lee Eberhardt; Robert C.

"Muscle damage impairs insulin stimulation of IRS-1, PI 3-kinase, and Akt-kinase in human skeletal muscle","Physiological stress associated with muscle damage results in systemic insulin resistance. However, the mechanisms responsible for the insulin resistance are not known; therefore, the present study was conducted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms associated with insulin resistance after muscle damage. Muscle biopsies were obtained before (base) and at 1 h during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (40 mU · kg −1 · min −1 ) in eight young (age 24 ± 1 yr) healthy sedentary (maximal O 2 consumption, 49.7 ± 2.4 ml · kg −1 · min −1 ) males before and 24 h after eccentric exercise (ECC)-induced muscle damage. To determine the role of cytokines in ECC-induced insulin resistance, venous blood samples were obtained before (control) and 24 h after ECC to evaluate ex vivo endotoxin-induced mononuclear cell secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1β. Glucose disposal was 19% lower after ECC ( P &lt; 0.05). Insulin-stimulated insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was 45% lower after ECC ( P &lt; 0.05). Insulin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, Akt (protein kinase B) serine phosphorylation, and Akt activity were reduced 34, 65, and 20%, respectively, after ECC ( P &lt; 0.05). TNF-α, but not IL-6 or IL-1β production, increased 2.4-fold 24 h after ECC ( P &lt; 0.05). TNF-α production was positively correlated with reduced insulin action on PI 3-kinase ( r = 0.77, P = 0.04). In summary, the physiological stress associated with muscle damage impairs insulin stimulation of IRS-1, PI 3-kinase, and Akt-kinase, presumably leading to decreased insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Although more research is needed on the potential role for TNF-α inhibition of insulin action, elevated TNF-α production after muscle damage may impair insulin signal transduction.","10.1152/ajpendo.2000.279.1.e206","8.0","Luis F.

"Limit on the LMC mass from a census of its satellites","We study the orbits of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies in the combined presence of the Milky Way and LMC and we find 6 dwarfs which were likely accreted with the LMC (Car 2, Car 3, Hor 1, Hyi 1, Phe 2, Ret 2), in addition to the SMC, representing strong evidence of dwarf galaxy group infall. This procedure depends on the gravitational pull of the LMC, thus allowing us to place a lower bound on the Cloud's mass of $M_{\rm LMC} > 1.24\times10^{11} M_\odot$. This mass estimate is validated by applying the technique to a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy with an LMC analogue where we find that while this lower bound may be overestimated, it will improve in the future with smaller observational errors. We apply this technique to dwarf galaxies lacking radial velocities and find that Eri 3 has a broad range of radial velocities for which it has a significant chance ($> 0.4$) of having being bound to the Cloud. We study the non-Magellanic classical satellites and find that Fornax has an appreciable probability of being an LMC satellite if the LMC is sufficiently massive. In addition, we explore how the orbits of the Milky Way satellites change in the presence of the LMC and find a significant change for several objects. Finally, we find that the LMC satellites are slightly smaller than the Milky Way satellites at a fixed luminosity, possibly due to the different tidal environments they have experienced.","10.1093/mnras/staa1238","2.0","Denis Erkal; Vasily Belokurov","2020.0","","","limit; lmc; mass; census; satellites"
"A Black Hole in the Galactic Center Complex IRS 13E?","The IRS 13E complex is an unusual concentration of massive, early-type stars at a projected distance of ~0.13 pc from the Milky Way's central supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Because of their similar proper motion and their common nature as massive, young stars, it has recently been suggested that IRS 13E may be the remnant of a massive stellar cluster containing an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) that binds its members gravitationally in the tidal field of Sgr A*. Here, we present an analysis of the proper motions in the IRS 13E environment that combines the currently best available data with a time line of 10 years. We find that an IMBH in IRS 13E must have a minimum mass of ~104 M☉ in order to bind the source complex gravitationally. This high-mass limit in combination with the absence so far of compelling evidence for a nonthermal radio and X-ray source in IRS 13E make it appear unlikely that an IMBH exists in IRS 13E that is sufficiently massive to bind the system gravitationally.","10.1086/431307","5.0","R.

"IRS-1 and IRS-2 are recruited by TrkA receptor and oncogenic TRK-T1","TRK-T1 oncogene is generated by the rearrangement of the NGF receptor TrkA with TPR. This gives rise to the constitutive tyrosine autophosphorylation and activation of the kinase. To study TRK-T1 oncogenic signaling and compare it to that induced by the genuine receptor TrkA, we investigated the involvement of IRS-1, a docking protein implicated in mitogenic signaling induced by several growth factors, in TRK-T1 and TrkA signaling. Here, we show that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are phosphorylated on tyrosine in presence of both TRK-T1 and the activated TrkA receptor. These tyrosine phosphorylations lead to IRS-1- and IRS-2-induced recruitment of p85PI3K, SHP-2, and Grb2 and increase in PI 3–kinase activity associated with IRS-1. Furthermore, we found that TRK-T1 is able to activate c-fos serum responsive element in cooperation with IRS-1 and IRS-2. We observed that TRK-T1 stimulates DNA synthesis in wild-type fibroblasts but not in IRS-1−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts. Yeast two-hybrid system experiments showed the occurrence of direct interaction between TRK and IRS molecules, which suggests involvement of different modes of interactions. On the whole, our results suggest that IRS-1 and IRS-2 could be substrates of TRK-T1 and TrkA, and hence could participate in their signal generation. J. Cell.

"A RESOLVED CENSUS OF MILLIMETER EMISSION FROM TAURUS MULTIPLE STAR SYSTEMS","We present a high angular resolution millimeter-wave dust continuum imaging survey of circumstellar material associated with individual components of 23 multiple star systems in the Taurus-Auriga young cluster. Combined with previous measurements, these new data permit a comprehensive look at how millimeter luminosity (a tracer of disk mass) relates to the separation and mass of a stellar companion. Approximately one third (28-37%) of individual stars in multiples have detectable millimeter emission, a rate half that for single stars (~62%). There is a strong correlation between the luminosity and projected separation (a_p) of a stellar pair. Wide pairs (a_p > 300 AU) have a similar luminosity distribution as single stars, medium pairs (a_p ~ 30-300 AU) are a factor of 5 fainter, and close pairs (a_p < 30 AU) are ~ 5 times fainter yet (aside from a small population of bright circumbinary disks). In most cases, the emission is dominated by a disk around the primary (or a wide tertiary in triples), but there is no clear relationship between luminosity and stellar mass ratio. A direct comparison of resolved disk sizes with predictions from tidal truncation models yields mixed results; some disks are larger than expected given their companion separations. We suggest that the presence of a stellar companion impacts disk properties at a level comparable to the internal evolution mechanisms operating in isolated systems, with both the multiple star formation process itself and star-disk tidal interactions likely playing important roles in the evolution of disk material. From the perspective of the mass content of the disk, we expect that (giant) planet formation is inhibited around the components of close pairs or secondaries, but should be as likely as for single stars around the primaries (or wide tertiaries in hierarchical triples) in more widely-separated multiple star systems.","10.1088/0004-637x/751/2/115","4.0","Robert J.

"Impact of Natural IRS-1 Mutations on Insulin Signals: Mutations of IRS-1 in the PTB Domain and Near SH2 Protein Binding Sites Result in Impaired Function at Different Steps of IRS-1 Signaling","Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is one of the major substrates of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and mediates various insulin signals downstream. In this study, we have examined the impact of three natural IRS-1 mutations identified in NIDDM patients (G971R, P170R, and M209T) on insulin signaling. G971R is located near src homology 2 protein binding sites, and P170R and M209T are located in the phosphotyrosine binding domain of IRS-1. 32D-IR cells, stably overexpressing human insulin receptor, were transfected with wild-type human IRS-1 cDNA (WT) or three mutant IRS-1 cDNAs and analyzed. All the cell lines expressing mutant IRS-1 showed a significant reduction in [3H]thymidine incorporation compared with WT. Upon insulin stimulation, cells expressing G971R showed a 39% decrease (P < 0.005) in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity, a 43% decrease (P < 0.01) in binding of the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, and a 22% decrease (P < 0.05) in mitogen-activated protein kinase activity compared with those expressing WT. Cells expressing P170R and M209T showed slight but significant decreases in PI 3-kinase activity (17 and 14%, respectively; both P < 0.05) and in binding of p85 (22 and 16%, respectively; both P < 0.05) and a greater decrease in mitogen-activated protein kinase activity (41 and 43%, respectively; both P < 0.005) compared with WT. After insulin stimulation, cells expressing P170R and M209T showed significant decreases in IRS-1 phosphorylation (37 and 42%, respectively; both P < 0.05) and in IRS-1 binding to the insulin receptor (48 and 53%, respectively; P < 0.01) compared with WT. G971R showed no changes in IRS-1 phosphorylation and in IRS-1 binding to the insulin receptor compared with WT. These data suggest that the impaired mitogenic response of P170R and M209T was mainly due to reduced binding to the insulin receptor, whereas the impaired response of G971R was mainly due to reduced association with PI 3-kinase p85.","10.2337/diab.46.6.929","12.0","Ryohei Yoshimura; Eiichi Araki; Sachiko Ura; M.

"The Preliminary Demography of the 2001 Census of India","This note presents and comments on the provisional results of the 2001 census of India. For the first time since Independence in 1947 there is clear evidence that the country's intercensal rate of population growth has fallen significantly—from an average annual rate of 2.14 percent between 1981 and 1991 to a rate of 1.93 percent between 1991 and 2001. At the state level there has been little change in the rates of population growth in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, but there are signs of—often quite considerable—reductions in growth rates for most of the remaining states. The provisional census results suggest that there has been a decline in India's population masculinity compared to 1991. But the note contends that this decline is probably largely spurious because females were less fully enumerated in 1991 than they were in 2001. Indeed the sex ratios of the states of Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, and Gujarat have become noticeably more masculine, which may partly reflect the influence of sex‐selective abortion.","10.1111/j.1728-4457.2001.00341.x","1.0","Tim Dyson","2001.0","","","preliminary; demography; census; india"

Propene adsorption complex with zinc sites (π-complex) and σ-allylzinc species as intermediates have been identified in the course of propane conversion to aromatics. The mechanism leading to the formation of methane and ethane, which are constituents of an undesirable route in propane conversion, has been examined by kinetic modeling of the expected reaction network based on in situ 1H MAS NMR kinetic measurements of the reaction performance. The pathways for propane aromatization and hydrogenolysis have been proposed. Hydrogenolysis of propane has been concluded to occur with the involvement of both Brønsted acid sites and Zn sites.","10.1021/jp103580f","4.0","Anton A. Gabrienko; Sergei S. Arzumanov; D.

"Joint Transmit and Reflective Beamforming for IRS-Assisted Integrated Sensing and Communication","This paper studies an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, in which one IRS with a uniform linear array (ULA) is deployed to not only assist the wireless communication from a multi-antenna base station (BS) to a single-antenna communication user (CU), but also create virtual line-of-sight (LoS) links for sensing potential targets at areas with LoS links blocked. We consider that the BS transmits combined information and sensing signals for ISAC. Under this setup, we jointly optimize the transmit information and sensing beamforming at the BS and the reflective beamforming at the IRS, to maximize the IRS's minimum beampattern gain towards the desired sensing angles, subject to the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirement at the CU and the maximum transmit power constraint at the BS. Although the formulated SNR-constrained beampattern gain maximization problem is non-convex and difficult to solve, we present an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution by using the techniques of alternating optimization and semi-definite relaxation (SDR). Numerical results show that the proposed joint beamforming design achieves improved sensing performance while ensuring the communication requirement as compared to benchmarks without such joint optimization. It is also shown that the use of dedicated sensing beams is beneficial in enhancing the performance for IRS-assisted ISAC.","10.1109/wcnc51071.2022.9771801","6.0","Xianxin Song; Ding Zhao; Haocheng Hua; Tony Xiao Han; Xun Yang; Jie Xu","2022.0","","","transmit; reflective; beamforming; irs; assisted; integrated; sensing; communication"
"A CENSUS OF OXYGEN IN STAR-FORMING GALAXIES: AN EMPIRICAL MODEL LINKING METALLICITIES, STAR FORMATION RATES, AND OUTFLOWS","In this contribution we present the first census of oxygen in star-forming galaxies in the local universe. We examine three samples of galaxies with metallicities and star formation rates at z = 0.07, 0.8 and 2.26, including the SDSS and DEEP2 surveys. We infer the total mass of oxygen produced and mass of oxygen found in the gas-phase from our local SDSS sample. The star formation history is determined by requiring that galaxies evolve along the relation between stellar mass and star formation rate observed in our three samples. We show that the observed relation between stellar mass and star formation rate for our three samples is consistent with other samples in the literature. The mass-metallicity relation is well established for our three samples and from this we empirically determine the chemical evolution of star-forming galaxies. Thus, we are able to simultaneously constrain the star formation rates and metallicities of galaxies over cosmic time allowing us to estimate the mass of oxygen locked up in stars. Combining this work with independent measurements reported in the literature we conclude that the loss of oxygen from the interstellar medium of local star-forming galaxies is likely to be a ubiquitous process with the oxygen mass loss scaling (almost) linearly with stellar mass. We estimate the total baryonic mass loss and argue that only a small fraction of the baryons inferred from cosmological observations accrete onto galaxies.","10.1088/0004-637x/757/1/54","5.0","H.

"Survey error in measuring socio-economic risk factors of health status: a comparison of a survey and a census","Background Individuals of lower socio-economic status (SES) are less likely to participate in health surveys than individuals of a higher SES. It is, however, not known whether this difference in participation is associated with health status. This study sets out to assess whether a population health survey gives biased estimates of socio-economic inequalities in self-reported health. Methods We compared two independent cross-national data collections, a national health interview survey (n = 10 164) and a census (n = 8 491 528), both carried out in Belgium in 2001 and posing the same health question. We computed the prevalence ratios of poor subjective health among socio-economic groups. To estimate the bias, a relative odds ratio (ROR) was computed as the ratio of the survey prevalence ratio to the census prevalence ratio. Results Less-educated individuals had a lower risk of poor health status in the survey [Prevalence ratio = 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.48–1.86] than in the census (Prevalence ratio = 2.23) leading to an underestimation of the risk associated with low education (ROR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.66–0.83). Compared with better-off groups, those who were not working or who were less educated were generally less likely to participate in the survey when they had a poor health status. Conclusions Overall, the health survey underestimated the effects of low SES on poor health status, due to selection bias. We conclude that strategies to improve participation among disadvantaged socio-economic groups should be identified.","10.1093/ije/dym191","4.0","Vincent Lorant; Stefaan Demarest; Pieter-Jan Miermans; Herman Van Oyen","2007.0","","","survey; error; risk; factors; health; status; census"
"High-frequency data from the U.S. Census Bureau during the COVID-19 pandemic: small vs. new businesses","Small businesses experienced very sharp declines in activity, business sentiment, and expectations early in the pandemic. While there has been some recovery since then, multiple indicators of small business performance remained substantially in the negative range early in 2021. These findings are from a unique high frequency, real time, survey of small employer businesses, the Census Bureau's Small Business Pulse Survey (SBPS). In contrast, results from the high frequency, real time, Business Formation Statistics (BFS) show there has been a surge in new business applications following an initial decline. Most of these applications are for likely nonemployers; however, there has also been a surge in new applications for likely employers, especially in Retail Trade (and especially Non-store Retailers). We compare and contrast the patterns from these two new high frequency data products that provide novel insights into the distinct patterns of dynamics for existing small businesses relative to new business formations.","10.1057/s11369-021-00229-0","5.0","Catherine Buffington; Daniel Chapman; Emin Dinlersoz; Lucia Foster; John Haltiwanger","2021.0","","Small Business Pulse Survey","frequency; u; s; census; bureau; covid; businesses"

Based on China's own official estimates of demographic change, our intercensal analysis indicates a shortfall in enumeration of more than a quarter of all children under age 5 and an eighth of those between 5 and 9, a total of nearly 37 million children missing in the 2000 census. We show that the shortfall is primarily due to underreporting of children in the census. Sex differences in child underreporting were fairly minor. Child underreporting in China is not unprecedented, but child underreporting rates in 2000 were about triple those of previous censuses. We attribute the increase primarily to policy changes beginning in the early 1990s that held officials at all jurisdictional levels personally responsible for enforcing birth quotas.","10.1080/0032472042000272348","1.0","Daniel Goodkind","2004.0","","","china; s; children; census; surprise"

"Creating a surrogate commuter network from Australian Bureau of Statistics census data","Between the 2011 and 2016 national censuses, the Australian Bureau of Statistics changed its anonymity policy compliance system for the distribution of census data. The new method has resulted in dramatic inconsistencies when comparing low-resolution data to aggregated high-resolution data. Hence, aggregated totals do not match true totals, and the mismatch gets worse as the data resolution gets finer. Here, we address several aspects of this inconsistency with respect to the 2016 usual-residence to place-of-work travel data. We introduce a re-sampling system that rectifies many of the artifacts introduced by the new ABS protocol, ensuring a higher level of consistency across partition sizes. We offer a surrogate high-resolution 2016 commuter dataset that reduces the difference between the aggregated and true commuter totals from ~34% to only ~7%, which is on the order of the discrepancy across partition resolutions in data from earlier years.","10.1038/s41597-019-0137-z","3.0","Kristopher M.

"Women and social class: a methodological study comparing individual, household, and census measures as predictors of black/white differences in reproductive history.","STUDY OBJECTIVE--The aim was to compare four different measures of women9s social class (interview and census based) as predictors of well known social gradients in reproductive outcomes. The intent was to address two obstacles that confront research in the United States regarding social gradients in women9s health: how women9s social class should be measured, and the absence of socioeconomic data in most health records. STUDY DESIGN--The study was a retrospective cohort analysis, using a community based random sample. Setting--Alameda County, California, 1987. SUBJECTS--51 black and 50 white women, ages 20 to 80 years, identified by random digit dialling, were interviewed by telephone. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Census data were linked to individual records via the respondents9 addresses. Using number of full term pregnancies as an example, multiple linear regression analyses demonstrated that individual class was not significantly associated with this outcome, whereas household class was: women from non-working-class households had 0.8 fewer such pregnancies than women from working class households (95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.4, -0.1). The block group measure functioned most like the household class measure (beta = -0.7, 95% CI = -1.4, 0.1), while the census tract measure was non-significant (beta = -0.4, 95% CI = -1.2, 0.4). Similar results were obtained for the outcomes: age at first full term pregnancy, percent of early terminated pregnancies, and yearly income. CONCLUSIONS--These results suggest block group data may offer a uniform source of social class information that can be appended to individual health records, and that this strategy is not invalidated by concerns regarding ecological fallacy.","10.1136/jech.45.1.35","1.0","Nancy Krieger","1991.0","","","women; class; household; census; measures; predictors; differences; history"

The pure-silica MTW and BEA coatings synthesized in this study have not been previously reported. All coatings are continuous and have excellent adhesion. The as-synthesized zeolite coatings were tested by a dc polarization technique and found to be highly corrosion resistant in severely corrosive acidic (0.5 M aqueous solution) and alkaline (0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution) media. In particular, a pure-silica MFI coating of only a few hundreds of nanometers thickness was formed within a relatively short crystallization time (e.g., 15 min), and was shown to provide sufficient protection against corrosion. © 2002 The Electrochemical Society.

"A census of cool-core galaxy clusters in IllustrisTNG","The thermodynamic structure of hot gas in galaxy clusters is sensitive to astrophysical processes and typically difficult to model with galaxy formation simulations. We explore the fraction of cool-core (CC) clusters in a large sample of $370$ clusters from IllustrisTNG, examining six common CC definitions. IllustrisTNG produces continuous CC criteria distributions, the extremes of which are classified as CC and non-cool-core (NCC), and the criteria are increasingly correlated for more massive clusters. At $z=0$, the CC fractions for $2$ criteria are in reasonable agreement with the observed fractions but the other $4$ CC fractions are lower than observed. This result is partly driven by systematic differences between the simulated and observed gas fraction profiles. The simulated CC fractions with redshift show tentative agreement with the observed fractions, but linear fits demonstrate that the simulated evolution is steeper than observed. The conversion of CCs to NCCs appears to begin later and act more rapidly in the simulations. Examining the fraction of CCs and NCCs defined as relaxed we find no evidence that CCs are more relaxed, suggesting that mergers are not solely responsible for disrupting CCs. A comparison of the median thermodynamic profiles defined by different CC criteria shows that the extent to which they evolve in the cluster core is dependent on the CC criteria. We conclude that the thermodynamic structure of galaxy clusters in IllustrisTNG shares many similarities with observations, but achieving better agreement most likely requires modifications of the underlying galaxy formation model.","10.1093/mnras/sty2078","13.0","David J Barnes; Mark Vogelsberger; Rahul Kannan; Federico Marinacci; Rainer Weinberger; Volker Springel; Paul Torrey; Annalisa Pillepich; Dylan Nelson; Rüdiger Pakmor; Jill Naiman; Lars Hernquist; M.

"Comparison of the sociodemographic characteristics of the large NutriNet-Santé e-cohort with French Census data: the issue of volunteer bias revisited","Background A recurring concern in traditional and in Web-based studies pertains to non-representativeness due to volunteer bias. We investigated this issue in an ongoing, large population-based e-cohort. Methods The sample included 122 912 individuals enrolled in the Internet-based, nutrition-focused NutriNet-Santé study between May 2009 and March 2014, with complete baseline data. Participants were recruited via recurrent multimedia campaigns and other traditional and online strategies. Individuals aged 18+ years, residing in France and having Internet access, were eligible for enrolment. Their sociodemographic characteristics were compared with the corresponding 2009 Census data via χ 2 goodness-of-fit tests. The effectiveness of statistical weighting of the e-cohort data was also explored. Results The sample exhibited marked geographical and sociodemographic diversity, including volunteers belonging to typically under-represented subgroups in traditional surveys (unemployed, immigrants, the elderly). Nonetheless, the proportions of women, relatively well-educated individuals and those who are married or cohabiting, were notably larger compared with the corresponding national figures (women: 78.0% vs 52.4%; postsecondary education: 61.5% vs 24.9%; married or cohabiting: 70.8% vs 62.0%, respectively; all p&lt;0.0001).

"Single cell census of human kidney organoids shows reproducibility and diminished off-target cells after transplantation","Abstract Human iPSC-derived kidney organoids have the potential to revolutionize discovery, but assessing their consistency and reproducibility across iPSC lines, and reducing the generation of off-target cells remain an open challenge. Here, we profile four human iPSC lines for a total of 450,118 single cells to show how organoid composition and development are comparable to human fetal and adult kidneys. Although cell classes are largely reproducible across time points, protocols, and replicates, we detect variability in cell proportions between different iPSC lines, largely due to off-target cells. To address this, we analyze organoids transplanted under the mouse kidney capsule and find diminished off-target cells. Our work shows how single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) can score organoids for reproducibility, faithfulness and quality, that kidney organoids derived from different iPSC lines are comparable surrogates for human kidney, and that transplantation enhances their formation by diminishing off-target cells.","10.1038/s41467-019-13382-0","16.0","Ayshwarya Subramanian; Eriene-Heidi Sidhom; Maheswarareddy Emani; Katherine A.

"A Census of Optical and Near‐Infrared Selected Star‐forming and Passively Evolving Galaxies at Redshift<i>z</i>∼ 2","Using the extensive multi-wavelength data in the GOODS-North field, we construct and draw comparisons between samples of optical and near-IR selected star-forming and passively evolving galaxies at redshifts 1.42.3 galaxies (Distant Red Galaxies; DRGs) are very similar as a function of K, with K&lt;20 galaxies having ~120 Msun/yr, a factor of two to three higher than those with K&gt;20.5. The absence of X-ray emission from the reddest DRGs and BzK galaxies with z-K&gt;3 indicates they must have declining star formation histories to explain their red colors and low SFRs. While the M/L ratio of passively-evolving galaxies may be larger on average, the Spitzer/IRAC data indicate that their inferred stellar masses do not exceed the range spanned by optically selected galaxies, suggesting that the disparity in current SFR may not indicate a fundamental difference between optical and near-IR selected massive galaxies (M* &gt; 10^11 Msun). We consider the contribution of UGR, BzK, DRG, and submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) to the SFRD at z~2, taking into account sample overlap. The total SFRD in the interval 1.480% could be selected by the UGR, BzK, and/or DRG criteria.","10.1086/444588","6.0","Naveen A. Reddy; Dawn K. Erb; Charles C. Steidel; Alice E. Shapley; Kurt L.

"Land Cover Classification Using IRS LISS III Image and DEM in a Rugged Terrain: A Case Study in Himalayas","Abstract Digital image classification is generally performed to produce land cover maps from remote sensing data, particularly for large areas. The performance of image classifiers that utilize only the remote sensing data may deteriorate, especially in mountainous regions, due to the presence of shadows of high peaks. In this study, a multisource classification approach to map land cover in Himalayan region with high mountain peaks having elevations up to 4785 m above mean sea level has been adopted. Remote sensing data from IRS LISS III image along with NDVI and DEM data layers have been used to perform multi‐source classification using maximum likelihood classifier. The results show a substantial improvement in accuracy of classification on incorporation of NDVI and DEM as ancillary data over the classification performed solely on the basis of remote sensing data.","10.1080/10106040508542343","4.0","Ashis Kumar Saha; Manoj K.

"Divergent Roles of IRS (Insulin Receptor Substrate) 1 and 2 in Liver and Skeletal Muscle","IRS1 and IRS2 are the most important representatives of the IRS protein family and critical nodes in insulin/IGF1-signaling. Although they are quite similar in their structural and functional features they show tissue-specific differences. In this review, we outline the functions of IRS1 and IRS2 in skeletal muscle and liver with regard to their importance for metabolism, growth and differentiation. Mechanisms contributing to IRS1 and IRS2 dysregulation in disease states as well as consequences thereof are discussed. IRS1 plays the dominant role in skeletal muscle. It is crucial for normal growth and differentiation of myofibers, insulin-dependent glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis. The presence of IRS2 in skeletal muscle is negligible for insulin-induced glucose uptake and the general role of IRS2 in muscle is still not fully understood. In liver IRS1 and IRS2 are important to mediate insulindependent regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism and complement each other in the diurnal regulation thereof. IRS1 in the liver is more important for signaling in the late refeeding period, whereas IRS2 signaling is mostly dominating in the period directly after food intake and during fasting. Importantly, the expression level of IRS1 and IRS2 is different within the liver lobule, which could be an explanation for the phenomenon of selective insulin resistance. Dysregulated muscular or hepatic abundance and/or phosphorylation status of IRS1 and IRS2 are important factors in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and muscle wasting.","10.2174/0929867324666170426142826","3.0","Sabine S.

"An OVI Baryon Census of the Low-z Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium","Intergalactic absorbers along lines of sight to distant quasars are a powerful diagnostic for the evolution and content of the intergalactic medium (IGM). In this study, we use the FUSE satellite to search 129 known lya absorption systems at z&lt;0.15 toward 31 AGN for corresponding absorption from higher Lyman lines and the important metal ions OVI. We detect OVI in 40 systems over a smaller range of column density than seen in HI. The co-existence of OVI and HI suggests a multiphase IGM, with warm photoionized and hot ionized components. With improved OVI detection statistics, we find a steep distribution in OVI column density, dN(OVI)/dN_OVI N_OVI^(-2.2+-0.1), suggesting that numerous weak OVI absorbers contain baryonic mass comparable to the rare strong absorbers. The total cosmological mass fraction in this hot gas is at least Omega_WHIM=(0.0022+-0.0003. Gas in the WHIM at 10^5-6 K contributes at least 4.8+-0.9% of the total baryonic mass at z&lt;0.15. We then combine empirical scaling relations for the observed ""multiphase ratio"", N_HI/N_OVI N_HI^(0.9+-0.1), and for hydrogen overdensity in cosmological simulations, N_HI delta_H^{0.7}, with the HI photoionization correction to derive the mean oxygen metallicity, Z_O (0.09 Z_sun)(f_OVI/0.2)^(-1) in the low-z multiphase gas. Given the spread in the empirical relations and in f_OVI, the baryon content in the OVI WHIM could be as large as 10%. Our survey is based on a large improvement in the number of OVI absorbers (40 vs. 10) and total redshift pathlength (dz 2.2 vs. dz 0.5) compared to earlier surveys.","10.48550/arxiv.astro-ph/0501054","2.0","Charles Danforth; J.

"Internal migration and ethnic groups: evidence for Britain from the 2001 Census","Abstract Relatively little is known about the internal migration behaviour of different ethnic groups. This paper reviews existing evidence, and analyses 2001 Census data for Britain to provide an overview of patterns in the level of migration and the distance migrated, according to the characteristics of migrants and for diverse ethnic groups. Those who migrate in each ethnic group have similar characteristics, leading to the assertion that differences in levels of migration result mainly from differing socio‐economic and age compositions of ethnic groups. This is confirmed through regression analysis. Differences in distance migrated, however, are not explained by the composition of ethnic groups, but may be explained by their primarily urban current areas of residence. Exceptions to the general patterns are highlighted as avenues for further investigation.

"Refining the Census of the Upper Scorpius Association with Gaia*","Abstract We have refined the census of stars and brown dwarfs in the Upper Sco association (∼10 Myr, ∼145 pc) by (1) updating the selection of candidate members from our previous survey to include the high-precision astrometry from the second data release of Gaia, (2) obtaining spectra of a few hundred candidate members to measure their spectral types and verify their youth, and (3) assessing the membership (largely with Gaia astrometry) of 2020 stars toward Upper Sco that show evidence of youth in this work and previous studies. We arrive at a catalog of 1761 objects that are adopted as members of Upper Sco. The distribution of spectral types among the adopted members is similar to those in other nearby star-forming regions, indicating a similar initial mass function. In previous studies, we have compiled mid-infrared photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and the Spitzer Space Telescope for members of Upper Sco and used those data to identify the stars that show evidence of circumstellar disks; we present the same analysis for our new catalog of members. As in earlier work, we find that the fraction of members with disks increases with lower stellar masses, ranging from ≲10% for &gt;1 M ⊙ to ∼22% for 0.01–0.3 M ⊙ . Finally, we have estimated the relative ages of Upper Sco and other young associations using their sequences of low-mass stars in <?CDATA ${M}_{{G}_{\mathrm{RP}}}$?> versus G BP − G RP . This comparison indicates that Upper Sco is a factor of two younger than the β Pic association (21–24 Myr) according to both nonmagnetic and magnetic evolutionary models.","10.3847/1538-3881/ab9599","2.0","K.

"Respiratory intensive care units in Italy: a national census and prospective cohort study","<h3>BACKGROUND</h3> In Italy, respiratory intensive care units (RICUs) provide an intermediate level of care between the intensive care unit (ICU) and the general ward for patients with single organ respiratory failure. Because of the lack of official epidemiological data in these units, a two phase study was performed with the aim of describing the work profile in Italian RICUs. <h3>METHODS</h3> A national survey of RICUs was conducted from January to March 1997 using a questionnaire which comprised over 30 items regarding location, models of service provision, staff, and equipment. The following criteria were necessary for inclusion of a unit in the survey: (1) a nurse to patient ratio ranging from 1:2.5 to 1:4 per shift; (2) availability of adequate continuous non-invasive monitoring; (3) expertise for non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and for intubation in case of NIV failure; (4) physician availability 24 hours a day. Between November 1997 and January 1998 a 3 month prospective cohort study was performed to survey the patient population admitted to the RICUs. <h3>RESULTS</h3> Twenty six RICUs were included in the study: four were located in rehabilitation centres and 22 in general hospitals. In most, the reported nurse to patient ratio ranged from 1:2 to 1:3, with 36% of units reporting a ratio of 1:4 per shift. During the study period 756 consecutive patients of mean (SD) age 68 (12) years were admitted to the 26 RICUs. The highest proportion (47%) were admitted from emergency departments, 19% from other medical wards, 18% were transferred from the ICU, 13% from specialist respiratory wards, and 2% were transferred following surgery. All but 32 had respiratory failure on admission. The reasons for admission to the RICU were: monitoring for expected clinical instability (n=221), mechanical ventilation (n=473), and weaning (n=59); 586 patients needed mechanical ventilation during their stay in the RICU, 425 were treated with non-invasive techniques as a first line of treatment (374 by non-invasive positive pressure, 51 by iron lung), and 161 underwent invasive mechanical ventilation (63 intubated, 98 tracheostomies). All but 48 patients had chronic respiratory disease, mainly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; n=451). More than 70% of patients (n=228) had comorbidity, mainly consisting of heart disorders. The median APACHE II score was 18 (range 1–43). The predicted inpatient mortality risk rate according to the APACHE II equation was 22.1% while the actual inpatient mortality rate was 16%. The mean length of stay in the RICU was 12 (11) days. The outcome in most patients (79.2%) admitted to RICUs was favourable. <h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3> Italian RICUs are specialised units mainly devoted to the monitoring and treatment of acute on chronic respiratory failure by non-invasive ventilation, but also to weaning from invasive mechanical ventilation. The results of this study provide a useful insight into an increasingly important field of respiratory medicine.","10.1136/thorax.56.5.373","1.0","Marco Confalonieri","2001.0","","","respiratory; care; units; italy; census; cohort"
"Quality of 1980 census data for American Indians","Abstract The count of American Indians in the 1980 census was over 70 per cent larger than the 1970 census count. An assessment of the demographic basis for this change shows that the cohorts from ages 10 to 74 in 1980 increased by substantial amounts, reaching 35 per cent for many ages. Increases of this nature in the absence of immigration are demographically impossible—an indication that the changes in response patterns identified by Passel (1976) between the 1970 and 1960 censuses persisted in 1980, possibly at even greater levels. In addition to presenting demographic analyses of the American Indian data at the national level, this paper includes an analysis of geographic variation of implied birth, death, and migration rates at the state level. States which historically have had large American Indian populations in general had high birth and death rates with reasonable migration rates. Many other states, however, had anomalously low birth and death rates with extraordinarily high implied migration rates. This pattern suggests that the changes in response may have occurred primarily in the latter areas. Several other anomalies in the American Indian data are reported here. The sample figure for American Indians from the 1980 census exceeds the complete count by more than 8 per cent at the national level. Increases occurred in most states, but the amount of increase varied substantially. Also, the increases tend to occur outside American Indian areas (reservations, tribal trust lands, etc.). Such differences are, for the most part, outside of expected sample variability. Furthermore, differences in the number of persons reporting American Indian race and American Indian ancestry were substantial. Some of the causes of these differences are investigated here. The paper concludes with an overall assessment of the quality and utility of these census data for various types of analysis.","10.1080/19485565.1986.9988637","2.0","Jeffrey S. Passel; Patricia A.

"The Neutron Star Census","The paucity of old isolated accreting neutron stars in ROSAT observations is used to derive a lower limit on the mean velocity of neutron stars at birth. The secular evolution of the population is simulated following the paths of a statistical sample of stars for different values of the initial kick velocity, drawn from an isotropic Gaussian distribution with mean velocity 0 ≤ ⟨V⟩ ≤ 550 km s-1. The spin-down, induced by dipole losses and by the interaction with the ambient medium, is tracked together with the dynamical evolution in the Galactic potential, allowing for the determination of the fraction of stars which are, at present, in each of the four possible stages: ejector, propeller, accretor, and georotator. Taking from the ROSAT All Sky Survey an upper limit of ~10 accreting neutron stars within ~140 pc from the Sun, we infer a lower bound for the mean kick velocity, ⟨V⟩ ≳ 200-300 km s-1, corresponding to a velocity dispersion σV ≳ 125-190 km s-1. The same conclusion is reached for both a constant magnetic field (B ~ 1012 G) and a magnetic field decaying exponentially with a timescale ~109 yr. Such high velocities are consistent with those derived from radio pulsar observations. Present results, moreover, constrain the fraction of low-velocity stars, which could have escaped pulsar statistics, to less than 1%.","10.1086/308408","6.0","С. Б. Попов; Monica Colpi; A. Treves; R.

"Jurisdictional, socioeconomic and gender inequalities in child health and development: analysis of a national census of 5-year-olds in Australia","Objectives Early child development may have important consequences for inequalities in health and well-being. This paper explores population level patterns of child development across Australian jurisdictions, considering socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Design Census of child development across Australia. Setting and participants Teachers complete a developmental checklist, the Australian Early Development Index (AEDI), for all children in their first year of full-time schooling. Between May and July 2009, the AEDI was collected by 14 628 teachers in primary schools (government and non-government) across Australia, providing information on 261 147 children (approximately 97.5% of the estimated 5-year-old population). Outcome measures Level of developmental vulnerability in Australian children for five developmental domains: physical well-being, social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills and communication skills and general knowledge. Results The results show demographic and socioeconomic inequalities in child development as well as within and between jurisdiction inequalities. The magnitude of the overall level of inequality in child development and the impact of covariates varies considerably both between and within jurisdiction by sex. For example, the difference in overall developmental vulnerability between the best-performing and worst-performing jurisdiction is 12.5% for males and 7.1% for females. Levels of absolute social inequality within jurisdictions range from 8.2% for females to 12.7% for males. Conclusions The different mix of universal and targeted services provided within jurisdictions from pregnancy to age 5 may contribute to inequality across the country. These results illustrate the potential utility of a developmental census to shed light on the impact of differences in universal and targeted services to support child development by school entry.","10.1136/bmjopen-2012-001075","12.0","Sally Brinkman; Angela Gialamas; Azizur Rahman; Murthy Mittinty; Tess Gregory; Sven Silburn; Sharon Goldfeld; Stephen R.

"IRS-Assisted Wireless Powered NOMA: Do We Really Need Different Phase Shifts in DL and UL?","Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising technology to improve the performance of wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs) due to its capability to reconfigure signal propagation environments via smart reflection. In particular, the high passive beamforming gain promised by IRS can significantly enhance the efficiency of both downlink wireless power transfer (DL WPT) and uplink wireless information transmission (UL WIT) in WPCNs. Although adopting different IRS phase shifts for DL WPT and UL WIT, i.e., dynamic IRS beamforming, is in principle possible but incurs additional signaling overhead and computational complexity, it is an open problem whether it is actually beneficial. To answer this question, we consider an IRS-assisted WPCN where multiple devices employ a hybrid access point (HAP) to first harvest energy and then transmit information using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Specifically, we aim to maximize the sum throughput of all devices by jointly optimizing the IRS phase shifts and the resource allocation. To this end, we first prove that dynamic IRS beamforming is not needed for the considered system, which helps reduce the number of IRS phase shifts to be optimized. Then, we propose both joint and alternating optimization based algorithms to solve the resulting problem. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs over benchmark schemes and also provide useful insights into the importance of IRS for realizing spectrum and energy efficient WPCNs.","10.1109/lwc.2021.3072502","3.0","Qingqing Wu; Xiaobo Zhou; Robert Schober","2021.0","","","irs; assisted; wireless; powered; noma; do; really; need; different; phase; shifts; dl; ul"

"Sampling and the Politics of Representation in US Census 2000","Counting of people in official censuses and other social surveys produces representations that are arguably of far greater political importance than the representations produced by voting. The recent controversy around the use of sampling methods in US Census 2000 illustrates some important political-geographical dimensions of our decisions regarding whether and how to be counted in surveys. The argument is intended both to illuminate political features of this very important source of geographical data and to encourage a more self-consciously political engagement with the statisitical surveys through which modern citizens more or less consciously contribute to the shaping of our own lives.","10.1068/d289","1.0","Matthew G.

"Two Kinds of Framework Al Sites Studied in BEA Zeolite by X-ray Diffraction, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, NMR Techniques, and V Probe","The dealumination of BEA zeolite by treatment with concentrated nitric acid is evidenced by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Two-dimensional 27Al 3Q and 5Q magic-angle-spinning (MAS) NMR allow the detection of two kinds of tetrahedral Al atoms whose relative amounts depend on the Si/Al ratio and which correspond to two specific T-sites. 29Si MAS NMR and 1H MAS NMR measurements confirm these results. 29Si MAS NMR spectra evidence two resonances at around −114 and −111 ppm ascribed to Si sites of the Si(OSi)4 environment of two different crystallographic sites. Moreover, the presence of Si atoms associated with hydroxyl groups is confirmed by a resonance at −102 ppm when 1H−29Si CP is applied. The Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites in dealuminated BEA zeolites are evidenced by FTIR spectra of adsorbed pyridine which show two kinds of bridging hydroxyl groups (Si−O(H)−Al) of different acid strength. 51V MAS NMR confirms the incorporation of vanadium atoms into vacant T-atom sites of a fully dealuminated SiBEA zeolite leading to two kinds of tetrahedral V(V) sites (δiso = – 708 and – 766 ppm), with a V=O double bond and linked by V−OSi bonds to the framework. The two types of tetrahedral V(V) sites are in line with the two kinds of tetrahedral Al sites initially present in the zeolite. Moreover, the two bands at 3620 and 3645 cm−1 suggest that VSiBEA also contains V(V) sites with V(V)O−H groups, which exhibit Brønsted acidic character as shown by FTIR of adsorbed pyridine. Possible ways for the formation of tetrahedral V(V) in the BEA structure are proposed.","10.1021/jp808356q","5.0","Redouane Hajjar; Yannick Millot; Pascal P.

"Active IRS Aided Multiple Access for Energy-Constrained IoT Systems","In this paper, we investigate the fundamental multiple access (MA) scheme in an active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided energy-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) system, where an active IRS is deployed to assist the uplink transmission from multiple IoT devices to an access point (AP). Our goal is to maximize the sum throughput by optimizing the IRS beamforming vectors across time and resource allocation. To this end, we first study two typical active IRS aided MA schemes, namely time division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), by analytically comparing their achievable sum throughput and proposing corresponding algorithms. Interestingly, we prove that given only one available IRS beamforming vector, the NOMA-based scheme generally achieves a larger throughput than the TDMA-based scheme, whereas the latter can potentially outperform the former if multiple IRS beamforming vectors are available to harness the favorable time selectivity of the IRS. To strike a flexible balance between the system performance and the associated signaling overhead incurred by more IRS beamforming vectors, we then propose a general hybrid TDMA-NOMA scheme with device grouping, where the devices in the same group transmit simultaneously via NOMA while devices in different groups occupy orthogonal time slots. By controlling the number of groups, the hybrid TDMA-NOMA scheme is applicable for any given number of IRS beamforming vectors available. Despite of the non-convexity of the considered optimization problem, we propose an efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization, where each subproblem is solved optimally. Simulation results illustrate the practical superiorities of the active IRS over the passive IRS in terms of the coverage extension and supporting multiple energy-limited devices, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed hybrid MA scheme for flexibly balancing the performance-cost tradeoff.","10.1109/twc.2022.3206332","6.0","Guangji Chen; Qingqing Wu; Chong He; Wen Chen; Jie Tang; Shi Jin","2022.0","","","irs; aided; multiple; access; energy; constrained; iot; systems"
"Downregulation of IRS-1 in adipose tissue of offspring of obese mice is programmed cell-autonomously through post-transcriptional mechanisms","We determined the effects of maternal diet-induced obesity on offspring adipose tissue insulin signalling and miRNA expression in the aetiology of insulin resistance in later life. Although body composition and glucose tolerance of 8-week-old male offspring of obese dams were not dysregulated, serum insulin was significantly (p<0.05) elevated. Key insulin signalling proteins in adipose tissue were down-regulated, including the insulin receptor, catalytic (p110β) and regulatory (p85α) subunits of PI3K as well as AKT1 and 2 (all p<0.05). The largest reduction observed was in IRS-1 protein (p<0.001), which was regulated post-transcriptionally. Concurrently, miR-126, which targets IRS-1, was up-regulated (p<0.05). These two features were maintained in isolated primary pre-adipocytes and differentiated adipocytes in-vitro. We have therefore established that maternal diet-induced obesity programs adipose tissue insulin resistance. We hypothesise that maintenance of the phenotype in-vitro strongly suggests that this mechanism is cell autonomous and may drive insulin resistance in later life.","10.1016/j.molmet.2014.01.007","8.0","Denise S.

"The IRS-signalling system in insulin and cytokine action","IRS-signalling proteins are engaged and phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by the receptors for insulin and IGF-1, and various classes of cytokine receptors, including IL-4, IL-9, and IL-13; IFNα/β and IFNγ; and growth hormone and LIF. IRS-proteins provide an interface between these receptors and signalling proteins which contain Src homology-2 domains (SH2-proteins). The recent identification of IRS-2 provides new insight into the modular structure and function of the IRS-proteins. The IRS-proteins provide a means for signal amplification by eliminating the stoichiometric constraints encountered by most receptors which directly recruit SH2-proteins to their autophosphorylation sites. Moreover, IRSproteins dissociate the intracellular signalling complex from the endocytic pathways of the activated receptor. The shared use of IRS-proteins by multiple receptors is likely to reveal important connections between various hormones and cytokines that were previously unrecognized, or observed but unexplained. The existence of additional signalling molecules based on the IRS-paradigm is likely.","10.1098/rstb.1996.0015","1.0","Morris F. White","1996.0","","","irs; signalling; insulin; cytokine; action"
"THE CENSUS OF COMPLEX ORGANIC MOLECULES IN THE SOLAR-TYPE PROTOSTAR IRAS16293-2422","Complex organic molecules (COMs) are considered to be crucial molecules, since they are connected with organic chemistry, at the basis of terrestrial life. More pragmatically, they are molecules which in principle are difficult to synthesize in harsh interstellar environments and, therefore, are a crucial test for astrochemical models. Current models assume that several COMs are synthesized on lukewarm grain surfaces (≳30–40 K) and released in the gas phase at dust temperatures of ≳100 K. However, recent detections of COMs in ≲20 K gas demonstrate that we still need important pieces to complete the puzzle of COMs formation. Here, we present a complete census of the oxygen- and nitrogen-bearing COMs, previously detected in different Interstellar Medium (ISM) regions, toward the solar-type protostar IRAS16293-2422. The census was obtained from the millimeter–submillimeter unbiased spectral survey TIMASSS. Of the 29 COMs searched for, 6 were detected: methyl cyanide, ketene, acetaldehyde, formamide, dimethyl ether, and methyl formate. Multifrequency analysis of the last five COMs provides clear evidence that they are present in the cold (≲30 K) envelope of IRAS16293-2422, with abundances of 0.03–2 × 10−10. Our data do not allow us to support the hypothesis that the COMs abundance increases with increasing dust temperature in the cold envelope, as expected if COMs were predominately formed on lukewarm grain surfaces. Finally, when also considering other ISM sources, we find a strong correlation over five orders of magnitude between methyl formate and dimethyl ether, and methyl formate and formamide abundances, which may point to a link between these two couples of species in cold and warm gas.","10.1088/0004-637x/791/1/29","4.0","A.

"IRS-Assisted Green Communication Systems: Provable Convergence and Robust Optimization","In this paper, we investigate resource allocation for IRS-assisted green multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. To minimize the total transmit power, both the beamforming vectors at the access point (AP) and the phase shifts at multiple IRSs are jointly optimized, while taking into account the minimum required quality-of-service (QoS) of multiple users. First, two novel algorithms, namely a penalty-based alternating minimization (AltMin) algorithm and an inner approximation (IA) algorithm, are developed to tackle the non-convexity of the formulated optimization problem when perfect channel state information (CSI) is available. Existing designs employ semidefinite relaxation in AltMin-based algorithms, which, however, cannot ensure convergence. In contrast, the proposed penalty-based AltMin and IA algorithms are guaranteed to converge to a stationary point and a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution of the design problem, respectively. Second, the impact of imperfect knowledge of the CSI of the channels between the AP and the users is investigated. To this end, a non-convex robust optimization problem is formulated and the penalty-based AltMin algorithm is extended to obtain a stationary solution. Simulation results reveal a key trade-off between the speed of convergence and the achievable total transmit power for the two proposed algorithms. In addition, we show that the proposed algorithms can significantly reduce the total transmit power at the AP compared to various baseline schemes and that the optimal numbers of transmit antennas and IRS reflecting elements, which maximize the system energy efficiency of the considered system, are finite.","10.1109/tcomm.2021.3087794","4.0","Xianghao Yu; Dongfang Xu; Derrick Wing Kwan Ng; Robert Schober","2021.0","","","irs; assisted; green; communication; systems; provable; convergence; robust; optimization"

This essay describes the techniques used in the MPC's linking program and briefly compares this technique with those used by other researchers. The key feature of the MPC linking method is the construction of cumulative name similarity scores, based on approximately 2.5 billion record comparisons; we also use support vector mechanics to classify potential links.

"Measuring US fertility using administrative data from the Census Bureau","Longitudinal data available for studying fertility in the United States are not representative at the state level, limiting analyses of subnational variation in US fertility. The US Census Bureau makes available restricted data that may be used for measuring fertility, but the data have not previously been described for a scholarly audience or used for fertility research.This paper describes and analyzes restricted-use administrative birth data available through the Census Numident for nearly all US births for more than the last century. Within these data, most births since 1997 are linked to parents through the Census Household Composition Key (CHCK). These analyses are designed to illustrate the scope and limitations of these data for the study of US fertility.We describe the creation and content of the Census Numindent and CHCK data sets and compare the data to published US vital statistics. We also analyze the geographic coverage of both data sets and compare the demographic composition of the new data sources to national demographic composition. We further illustrate how these novel data sources may be used by comparing them to survey responses at the individual level.This paper describes an underutilized source of national US data for studying fertility, shows the quality of these data by performing analyses, and explains how scholars can access these data for research.","10.4054/demres.2022.47.2","3.0","Katie R.

"Respiratory intensive care units in Italy: a national census and prospective cohort study","<h3>BACKGROUND</h3> In Italy, respiratory intensive care units (RICUs) provide an intermediate level of care between the intensive care unit (ICU) and the general ward for patients with single organ respiratory failure. Because of the lack of official epidemiological data in these units, a two phase study was performed with the aim of describing the work profile in Italian RICUs. <h3>METHODS</h3> A national survey of RICUs was conducted from January to March 1997 using a questionnaire which comprised over 30 items regarding location, models of service provision, staff, and equipment. The following criteria were necessary for inclusion of a unit in the survey: (1) a nurse to patient ratio ranging from 1:2.5 to 1:4 per shift; (2) availability of adequate continuous non-invasive monitoring; (3) expertise for non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and for intubation in case of NIV failure; (4) physician availability 24 hours a day. Between November 1997 and January 1998 a 3 month prospective cohort study was performed to survey the patient population admitted to the RICUs. <h3>RESULTS</h3> Twenty six RICUs were included in the study: four were located in rehabilitation centres and 22 in general hospitals. In most, the reported nurse to patient ratio ranged from 1:2 to 1:3, with 36% of units reporting a ratio of 1:4 per shift. During the study period 756 consecutive patients of mean (SD) age 68 (12) years were admitted to the 26 RICUs. The highest proportion (47%) were admitted from emergency departments, 19% from other medical wards, 18% were transferred from the ICU, 13% from specialist respiratory wards, and 2% were transferred following surgery. All but 32 had respiratory failure on admission. The reasons for admission to the RICU were: monitoring for expected clinical instability (n=221), mechanical ventilation (n=473), and weaning (n=59); 586 patients needed mechanical ventilation during their stay in the RICU, 425 were treated with non-invasive techniques as a first line of treatment (374 by non-invasive positive pressure, 51 by iron lung), and 161 underwent invasive mechanical ventilation (63 intubated, 98 tracheostomies). All but 48 patients had chronic respiratory disease, mainly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; n=451). More than 70% of patients (n=228) had comorbidity, mainly consisting of heart disorders. The median APACHE II score was 18 (range 1–43). The predicted inpatient mortality risk rate according to the APACHE II equation was 22.1% while the actual inpatient mortality rate was 16%. The mean length of stay in the RICU was 12 (11) days. The outcome in most patients (79.2%) admitted to RICUs was favourable. <h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3> Italian RICUs are specialised units mainly devoted to the monitoring and treatment of acute on chronic respiratory failure by non-invasive ventilation, but also to weaning from invasive mechanical ventilation. The results of this study provide a useful insight into an increasingly important field of respiratory medicine.","10.1136/thorax.56.5.373","1.0","Marco Confalonieri","2001.0","","","respiratory; care; units; italy; census; cohort"

"A three‐dimensional eddy census of a high‐resolution global ocean simulation","A three‐dimensional eddy census data set was obtained from a global ocean simulation with one‐tenth degree resolution and a duration of 7 years. The census includes 6.7 million eddies in daily data, which comprise 152,000 eddies tracked over their lifetimes, using a minimum lifetime cutoff of 28 days. Variables of interest include eddy diameter, thickness (vertical extent), minimum and maximum depth, location, rotational direction, lifetime, and translational speed. Distributions of these traits show a predominance of small, thin, short‐lived, and slow eddies. Still, a significant number of eddies possess traits at the opposite extreme; thousands of eddies larger than 200 km in diameter appeared in daily data each year. A tracking algorithm found hundreds of eddies with lifetimes longer than 200 days. A third of the eddies are at least 1000 m tall and many penetrate the full depth of the water column. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current contains the thickest and highest density of eddies. Thick eddies are also common in the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio Current, and Agulhas ring pathway. The great majority of eddies extend all the way to the surface, confirming that eddy censuses from surface observations are a good proxy for the full‐depth ocean. Correlations between variables show that larger‐diameter eddies tend to be thicker and longer lived than small eddies.","10.1002/jgrc.20155","5.0","Mark Petersen; Sean Williams; Mathew Maltrud; Matthew Hecht; Bernd Hamann","2013.0","","","census; resolution; ocean; simulation"
"Structure, Stability, and Lewis Acidity of Mono and Double Ti, Zr, and Sn Framework Substitutions in BEA Zeolites: A Periodic Density Functional Theory Study","The siting of Ti, Sn, and Zr framework heteroatoms in zeolite BEA and the resulting Lewis acidity were systematically investigated by periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Mono as well as double substitutions were considered. Substitution of Si by Ti, Sn, or Zr in the lattice of BEA zeolite is not random. For all substituted zeolites, the introduction of heteroatoms at the T2 crystallographic position is preferred. Water adsorption was used as a probe for Lewis acidity of lattice sites in these substituted zeolites. Although the Lewis acidity of Sn- and Zr-substituted BEA zeolites is generally quite similar, it is substantially higher than that of Ti–BEA. The Lewis acidity of substituted zeolites strongly depends on the crystallographic location of the heteroatoms. For those lattice sites that can be approached from two different directions, interaction with water will be favored from the more accessible direction. Stable structures containing double lattice substitutions at distances below 5.0 Å are found in Sn–BEA but not in Ti– or Zr–BEA. It is argued that substituted heteroatoms play an important role during the activation of reactants, with their ability to activate them depending on the type of heteroatom. The presence of paired lattice sites in Sn–BEA zeolite substantially enhances Lewis acidity of the zeolites, which clearly distinguishes Sn–BEA from its Ti- and Zr-substituted analogues.","10.1021/jp310433r","3.0","Gang Yang; Evgeny A.

"LEAF DEMOGRAPHY AND PHENOLOGY IN AMAZONIAN RAIN FOREST: A CENSUS OF 40 000 LEAVES OF 23 TREE SPECIES","The periodicity, synchrony, and causes of variability in the demography of tree leaves in ecosystems with relatively aseasonal climates, such as tropical rain forests, is still poorly understood. To address this issue, we surveyed the timing of birth and death of >40 000 leaves of 1445 individuals of 23 evergreen rain forest species in several late primary and early secondary successional plant communities at San Carlos de Rio Negro, Venezuela, in the northern Amazon basin. In all species, the mortality rate generally increased with leaf age. However, in many species, deceleration of death rates with extreme leaf age was noted. In general, for each species, the age structure of leaf populations and the frequency distribution of leaf life span were broad. Species differed substantially in their leaf demography. Measured in their native habitats, seven species common to disturbed open sites had shorter median life spans (0.7 yr) than five species common to open but infertile Bana primary communities (1.9 yr average) or six species common to two tall primary forest communities (Tierra Firme and Caatinga), when measured in high-light conditions in the canopy (2.0 yr average). Variation in light availability had consistent effects on leaf life span in all species. Species native to Tierra Firme forest had average leaf life spans of 3.2, 1.9, and 1.6 yr, respectively, in deeply shaded understory microsites, in small gaps, and in sunlit mature tree canopies. Species native to Caatinga forest had average leaf life spans of 4.2, 3.4, and 2.5 yr, respectively, in these same microsite types. Two species common in gaps and in disturbed sites had much longer leaf life span in shaded understory than in open, disturbed microsites. For all species, responses were similar when trees were planted in sites differing in light availability, as when trees naturally established across light gradients. The rate of leaf production, the risk of leaf mortality, and the leaf life span were not periodic or related consistently to seasonality of climate. Negligible relationships existed between the mild annual dry season and either leaf production or leaf mortality in all species. Thus, leaf phenology and demography were essentially aseasonal in this tropical forest environment.","10.1890/02-4047","5.0","Peter B. Reich; Christopher Uhl; Michael B. Walters; Laura R.

"A Census of Actively Licensed Physicians in the United States, 2014","Marked changes have occurred in health care delivery in the United States with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including the advancement of integrated health systems, the introduction of patient centered medical homes and the creation of accountable care organizations. With millions of Americans newly insured, never has there been a more pressing need for accurate physician workforce information and planning. Opinions vary about the nature and degree of anticipated physician shortages, and health care workforce determinations are fraught with variables and uncertainties that are challenging to address definitively. Identifying accurate information about the nation's currently licensed physician workforce, however, is an important starting point. This article reviews data received in 2014 by the Federation of State Medical Boards from the nation's state medical and osteopathic boards about the current supply of actively licensed physicians in the United States and the District of Columbia. Our census data demonstrates the total population of licensed physicians (916,264) has increased by 4% since 2012, and the nation, on average, added 12,168 more licensed physicians annually than it lost. The average physician is now older (by a year), predominantly male (but increasingly female at entry level) and increasingly a graduate of a medical school in the Caribbean. Meanwhile, the percentage of physicians with a single state medical license has remained constant at 79%.","10.30770/2572-1852-101.2.7","6.0","Aaron Young; Humayun J.

"On the Performance of IRS-Assisted Multi-Layer UAV Communications With Imperfect Phase Compensation","This work presents the symbol error rate (SER) and outage probability analysis of multi-layer unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) wireless communications assisted by intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS). In such systems, the UAVs may experience high jitter, making the estimation and compensation of the end-to-end phase for each propagation path prone to errors. Consequently, the imperfect phase knowledge at the IRS should be considered. The phase error is modeled using the von Mises distribution and the analysis is performed using the Sinusoidal Addition Theorem (SAT) to provide accurate results when the number of reflectors <inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$L\leq 3$ </tex-math></inline-formula> , and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) when <inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$L\geq 4$ </tex-math></inline-formula> . The achieved results show that accurate phase estimation is critical for IRS based systems, particularly for a small number of reflecting elements. For example, the SER at 10 <sup xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">−3</sup> degrades by about 5 dB when the von Mises concentration parameter <inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\kappa =2$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$L=30$ </tex-math></inline-formula> , but the degradation for the same <inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\kappa $ </tex-math></inline-formula> surges to 25 dB when <inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$L=2$ </tex-math></inline-formula> . The air-to-air (A2A) channel for each propagation path is modeled as a single dominant line-of-sight (LoS) component, and the results are compared to the Rician channel.

"Census of solo LuxR genes in prokaryotic genomes","luxR genes encode transcriptional regulators that control acyl homoserine lactone-based quorum sensing (AHL QS) in Gram negative bacteria. On the bacterial chromosome, luxR genes are usually found next or near to a luxI gene encoding the AHL signal synthase. Recently, a number of luxR genes were described that have no luxI genes in their vicinity on the chromosome. These so-called solo luxR genes may either respond to internal AHL signals produced by a non-adjacent luxI in the chromosome, or can respond to exogenous signals. Here we present a survey of solo luxR genes found in complete and draft bacterial genomes in the NCBI databases using HMMs. We found that 2698 of the 3550 luxR genes found are solos, which is an unexpectedly high number even if some of the hits may be false positives. We also found that solo LuxR sequences form distinct clusters that are different from the clusters of LuxR sequences that are part of the known luxR-luxI topological arrangements. We also found a number of cases that we termed twin luxR topologies, in which two adjacent luxR genes were in tandem or divergent orientation. Many of the luxR solo clusters were devoid of the sequence motifs characteristic of AHL binding LuxR proteins so there is room to speculate that the solos may be involved in sensing hitherto unknown signals. It was noted that only some of the LuxR clades are rich in conserved cysteine residues. Molecular modeling suggests that some of the cysteines may be involved in disulfide formation, which makes us speculate that some LuxR proteins, including some of the solos may be involved in redox regulation.","10.3389/fcimb.2015.00020","7.0","Sanjarbek Hudaiberdiev; Kumari Sonal Choudhary; Roberto Vera Alvarez; Zsolt Gelencsér; Balázs Ligeti; Doriano Lamba; Sándor Pongor","2015.0","","","census; solo; luxr; genes; genomes"
"Modeling the IRS Telephone Taxpayer Information System","The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) toll-free, nationwide telephone system provides prompt tax-information assistance. In 1986, the IRS processed 37.8 million calls from taxpayers at 32 answering sites. This paper documents a critical review of the IRS approach to allocating its staff and equipment. We built a simulation-based model to test various allocation policies for deploying IRS resources. The simulation study included detailed sensitivity analysis on key network variables, and showed the feasibility of modeling a typical IRS location as a multiserver loss/delay queue with retrial and reneging. The second phase of this effort therefore centered around developing a prototype probabilistic model for determining the most effective way of providing service at reasonable levels and at minimum cost. The resulting model allows the IRS to determine from tables the best configuration of people and telephone lines for any expected levels of incoming traffic. In addition, we provided flow balance analyses of the underlying feedback queues that permit the IRS to separate their caller streams into fresh and repeat callers, and thus to estimate actual demand for service.","10.1287/opre.35.4.504","3.0","Carl M.

"<i>SPITZER</i>/IRS 5-35 μm LOW-RESOLUTION SPECTROSCOPY OF THE 12 μm SEYFERT SAMPLE","We present low-resolution 5.5–35 μm spectra for 103 galaxies from the 12 μm Seyfert sample, a complete unbiased 12 μm flux limited sample of local Seyfert galaxies selected from the IRAS Faint Source Catalog, obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on-board Spitzer Space Telescope. For 70 of the sources observed in the IRS mapping mode, uniformly extracted nuclear spectra are presented for the first time. We performed an analysis of the continuum emission, the strength of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and astronomical silicate features of the sources. We find that on average, the 15–30 μm slope of the continuum is 〈α15−30〉 = −0.85 ± 0.61 for Seyfert 1s and −1.53 ± 0.84 for Seyfert 2s, and there is substantial scatter in each type. Moreover, nearly 32% of the Seyfert 1s, and 9% of the Seyfert 2s, display a peak in the mid-infrared spectrum at 20 μm, which is attributed to an additional hot dust component. The PAH equivalent width decreases with increasing dust temperature, as indicated by the global infrared color of the host galaxies. However, no statistical difference in PAH equivalent width is detected between the two Seyfert types, 1 and 2, of the same bolometric luminosity. The silicate features at 9.7 and 18 μm in Seyfert 1 galaxies are rather weak, while Seyfert 2s are more likely to display strong silicate absorption. Those Seyfert 2s with the highest silicate absorption also have high infrared luminosity and high absorption (hydrogen column density NH > 1023 cm−2) as measured from the X-rays. Finally, we propose a new method to estimate the active galactic nucleus contribution to the integrated 12 μm galaxy emission, by subtracting the ""star formation"" component in the Seyfert galaxies, making use of the tight correlation between PAH 11.2 μm luminosity and 12 μm luminosity for star-forming galaxies.","10.1088/0004-637x/701/1/658","5.0","Yanling Wu; V.

"Measuring US fertility using administrative data from the Census Bureau","Background: Longitudinal data available for studying fertility in the United States are not representative at the state level, limiting analyses of subnational variation in US fertility. The US Census Bureau makes available restricted data that may be used for measuring fertility, but the data have not previously been described for a scholarly audience or used for fertility research. Objective: This paper describes and analyzes restricted-use administrative birth data available through the Census Numident for nearly all US births for more than the last century. Within these data, most births since 1997 are linked to parents through the Census Household Composition Key (CHCK). These analyses are designed to illustrate the scope and limitations of these data for the study of US fertility. Methods: We describe the creation and content of the Census Numindent and CHCK data sets and compare the data to published US vital statistics. We also analyze the geographic coverage of both data sets and compare the demographic composition of the new data sources to national demographic composition. We further illustrate how these novel data sources may be used by comparing them to survey responses at the individual level. Contribution: This paper describes an underutilized source of national US data for studying fertility, shows the quality of these data by performing analyses, and explains how scholars can access these data for research","10.4054/demres.2022.47.2","3.0","Amanda Stevenson; Joshua Sanders; Katie Genadek","2022.0","","","us; fertility; census; bureau"
"Essays on Firm Financing, Investment, and Growth","This dissertation studies the relationship between firm financing, investment, and growth. Chapter 1 makes use of a unique dataset that combines ownership data, Census Bureau data, and patenting data to study whether firms held by owners with more diversified business interests engage in more growth-enhancing risky innovation. I document that higher owner diversification leads to riskier innovation, after taking into account firm life cycle characteristics, access to finance, other features of ownership structure, and inherent firm and owner characteristics. I also provide evidence that diversification matters at the sector level, with sectors characterized by higher diversification exhibiting higher risky innovation, revenue, volatility, and growth. I present a stylized model that rationalizes these empirical findings. Chapter 2 studies the financial leverage of U.S. firms over their life-cycle and the implications of leverage for firm growth and response to shocks using a new dataset that combines private firms' balance sheets with Census Bureau data. We show that firm age and size are good predictors of leverage for private firms but not for publicly-listed ones. Using the Great Recession as a shock to financial conditions, we show that during the Great Recession leverage declines for private, but not public firms. We also provide evidence that private firms' growth is positively associated with leverage, while public firms' growth is not. Chapter 3 explores the extent to which interest rate fluctuations during sudden stops contribute to resource misallocation and explain the sharp decline in productivity observed during these episodes. Using firm-level data from Chile, I show evidence of rising misallocation during the 1998 sudden stop and evidence of hiring and investment frictions that could trigger this rising dispersion and subsequent decline in productivity. I then study the contribution of interest rate level and volatility shocks to this rise in misallocation using a small open economy model featuring heterogeneous firms that are subject to non-convex capital and labor adjustment frictions and calibrated using firm-level data from Chile. The model is qualitatively consistent with the rise in dispersion of marginal products and the decline in productivity observed during the sudden stop crisis","10.13016/dzku-skkv","1.0","Penciakova; Veronika","2019.0","","","essays; firm; financing; investment; growth"
"Evaluating the Accuracy of 2020 Census Block-Level Estimates in California","In this study, we provide an assessment of data accuracy from the 2020 Census. We compare block-level population totals from a sample of 173 census blocks in California across three sources: (1) the 2020 Census, which has been infused with error to protect respondent confidentiality; (2) the California Neighborhoods Count, the first independent enumeration survey of census blocks; and (3) projections based on the 2010 Census and subsequent American Community Surveys. We find that, on average, total population counts provided by the U.S. Census Bureau at the block level for the 2020 Census are not biased in any consistent direction. However, subpopulation totals defined by age, race, and ethnicity are highly variable. Additionally, we find that inconsistencies across the three sources are amplified in large blocks defined in terms of land area or by total housing units, blocks in suburban areas, and blocks that lack broadband access","10.1215/00703370-11075209","9.0","Beltrán-Sánchez; Hiram; Bozick; Robert; Brand; Jennie E; Burgette; Lane F; Kofner; Aaron; Sharygin; Ethan; Shih; Regina A; Tzen; Michael; Weidmer; Beverly","2023.0","","","accuracy; census; block; estimates; california"
"Comparison of personal income inequality estimates based on data from the IRS and Census Bureau","This paper demonstrates quantitatively that modern estimates of income inequality based on the data reported by the IRS are not reliable. Principal problem of the IRS data consists in highly volatile income estimates in the low-end of personal income distribution. This volatility is likely related to measurement errors, changes in definitions or improper reporting. Personal income estimates at high and the highest incomes are robust and follow the Pareto law. At high incomes, personal income distributions for 1990 and 2004, when normalized to total population with income and total (gross) personal income, practically coincide. Hence, the inequality estimates based on the IRS data are distorted by inaccurate readings in the low-income zone. At the same time, income data provided by the US Census Bureau are consistent over time in all income ranges. Results presented by Kitov (2007) demonstrate that personal income distributions based on readings obtained in the Current Population Survey are characterized by practically constant Gini coefficient since 1960. This observation implies that normalized personal income distributions are also not changing with time","10.2139/ssrn.1021487","1.0","Kitov; Ivan","2007.0","","","income; inequality; estimates; irs; census; bureau"
"Essays on the Management and Organizational Practices Survey","This dissertation examines the role that management practices play in plant performance and addresses the many challenges that accompany efforts to measure accurately the adoption of management practices. I first provide background on a recent Census Bureau survey, the Management and Organizational Practices Survey (MOPS), which measures management and organizational practices at manufacturing plants in the United States. Economists have long hypothesized that management is an important component of firm success, but until recently, the study of management was confined to hypotheses, anecdotes, and case studies. Building upon the work of Bloom and Van Reenen (2007), the Census Bureau conducted the first-ever large-scale survey of management practices in the United States, the MOPS, for 2010. The Census Bureau conducted a second, enhanced version of the MOPS for 2015. Next, I use data from the MOPS 2010 to examine changes in establishment-level management practices at approximately 12,000 continuing establishments between 2005 and 2010. I find that within-establishment changes in productivity are correlated primarily with practices related to performance incentives, particularly performance bonus practices. I present evidence that plants use performance bonuses as a channel of wage adjustment during the Great Recession, which explains most of the within-plant correlation between structured management practices and productivity. That is, negative demand shocks during the Great Recession negatively affect both measured productivity and the availability of bonuses and manufacturing plants. There is limited evidence that changes in bonus practices for reasons other than demand shocks have an impact on plant outcomes over the period from 2005 to 2010. Finally, I present further background on the cognitive testing practices that the Census Bureau used to develop the MOPS. Because management is an intangible input into plant production functions, it is not as easily measured as conventional inputs such as labor or capital. Pretesting was essential to ensure that quality data was collected. The results of the pretesting process provide insight into how respondents interpret the MOPS questionnaire, including the questions related to bonus practices, which in turn influences the interpretation of the results presented in the preceding chapter","10.13016/m2g15tb71","1.0","Ohlmacher; Scott William","2017.0","","","essays; management; organizational; practices; survey"
"Earnings Inequality and Mobility Trends in the United States: Nationally Representative Estimates from Longitudinally Linked Employer-Employee Data","Using earnings data from the U.S. Census Bureau, this paper analyzes the role of the employer in explaining the rise in earnings inequality in the United States. We first establish a consistent frame of analysis appropriate for administrative data used to study earnings inequality. We show that the trends in earnings inequality in the administrative data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program are inconsistent with other data sources when we do not correct for the presence of misused SSNs. After this correction to the worker frame, we analyze how the earnings distribution has changed in the last decade. We present a decomposition of the year-to-year changes in the earnings distribution from 2004-2013. Even when simplifying these flows to movements between the bottom 20%, the middle 60% and the top 20% of the earnings distribution, about 20.5 million workers undergo a transition each year. Another 19.9 million move between employment and nonemployment. To understand the role of the firm in these transitions, we estimate a model for log earnings with additive fixed worker and firm effects using all jobs held by eligible workers from 2004-2013. We construct a composite log earnings firm component across all jobs for a worker in a given year and a non-firm component. We also construct a skill-type index. We show that, while the difference between working at a low- or middle-paying firm are relatively small, the gains from working at a top-paying firm are large. Specifically, the benefits of working for a high-paying firm are not only realized today, through higher earnings paid to the worker, but also persist through an increase in the probability of upward mobility. High-paying firms facilitate moving workers to the top of the earnings distribution and keeping them there","10.5281/zenodo.51603","3.0","Abowd; John M; McKinney; Kevin L.; Zhao; Nellie","2017.0","","","earnings; inequality; mobility; trends; united; states; estimates; longitudinally; linked; employer; employee"

"The Impact of the Gig-Economy on U.S. Labor Markets: Understanding the Role of Non-Employer Firms using Econometric Models and the Example of Uber","In this work, I provide quantitative responses to the questions of how the size and the growth of the gig-economy can be measured and how labor markets respond to the exposure to online platforms using data on non-employer firms from the U.S. Census Bureau and on the staggered market entry of Uber in different U.S. metropolitan areas. I find that non-employer firms experienced a growth by 60 % between 1999 and 2014 adding almost 9 million non-employer firms to the U.S. economy. I show that non-employer firms are tightly linked to the rise of independent work and are highly effected by the emergence of online platforms. Uber triggers an increase of 20 percentage points in non-employer firms relative to employment in the transportation sector 4 years after entering local labor markets. Furthermore, Uber’s market entry is associated with a 0.05 - 0.07 increase in non-employer share in the transportation sector. I demonstrate that the growth of non-employer firms between 2005 and 2014 is correlated with the growth in alternative work arrangements measured at the industry and state level by Katz and Krueger. I find that the rise of non-employer firms is not mechanically driven by differential industry or regional growth and that the number of gig-economy workers are at highest where unemployment is at highest. My results highlight the impact of the gig-economy on labor markets and provide evidence that the use of non-employer firms is relevant for measuring the gig-economy.&nbsp;In this work, I provide quantitative responses to the questions of how the size and the growth of the gig-economy can be measured and how labor markets respond to the exposure to online platforms using data on non-employer firms from the U.S. Census Bureau and on the staggered market entry of Uber in different U.S. metropolitan areas.

"New Directions in the Development of Population Estimates in the United States?","The advent of a continuously updated Master Area File (MAF) following the 2000 census represents an information resource that can be tapped for purposes of developing timely, cost-effective, and precise population estimates for even the smallest of geographical units (e.g., census blocks). We argue that the MAF can be enhanced (EMAF) for these purposes. In support of our argument we describe a set of activities needed to develop EMAF, each of which is well within the current capabilities of the U.S. Census Bureau and discuss various costs and benefits of each. We also describe how EMAF would provide population estimates containing a wide range of demographic (e.g., age, race, and sex) and socio-economic characteristics (e.g., educational attainment, income, and employment). As such, it could largely negate and eliminate the need for many of the traditional demographic methods of population estimation and possibly reduce the number of sample surveys. We identify important challenges that must be surmounted in order to realize EMAF and make suggestions for doing so. We conclude by noting that the idea of the EMAF could be of interest to other countries with MAF files and strong administrative records systems that, like the United States, are facing the challenge of producing good population information in the face of increasing census costs","10.1007/s11113-009-9164-3","61.0","A Coale; A Dharmalingam; A Hakanson; A Rogers; B Williams; C Popoff; C Suchindran; D Freedman; D Judson; D Judson; D Pittenger; D Swanson; D Swanson; D Swanson; D Swanson; D Swanson; David A.

"Neighborhood-Level Factors Contribute to Disparities in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Incidence in Texas","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Texas has the highest hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence rates in the continental United States, but these rates vary by race-ethnicity. We examined racial-ethnic disparities through a geospatial analysis of the social determinants of health. METHODS: Using data from the Texas Cancer Registry, we assembled 11,547 HCC cases diagnosed between 2011 and 2015 into Texas\u27s census tracts geographic units. Twenty-nine neighborhood measures representing demographics and socioeconomic, and employment domains were retrieved from the U.S. Census Bureau. We performed a series of aspatial and spatially weighted regression models to identify neighborhood-level characteristics associated with HCC risk. RESULTS: We found positive associations between HCC and proportion of population in census tracts that are Black or African American, Hispanic, over 60 years of age, in the construction industry, and in the service occupation but an inverse association with the proportion of population employed in the agricultural industry.

"The microdata analysis system at the U.S. Census Bureau","The U.S. Census Bureau has the responsibility to release high quality data products while maintaining the confidentiality promised to all respondents under Title 13 of the U.S. Code. This paper describes a Microdata Analysis System (MAS) that is currently under development, which will allow users to receive certain statistical analyses of Census Bureau data, such as crosstabulations and regressions, without ever having access to the data themselves. Such analyses must satisfy several statistical confidentiality rules; those that fail these rules will not be output to the user. In addition, the Drop q Rule, which requires removing a relatively small number of units before performing an analysis, is applied to all datasets. We describe the confidentiality rules and briefly outline an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Drop q Rule. We conclude with a description of other approaches to creating a system of this sort, and some directions for future research","10.1007/978-3-642-15838-4_21","6.0","DePersio; Michael; Freiman; Michael; Lucero; Jason; Singh; Lisa; You; Jiashen; Zayatz; Laura","2010.0","","","microdata; u; s; census; bureau"
"Modeling Endogenous Mobility in Earnings Determination","We evaluate the bias from endogenous job mobility in fixed-effects estimates of worker- and firm-specific earnings heterogeneity using longitudinally linked employer-employee data from the LEHD infrastructure file system of the U.S. Census Bureau. First, we propose two new residual diagnostic tests of the assumption that mobility is exogenous to unmodeled determinants of earnings. Both tests reject exogenous mobility. We relax the exogenous mobility assumptions by modeling the evolution of the matched data as an evolving bipartite graph using a Bayesian latent class framework. Our results suggest that endogenous mobility biases estimated firm effects toward zero. To assess validity, we match our estimates of the wage components to out-of-sample estimates of revenue per worker. The corrected estimates attribute much more of the variation in revenue per worker to variation in match quality and worker quality than the uncorrected estimates","10.1080/07350015.2017.1356727","3.0","Abowd; John M; McKinney; Kevin L; Schmutte; Ian M","2017.0","","","mobility; earnings; determination"
"Confidentiality Protection in the 2020 US Census of Population and Housing","In an era where external data and computational capabilities far exceed statistical agencies' own resources and capabilities, they face the renewed challenge of protecting the confidentiality of underlying microdata when publishing statistics in very granular form and ensuring that these granular data are used for statistical purposes only. Conventional statistical disclosure limitation methods are too fragile to address this new challenge. This article discusses the deployment of a differential privacy framework for the 2020 US Census that was customized to protect confidentiality, particularly the most detailed geographic and demographic categories, and deliver controlled accuracy across the full geographic hierarchy.Comment: Version 2 corrects a few transcription errors in Tables 2, 3 and 5.

"Silver lining of the water: The role of government relief assistance in disaster recovery","Combining three datasets, the Australian Longitudinal Census Panel of 2006 and 2011, engineering data on flood-water height, and administrative data on government relief assistance, we investigate whether and how the government’s post-disaster relief payments helped the economic recovery from riverine floods that struck the state of Queensland in Australia in 2010/11. Using a difference-in-differences methodology that compares the flooded areas with unflooded zones within Queensland whereby the flooded zones differed in their levels of flooding and the government’s relief assistance, we find that the government’s disaster relief assistance was effective in economic recovery, having led individuals residing in flooded areas with average flood height to experience a 3.4 percent rise in (self-reported) income following the disaster, relative to those individuals living in unflooded areas of the state. Our findings are robust to a battery of sensitivity tests, including migration, parallel trends, spatial spillovers, and possible confounders","10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2023.102436","3.0","Akbulut-Yuksel; Mevlude; Rahman; Muhammad Habibur; Ulubaşoğlu; Mehmet Ali","2023.0","","","silver; lining; water; government; relief; assistance; disaster; recovery"
"Trends in Up-To-Date Colorectal Cancer Screening Among U.S. Adults Aged 50-75 Years and Variations by Race/Ethnicity and U.S. Census Bureau Divisions","INTRODUCTION: Mortality rates from colorectal cancer have declined over the past decades owing to population-based life-saving screening interventions. However, screening inequalities continue among racial and ethnic minorities despite having a higher disease burden. In this study, we assessed the patterns of up-to-date colorectal cancer screening rates among racial/ethnic groups across the U.S. Census Bureau Divisions. METHODS: This population-based cross-sectional study used weighted data from 4 cycles of the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (2014, 2016, 2018, and 2020) of adults aged 50‒75 years without a previous diagnosis of colorectal cancer. The primary outcome was guideline-recommended up-to-date colorectal cancer screening. We used logistic regression models to examine temporal trends in up-to-date colorectal cancer screening from 2014 to 2020. In addition, we conducted detailed descriptive statistics of up-to-date screening rates, comparing trends in 2020 with those in 2014 overall by race/ethnicity and U.S. census divisions. RESULTS: The overall proportion of individuals with up-to-date colorectal cancer screening increased from 66.5% in 2014 to 72.5% in 2020 ( CONCLUSIONS: Although colorectal cancer screening rates improved over time, they fall short of the 80% target. Substantial racial/ethnic and geographic disparities remain. Future studies investigating the factors influencing these disparities are needed","10.1016/j.focus.2022.100055","5.0","Montealegre; Jane R; Oluyomi; Abiodun O; Rosales; Omar; Sokale; Itunu O; Thrift; Aaron P","2023.0","","","trends; up; date; colorectal; cancer; screening; u; s; adults; aged; years; variations; race; ethnicity; census; bureau; divisions"

"Making Differential Privacy Work for Census Data Users","The U.S. Census Bureau collects and publishes detailed demographic data about Americans which are heavily used by researchers and policymakers. The Bureau has recently adopted the framework of differential privacy in an effort to improve confidentiality of individual census responses. A key output of this privacy protection system is the Noisy Measurement File (NMF), which is produced by adding random noise to tabulated statistics. The NMF is critical to understanding any errors introduced in the data, and performing valid statistical inference on published census data. Unfortunately, the current release format of the NMF is difficult to access and work with. We describe the process we use to transform the NMF into a usable format, and provide recommendations to the Bureau for how to release future versions of the NMF. These changes are essential for ensuring transparency of privacy measures and reproducibility of scientific research built on census data.Comment: 9 pages, 2 figure","10.1162/99608f92.c3c87223","3.0","Imai; Kosuke; McCartan; Cory; Simko; Tyler","2023.0","","","differential; privacy; census; users"

"Views of European races among the research staff of the US Immigration Commission and the Census Bureau, ca. 1910","This paper discusses support for, and opposition to, racial classification of European immigrants among high-level researchers at both the United States Immigration Commission of 1907 - 11 (the Dillingham Commission) and the Census Bureau during those same years. A critical distinction must be made between the Commission members - political appointees who mostly supported some form of restriction at the time of their appointment - and the top research staff, whose views were remarkably wide ranging. Moreover, even staff members committed to a racialized outlook - such as Daniel Folkmar, author of the Commission's infamous Dictionary of Races and Peoples - deserve a closer look than historians have given them; for example, Folkmar and his superior on the staff had requested commentary from Franz Boas, who was then emerging as the most prestigious academic critic of racial theories (theories that assume group differences in behavior arise from biological endowments). Another feature of the narrative concerns the surprising number of staff who transferred from the Commission to the Census Bureau to work on the 1910 Census. Debates continued at the Bureau as well, this time over how to present the results of the new mother tongue question, which had been introduced to the Census questionnaire in response to pressure for a European race question. Indeed, Folkmar was also the chief author of the Census Bureau report on the mother-tongue data","10.2139/ssrn.1739718","1.0","Perlmann; Joel","2011.0","","","views; races; staff; us; immigration; commission; census; bureau"
"Mechanical Model of Personal Income Distribution","A microeconomic model is developed, which accurately predicts the shape of personal income distribution (PID) in the United States and the evolution of the shape over time. The underlying concept is borrowed from geo-mechanics and thus can be considered as mechanics of income distribution. The model allows the resolution of empirical and definitional problems associated with personal income measurements. It also serves as a firm fundament for definitions of income inequality as secondary derivatives from personal income distribution. It is found that in relative terms the PID in the US has not been changing since 1947. Effectively, the Gini coefficient has been almost constant during the last 60 years, as reported by the Census Bureau","10.2139/ssrn.1345790","1.0","Kitov; Ivan O.","2009.0","","","personal; income; distribution"

Most publicly quoted corporations traded in Europe and the British Empire, but most close (private) corporations operated in the US, which, until the 1940s, had more corporations per capita than anywhere else. The 83 countries surveyed here differed markedly in company numbers, corporate capital/GDP ratios, and average corporate size.

"The Use of Blended Data to Improve Public Assistance Programs: Results from a Partnership between the U.S. Census Bureau, USDA, and State Program Agencies","The Census Bureau is partnering with state public assistance agencies to acquire program participation data and estimate new statistics that deepen a state’s understanding of program participants and improve outreach efforts to those who are eligible but do not participate. In collaboration with the Economic Research Service and the Food and Nutrition Service within the United States Department of Agriculture, the Census Bureau obtains individual-level program participation administrative records (AR) data for three state programs, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary Aid for Needy Families (TANF), and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). The Census Bureau constructs a unique data set for each state program by linking the AR data to survey response data for the same individuals. These linked data enable the Census Bureau to model which survey respondents are eligible for program participation and also to observe which eligible individuals participate in the program. The Census Bureau then estimates eligibility and participation rates by a variety of demographic and economic characteristics and by county. The individual-level data also enable the Census Bureau to construct a statistical profile of eligible individuals and families that do not participate to assist state agencies with their outreach programs. All statistical results provided back to state agencies in table reports and data visualizations are reviewed to insure that individual identities are protected and not disclosed.

"Are Self-Participation Rates Predictive of Accuracy in the U.S. Census?","Metrics related to the U.S. Census have been widely available for several decades but there has been a dearth of studies examining the relationship among key metrics in the Census. This paper provides empirical evidence about the link between self-participation rates and census accuracy using data from the 1990, 2000, and 2010 U.S Censuses. The preponderance of the evidence shows lower self-participation rates are highly correlated with higher net undercounts and omissions rates for key socio-demographic groups and states. Nine out of 11 correlations examined in this paper are statistically significant and in the predicted direction. One key reason self-participation rates are associated with census accuracy is the fact that the population not captured in the self-participation operation goes into the households for the Nonresponse Followup (NRFU) operation. Census Bureau data show data collected in NRFU is not as accurate as that collected in self-response. The larger the share of data collected for a population that is collected in NFRU, the lower the quality of data for that group. The connection between self-participation rates and census accuracy mean the differential self-participation rates seen in the 2020 Census suggest patterns of net Census undercounts seen in the past are likely to be seen in the 2020 Census","10.11114/ijsss.v8i6.4967","1.0","P.

"Randomness Concerns When Deploying Differential Privacy","The U.S. Census Bureau is using differential privacy (DP) to protect confidential respondent data collected for the 2020 Decennial Census of Population & Housing. The Census Bureau's DP system is implemented in the Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) and requires a source of random numbers. We estimate that the 2020 Census will require roughly 90TB of random bytes to protect the person and household tables. Although there are critical differences between cryptography and DP, they have similar requirements for randomness. We review the history of random number generation on deterministic computers, including von Neumann's ""middle-square"" method, Mersenne Twister (MT19937) (previously the default NumPy random number generator, which we conclude is unacceptable for use in production privacy-preserving systems), and the Linux /dev/urandom device. We also review hardware random number generator schemes, including the use of so-called ""Lava Lamps"" and the Intel Secure Key RDRAND instruction. We finally present our plan for generating random bits in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment using AES-CTR-DRBG seeded by mixing bits from /dev/urandom and the Intel Secure Key RDSEED instruction, a compromise of our desire to rely on a trusted hardware implementation, the unease of our external reviewers in trusting a hardware-only implementation, and the need to generate so many random bits.Comment: 12 pages plus 2 pages bibliograph","10.1145/3411497.3420211","20.0","Boneh Dan; Das S.; Gutterman Z.; Hotz V.

"Are Census Omissions of Young Children Due to Respondent Misconceptions about the Census?","The United States Census Bureau acknowledges the systematic undercount of young children in censuses and widely used surveys. Despite the growing body of research to understand the scope and characteristics of undercounted young children, little is known about likely causes. Missing from the research are efforts to talk with respondents about possible reasons for young child omissions. This study addresses that shortcoming using data from an online survey asking 800 respondents with young children several questions related to children and the census. The results indicate that many respondents have doubts about including young children in the census count for their household. Only 82 percent of low-income parents of young children responded that they would include their young child in the census count for their household. This percentage was lower if children had weaker ties to a household. These survey results provide evidence that misconceptions and confusion about including young children in the census exist and could easily result in young child omissions. These findings warrant replication and suggest that significant changes in instructions are needed to dispel these respondent misconceptions","10.11114/ijsss.v8i6.4994","2.0","Griffin; Deborah H.; O'Hare; William P.","2020.0","","","are; census; omissions; young; children; due; respondent; misconceptions"
"Agency, contingency and census process: Observations of the 2006 Indigenous Enumeration Strategy in remote Aboriginal Australia","The Indigenous Enumeration Strategy (IES) of the Australian National Census of Population and Housing has evolved over the years in response to the perceived ‘difference’ of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations. Its defining characteristics are the use of locally recruited, mostly Indigenous collector interviewers, and the administration of a modified collection instrument in discrete Indigenous communities, mostly in remote Australia. The research reported here is unique. The authors, with the assistance of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, were able to follow the workings of the IES in the 2006 Census from the design of the collection instrument to the training of temporary census field staff at the Northern Territory’s Census Management Unit in Darwin, to the enumeration in four remote locations, through to the processing stage at the Data Processing Centre in Melbourne. This allowed the tracking of data from collection to processing, and an assessment of the effects of information flows on the quality of the data, both as input and output. This study of the enumeration involved four very different locations: a group of small outstation communities (Arnhem Land), a large Aboriginal township (Wadeye), an ‘open’ town with a majority Aboriginal population (Fitzroy Crossing), and the minority Aboriginal population of a major regional centre (Alice Springs). A comparison between these contexts reveals differences that reflect the diversity of remote Aboriginal Australia, but also commonalities that exert a powerful influence on the effectiveness of the IES, in particular very high levels of short-term mobility. The selection of sites also allowed a comparison between the enumeration process in the Northern Territory, where a time-extended rolling count was explicitly planned for, and Western Australia, where a modified form of the standard count had been envisaged. The findings suggest that the IES has reached a point in its development where the injection of ever-increasing resources into essentially the same generic set and structure of activities may be producing diminishing returns. There is a need for a new kind of engagement between the Australian Bureau of Statistics and local government and Indigenous community-sector organisations in remote Australia. The agency and local knowledge of Indigenous people could be harnessed more effectively through an ongoing relationship with such organisations, to better address the complex contingencies confronting the census process in remote Indigenous Australia","10.26530/oapen_458796","1.0","Morphy; Frances","2020.0","","","agency; contingency; census; observations; indigenous; enumeration; aboriginal; australia"

"Confidentiality considerations for use of social-spatial data on the social determinants of health: Sexual and reproductive health case study","Understanding whether and how the places where people live, work, and play are associated with health behaviors and health is essential to understanding the social determinants of health. However, social-spatial data which link a person and their attributes to a geographic location (e.g., home address) create potential confidentiality risks. Despite the growing body of literature describing approaches to protect individual confidentiality when utilizing social-spatial data, peer-reviewed manuscripts displaying identifiable individual point data or quasi-identifiers (attributes associated with the individual or disease that narrow identification) in maps persist, suggesting that knowledge has not been effectively translated into public health research practices. Using sexual and reproductive health as a case study, we explore the extent to which maps appearing in recent peer-reviewed publications risk participant confidentiality. Our scoping review of sexual and reproductive health literature published and indexed in PubMed between January 1, 2013 and September 1, 2015 identified 45 manuscripts displaying participant data in maps as points or small-population geographic units, spanning 26 journals and representing studies conducted in 20 countries. Notably, 56% (13/23) of publications presenting point data on maps either did not describe approaches used to mask data or masked data inadequately. Furthermore, 18% (4/22) of publications displaying data using small-population geographic units included at least two quasi-identifiers. These findings highlight the need for heightened education for researchers, reviewers, and editorial teams. We aim to provide readers with a primer on key confidentiality considerations when utilizing linked social-spatial data for visualizing results. Given the widespread availability of place-based data and the ease of creating maps, it is critically important to raise awareness on when social-spatial data constitute protected health information, best practices for masking geographic identifiers, and methods of balancing disclosure risk and scientific utility.

"What drives differences in management practices?","Partnering with the US Census Bureau, we implement a new survey of ""structured"" management practices in two waves of 35,000 manufacturing plants in 2010 and 2015. We fnd an enormous dispersion of management practices across plants, with 40 percent of this variation across plants within the same frm. Management practices account for more than 20 percent of the variation in productivity, a similar, or greater, percentage as that accounted for by R&D, ICT, or human capital. We fnd evidence of two key drivers to improve management. The business environment, as measured by right-to-work laws, boosts incentive management practices. Learning spillovers, as measured by the arrival of large ""Million Dollar Plants"" in the county, increases the management scores of incumbents","10.1257/aer.20170491","7.0","Bloom; Nicholas; Brynjolfsson; Erik; Foster; Lucia; Jarmin; Ron; Patnaik; Megha; Saporta-Eksten; Itay; Van Reenen; John","2019.0","","","differences; management; practices"
"Essays in Public Finance and State and Local Taxation","This dissertation is in the field of public finance and taxation, with a specialization in state and local taxation in the United States. In the first chapter, it is sought to understand how business taxation at the state level affects the rate of entry and exits of businesses—or business dynamism. In the second and third chapters, The topic is approached from a different angle, and the following question is asked ""how do economic shocks affect local taxation?"" with a specific focus on property taxes. Business dynamism has been linked to innovation and employment creation, yet there is little empirical research on the relationship between business taxation and business operations births and deaths. Using several identification strategies that consider the potential endogeneity between tax changes and local economic conditions, a negative effect of the state corporate tax on the entry of establishments and firms is documented: an increase in the top state corporate tax rate of one percentage point leads to a decline in the entry rate of about -1.5% to -3.5%. The effect on exits is positive but smaller (0.5%–1.5%) and usually not statistically significant. Further, the presence of spillovers across state borders at the county and census tract level was evaluated, and no evidence was found that they were significant or drove the main findings. However, it was found that spillovers can be large in areas in close proximity to the border—within five miles. In the second chapter, newly collected data on property tax rates, assessment values, and property tax levies were used to study the effect of falling home prices associated with the Great Recession on property tax revenues. The mechanical channel through which home values affected assessed values as well as the policy channel through which policymakers responded to changes in the tax base were teased out. It was found that the resilience of property tax revenues can be attributed to two main factors: a small correlation between home price changes and assessed values after 2007 and large increases in property tax rates in areas facing a negative shock in their tax base. It was found that the recession had a small but negative and lasting impact on the tax base. Negative shocks were offset by as much as 80%–85% in the long run, implying that a 10% decrease in the tax base led to only a 1.5% decline in property tax revenues. Rate limits seem to reduce the ability of policymakers to offset negative shocks in the tax base and lead to a bigger decline in revenues. Jurisdictions with a levy limit are much more likely to smooth out negative and positive shocks. How did exposure to robotization impact local revenues and public goods provision? In the third chapter, it is shown that exposure to robots leads to a decline in total revenues, driven by a large fall in tax revenues, specifically property taxes. Spending was found to be similarly affected, with expenditures on transport, capital outlays, and insurance and trust being primarily hit. The role of local autonomy, as defined by areas with functional home rule, as well as the role of property tax limits were investigated. It was found that the decline in taxes was less pronounced in areas with higher autonomy and more pronounced in areas with strict property tax limits.PHDEconomicsUniversity of Michigan, Horace H.

"Improving the Measurement of Poverty","This study estimates 2007 national poverty rates using an approach largely conceptualized by a 1995 National Academy of Sciences panel and similar to the supplemental poverty measure that will soon be produced by the U.S. Census Bureau. The study uses poverty thresholds based on expenditures for shelter, food, clothing, and utilities as well as a measure of family income that includes earnings, cash transfers, near-cash benefits, tax credits, and tax payments. The measure also accounts for child care, work, and out-of-pocket medical expenses; variation in regional cost of living; and mortgage-free homeownership. Under this method, the rate of poverty is estimated to be higher than the rate calculated in the traditional manner, rising from 12.4 percent in the official measure to 16 percent in the new measure; the rate of child poverty is more than 3 percentage points higher, and elderly poverty is nearly 7 points higher","10.7916/d8zg72x4","4.0","Garfinkel; Irwin; Hutto; Nathan; Kaushal; Neeraj; Waldfogel; Jane","2011.0","","","poverty"

"Heterogeneous Convergence","We use US county-level data containing 3,058 cross-sectional observations and 41 conditioning variables to study economic growth and explore possible heterogeneity in growth determination across 32 individual states. Using a 3SLS-IV estimation method, we find that the convergence rates for 32 individual states are above 2 percent, with an average of 8.1 percent. For 7 states the convergence rate can be rejected as identical to at least one other state’s convergence rate with 95 percent confidence. Convergence rates are negatively correlated with initial income. The size of government at all levels of decentralization is either unproductive or negatively correlated with growth. Educational attainment has a non-linear relationship with growth. The size of the finance, insurance and real estate, and entertainment industries are positively correlated with growth, while the size of the education industry is negatively correlated with growth. Heterogeneity in the effects of balanced growth path determinants across individual states is harder to detect than in convergence rates","10.2139/ssrn.947843","3.0","Higgins; Matthew; Levy; Daniel; Young; Andrew","2006.0","","","convergence"
"Using administrative records to support the linkage of census data: protocol for building a longitudinal infrastructure of U.S. census records","This article describes the linkage methods that will be used in the Decennial Census Digitization and Linkage project (DCDL), which is completing the final four decades of a longitudinal census infrastructure covering the past 170 years of United States history. DCDL is digitizing and creating linkages between nearly a billion records across the 1960 through 1990 U.S. censuses, as well as to already-linked records from the censuses of 1940, 2000, 2010, and 2020. Our main goals in this article are to (1) describe the development of the DCDL and the protocol we will follow to build the linkages between the census files, (2) outline the techniques we will use to evaluate the quality of the links, and (3) show how the assignment and evaluation of these linkages leverages the joint use of routinely collected administrative data and non-routine survey data","10.23889/ijpds.v7i4.1764","2.0","Joseph Alexander; Katie Genadek","2023.0","","Decennial Census","records; linkage; census; protocol; infrastructure; u; s"

"Avoiding disclosure of individually identifiable health information: a literature review","Achieving data and information dissemination without arming anyone is a central task of any entity in charge of collecting data. In this article, the authors examine the literature on data and statistical confidentiality. Rather than comparing the theoretical properties of specific methods, they emphasize the main themes that emerge from the ongoing discussion among scientists regarding how best to achieve the appropriate balance between data protection, data utility, and data dissemination. They cover the literature on de-identification and reidentification methods with emphasis on health care data. The authors also discuss the benefits and limitations for the most common access methods. Although there is abundant theoretical and empirical research, their review reveals lack of consensus on fundamental questions for empirical practice: How to assess disclosure risk, how to choose among disclosure methods, how to assess reidentification risk, and how to measure utility loss","10.1177/2158244011431279","7.0","Borton; Joshua; Fernandes-Huessy; Johannes; Gonzalez; Claudia; Hair; Elizabeth; Holden; Craig; Mulcahy; Tim; Prada; Sergio I","2011.0","","","disclosure; health; information; literature; review"
"Am J Ind Med","BackgroundOccupational status, a core component of socioeconomic status, plays a critical role in the well-being of U.S. workers. Identifying work-related disparities can help target prevention efforts.MethodsBureau of Labor Statistics workplace data were used to characterize high-risk occupations and examine relationships between demographic and work-related variables and fatality.ResultsEmployment in high-injury/illness occupations was independently associated with being male, Black, 64high school degree, foreign-birth, and low-wages. Adjusted fatal occupational injury rate ratios for 2005\u20132009 were elevated for males, older workers, and several industries and occupations. Agriculture/forestry/fishing and mining industries and transportation and materials moving occupations had the highest rate ratios. Homicide rate ratios were elevated for Black, American Indian/Alaska Native/Asian/Pacific Islanders, and foreign-born workers.ConclusionsThese findings highlight the importance of understanding patterns of disparities of workplace injuries, illnesses and fatalities. Results can improve intervention efforts by developing programs that better meet the needs of the increasingly diverse U.S. workforce.20142015-09-01T00:00:00ZAVS0/Intramural CDC HHS/United States24436156PMC4556419721","","0.0","","","","","am; j; ind; med"
"Parameter estimation and bias correction for diffusion processes and a nonparametric approach to census population size estimation","The first part of the dissertation considers parameter estimation for continuous-time diffusion processes which are commonly used to model dynamics of financial securities including interest rates. To understand why the drift parameters are more difficult to estimate than the diffusion parameter as observed in many empirical studies, we develop expansions for the bias and variance of parameter estimators for two mostly employed interest rate processes. A parametric bootstrap procedure is proposed to correct bias in parameter estimation of general diffusion processes with a theoretical justification. Simulation studies confirm the theoretical findings and show that the bootstrap proposal can effectively reduce both the bias and the mean square error of parameter estimates for both univariate and multivariate processes. The advantages of using more accurate parameter estimators when calculating various option prices in finance are demonstrated by an empirical study on a Fed fund rate data.;The second part of the dissertation considers a new approach to the dual system estimation for the US Census. Nonparametric estimators for the probability functions of Census enumeration and correct enumeration are proposed, which may be treated as an alternative to the existing post-stratification scheme currently being adapted in the Census undercount estimation. The proposed estimators can handle missing values, categorical covariates and can be used for model diagnostic and checking. An imputation based estimator is shown to have superior theoretical properties than estimators which simply ignore missing values. The proposed approach is employed to analyze data files from the 2000 US Census","10.31274/rtd-180813-17006","1.0","Tang; Chengyong","2008.0","","","parameter; correction; diffusion; processes; population; size"
